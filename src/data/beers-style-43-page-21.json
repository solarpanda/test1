He found the perfect spot in Charlottesville, VA \u2013 an historic storefront on Main Street that was once home to the state of Virginia\u2019s first craft brewing operation. In September 1999, Starr Hill Brewery was founded. Named after the local neighborhood, the brewery shared its space with the legendary Starr Hill Music Hall. Since then Starr Hill's delicious craft beers have become a favorite to visiting beer lovers, musicians, and music fans from around the world.\r\n\r\nIn response to the growing demand, Starr Hill moved from this small operation to a larger facility several miles outside of town in 2005. The brewery and tap room are still based in Crozet, nestled in the rolling foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Starr Hill's year-round, seasonal and limited-release brews are now enjoyed in bars, restaurants and music venues in the Mid Atlantic and Southeast and are also available at many grocery and convenience stores throughout the region. Among the most award-winning breweries on the East Coast, Starr Hill has won 21 Great American Beer Festival, World Beer Cup and Great British Beer Festival medals.\r\n\r\nLed by Brewmaster Robbie O'Cain, Starr Hill's team is striving to make creative and world-class beer every day.

We also brew seasonal, collaborative and barrel-aged beers.\r\n\r\nOur award-winning beers are on draft and bottled and are available throughout the United States in bars, restaurants and retail outlets.","website":"http:\/\/www.greenflashbrew.com\/","established":"2002","mailingListUrl":"www.greenflashbrew.com\/subscribe\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Nj8cgD\/upload_8QinVn-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Nj8cgD\/upload_8QinVn-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Nj8cgD\/upload_8QinVn-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Nj8cgD\/upload_8QinVn-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Nj8cgD\/upload_8QinVn-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2016-04-28 14:20:34","locations":[{"id":"hUoCwr","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"6550 Mira Mesa Blvd","locality":"San Diego","region":"California","postalCode":"92121","phone":"858-622-0085","website":"http:\/\/www.greenflashbrew.com\/","latitude":32.9071241,"longitude":-117.1778148,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2003","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-12-04 15:36:20","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"S16BzO","name":"Silverback Warfare","nameDisplay":"Silverback Warfare","description":"From Sixpoint head brewer Ian McConnell, a more beastly version of Sixpoint\u2019s Gorilla Warfare Coffee Porter.

This process implies that a natural sediment may remain in the bottle. This sediment can easily be consumed, but if an aesthetic beer experience is desired, pour the beer gently into the glass without the sediment.

In 1886 Adam Schumacher bought the brewery and started brewing beer. In 1906, the Potosi Brewing Company was founded by Adam and his brothers Nicholas and Henry. At its peak, the Potosi Brewery had grown to be the fifth largest in Wisconsin, shipping a variety of labels including Good Old Potosi, Holiday, Garten Brau, Augsburger and others to destinations throughout the United States. In 1972 the brewery ceased operations and closed its doors.\r\n\r\nThe restoration of the Potosi Brewery began in 1995 when Gary David bought the ruined Potosi Brewery Bottling buildings. This nearly one square block of buildings had just suffered a major fire and most of the buildings were a total loss. After working three years to rebuild parts of what had been destroyed, Gary then turned his attention to the Brewery itself. Being awarded the high bid at the county auction he then enlisted the help of his friend Rick Tobin and cousin Denis David. It was the marketing genius of Denis and his wife Madonna in 1999 that brought the public on board through a community meeting. This meeting was overwhelmingly attended by the public and brought forth numerous suggestions as well as additional support. It was this gathering of the public that led to the formation of the Potosi Brewery Foundation in February of 2000.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, with restoration underway, the Potosi Brewery Foundation was selected by the American Breweriana Association to be the home to its national museum. According to Len Chylack, president of the American Breweriana Association, Potosi was selected over cities such as Milwaukee and St. Louis because of their passion for beer, brewery history and beer-making culture.","website":"http:\/\/www.potosibrewery.com\/","established":"1852","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_ZDaYgp-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_ZDaYgp-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_ZDaYgp-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_ZDaYgp-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_ZDaYgp-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2016-06-24 17:44:52","locations":[{"id":"HeStKS","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"209 South Main Street","extendedAddress":"Box 177","locality":"Potosi","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"53820","phone":"608-763-4002","website":"http:\/\/www.potosibrewery.com\/","latitude":42.6716654,"longitude":-90.7271709,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1852","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"BrNgfR","name":"Smoked Yeti","nameDisplay":"Smoked Yeti","description":"YETI IMPERIAL STOUT is an onslaught of the senses.

It was a regular part of the Dead\u2019s early repertoire when it was sung by keyboardist Ron McKernan (Pigpen), disappeared after his death, and was revived in the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s when it was sung by Bob Weir.  Kind of an obvious choice for a big, dark stout that also packs some heat from the high ABV.  Smokestack Lightning is a very full bodied, dark beer with both coffee and chocolate aromas.  It is made with our signature Maris Otter malt with lots of dark malt added as well as some roasted barley.  Smokestack Lightning finishes strong with some roast malt astringency and notes of chocolate.","abv":"10.5","ibu":"50","glasswareId":8,"availableId":2,"styleId":43,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/KT3ZpQ\/upload_zWkNi2-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/KT3ZpQ\/upload_zWkNi2-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/KT3ZpQ\/upload_zWkNi2-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","originalGravity":"1.096","createDate":"2013-05-09 19:12:36","updateDate":"2015-12-17 02:18:10","glass":{"id":8,"name":"Tulip","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"style":{"id":43,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Imperial Stout","shortName":"American Imperial Stout","description":"Black in color, American-style imperial stouts typically have a high alcohol content.

This has been true since the day we quietly opened our first \u00bd barrel brewery and tap room on the west side of Decorah, IA in 2009. The batches were small but the taste was gigantic, and word spread like wildfire.\r\n\r\nToday, our team brews at a larger production facility on the edge of town, regularly experimenting at the tap room to satisfy our craving for new and exciting creations. Numbers are not our game, making a lot of the same beer is just too boring, and life is just too short.\r\n\r\nThe history of Toppling Goliath lies in the dreams of tomorrow, not the pages of the past. The past is for those who rely on high volume and low value. The past is for those who duplicate rather than design. The past is for cowards. We are forward thinkers and cunning crafters, quietly building our revolution. \u201cBig Beers Brewed in Small Batches.\u201d","website":"http:\/\/www.tgbrews.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ZQo2s5\/upload_D7u1f7-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ZQo2s5\/upload_D7u1f7-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ZQo2s5\/upload_D7u1f7-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ZQo2s5\/upload_D7u1f7-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ZQo2s5\/upload_D7u1f7-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:15:28","locations":[{"id":"tCTd8j","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"310 College Drive","extendedAddress":"PO Box 167","locality":"Decorah","region":"Iowa","postalCode":"52101","phone":"563-387-6700","website":"http:\/\/www.tgbrews.com\/","latitude":43.3082897,"longitude":-91.7970408,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2015-12-23 16:14:40","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
