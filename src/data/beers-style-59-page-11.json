We have a DIY ethic when it comes to our beer, our brewery and our business - in other words, we prefer to do things our own way (often, the hard way).  All of our beers' recipes were designed and perfected by us, and even our 5-barrel brewing system was custom built by the Jackrabbit crew.  If you come across our beer on tap, or in bottles at your local retailer, rest assured that we poured our passion for beer into every ounce.","website":"http:\/\/www.jackrabbitbrewingcompany.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/M6Drre\/upload_zdvb3Q-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/M6Drre\/upload_zdvb3Q-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/M6Drre\/upload_zdvb3Q-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/M6Drre\/upload_zdvb3Q-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/M6Drre\/upload_zdvb3Q-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-05-04 16:14:47","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:08:26","locations":[{"id":"tdu8Qi","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1323 Terminal St.","locality":"West Sacramento","region":"California","postalCode":"95691","hoursOfOperation":"Fri:  5:00pm - 9:00pm\nSat:  12:00pm - 9:00pm\n\n","latitude":38.5718525,"longitude":-121.5413488,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-05-04 19:56:39","updateDate":"2015-05-04 19:56:39","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"mpfjHg","name":"Tripel","nameDisplay":"Tripel","description":"Medium body and straw hue belie a beer of wondrous complexity.

In 2003 Skip and Phin purchased the defunct Old Saddle Back Brewing Co. in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. All the equipment was removed and brought back to Lakewood, New York and set up at its new 10,000 square foot home, The Southern Tier Brewing Company. The Brewery began operations in February 2004 distributing regionally. By 2005 sales covered the majority of the New York State and the eastern half of Pennsylvania. In the beginning their two Flagship brands were a Pilsner and Mild Ale. Oh yeah they also brewed IPA! As it turned out the flagships were a flop and the IPA was a huge success. They next launched a line of seasonal beers which have gained great success. Since the beginning, Southern Tier has experienced steady growth, currently distributing to over 25% of the United States. Multiple expansions have been made to keep up with demand and the brewery continues to be innovative by producing new products.

We have 10 regular craft beers on the market, with the occasional seasonal and \"let's make something cool!\" beer.\r\n\r\nVisit our small, cozy den - uh, taproom - and enjoy all of our craft beers plus 6 versions on nitro!  We don't have a kitchen, so you are welcome to bring your own food.  Kid and dog friendly (leashes, please).","website":"http:\/\/www.petalumahills.com\/","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/4BmCZn\/upload_JEOyW3-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/4BmCZn\/upload_JEOyW3-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/4BmCZn\/upload_JEOyW3-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/4BmCZn\/upload_JEOyW3-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/4BmCZn\/upload_JEOyW3-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:05","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:25:04","locations":[{"id":"aFNY2t","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1333 N.
