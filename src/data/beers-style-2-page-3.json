His family was collecting rice from farmers as land taxes for the Mito Tokugawa family. He began his brewery with the idea of using the remaining rice stocks in the warehouse. At this time in Japan a new political movement began to reform the Tokugawa regime. Fujita Toko, one of the movement's activists, advocated an ideology to build a new organizational government with a reverence of the emperor, and his thought led to the Meiji Restoration.\r\n\r\nFujita was a close friend of Kiuchi, who named one of his sakes \"KIKUSAKARI\" as a respect to the emperor. KIKU (chrysanthemum) is a crest of the imperial household, and SAKARI means 'property'.\r\n\r\n1950's Mikio Kiuchi inherited the brewery legacy in 1950. It was the time when the sake industry flourished as the rapid growth of Japan's economy after the World War II. Although many sake breweries started mass producing low quality sake due to increased demand, Kiuchi Brewery maintained their policy of pursuing the best quality of sake with the optimum ingredients and craftsman-ship.\r\n\r\nHitachino Beer In autumn 1996, Kiuchi started beer brewing business, named the brand \"HITACHINO NEST BEER\" with unique owl character logo.\r\nOver the years, Kiuchi Brewery has gained Japan and worldwide attention by winning awards at numerous world beer competitions.\r\nIn 2000, Brew on Premises facilities has opened to introduce the Lager is the main stream in the beer industries in Japan.\r\n\r\nShochu Kiuchi Kiuchi built a Distillation facility in March, 2003. to aid with recycling and reduction of waste, beginning with the production of \"Shochu Kiuchi\" Distilled liquor made from Sakekasu (Sake lees) which is the by-product of Sake Brewing.\r\n\r\nThe wine brewing project is the latest challenge of Kiuchi Brewery. Kiuchi bought 4000 square meters of land next to the brewery for the vineyard. The grape seedlings, Merlot and Chardoney were imported from France. The vineyard produced its first crop in 2000.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, 3 tonnes of grapes were harvested producing 2000 Litres of Wine. This wine is hoped to be able to offer on a market as another prestigious Kiuchi brand in the near future...","website":"http:\/\/www.kodawari.cc\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/a2GCv8\/upload_CkHjaS-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/a2GCv8\/upload_CkHjaS-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/a2GCv8\/upload_CkHjaS-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/a2GCv8\/upload_CkHjaS-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/a2GCv8\/upload_CkHjaS-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:59","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:49:44","locations":[{"id":"01Bp2T","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1257 Kounosu","locality":"Naka-shi","region":"Ibaraki","phone":"+81 (0)29-298-0105","website":"http:\/\/www.kodawari.cc\/","latitude":36.46801,"longitude":140.475563,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"JP","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:59","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"JP","name":"JAPAN","displayName":"Japan","isoThree":"JPN","numberCode":392,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"w6kbvl","name":"Hogs Back Hopping Hog IPA","nameDisplay":"Hogs Back Hopping Hog IPA","description":"In the tradition of a true English IPA, Hopping Hog really packs a punch with its full on hop aroma and distinctive ruby colour.","abv":"5.4","styleId":2,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/w6kbvl\/upload_dFoX9A-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/w6kbvl\/upload_dFoX9A-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/w6kbvl\/upload_dFoX9A-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-01-15 17:37:53","updateDate":"2016-01-15 17:41:13","style":{"id":2,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"English-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"English IPA","description":"Most traditional interpretations of English-style India pale ales are characterized by medium-high hop bitterness with a medium to medium-high alcohol content.

Sometimes the timing just wasn\u2019t right, but in 2012 all their bottles have aligned.\r\n\r\nFrom being in the beer industry so many years, we decided to plan, we wanted to bring a small batch brewed craft beer that we would love, and one the average Canadian beer consumer would too.\r\n\r\nWe contacted an old friend and craft brewer with our thoughts. We talked obsessivly about the beer we needed to create. From the passion came the experiments, the tastings and the refinements, until we had something that we knew was special.\r\n\r\nNo investors, just what we managed to scrape together and fueled by a passion for craft beer. Taking a chance to do what you love and believe in is what Double trouble Brewing Co. is all about. This is how everything good starts. The first step is the biggest. We are not out to make a fortune, but to have people enjoy a delicious beer that tastes like love when it flows down your gullet.","website":"http:\/\/doubletroublebrewing.com\/","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-11-07 03:43:21","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:01:07","locations":[{"id":"FeAt61","name":"Main Brewery","locality":"Toronto","region":"Ontario","latitude":43.653226,"longitude":-79.3831843,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"CA","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-11-21 22:22:29","updateDate":"2014-12-23 13:04:47","country":{"isoCode":"CA","name":"CANADA","displayName":"Canada","isoThree":"CAN","numberCode":124,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"qfgRAw","name":"Hops Like Jagger","nameDisplay":"Hops Like Jagger","abv":"6.7","styleId":2,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-09-16 18:41:24","updateDate":"2015-09-16 19:12:22","style":{"id":2,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"English-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"English IPA","description":"Most traditional interpretations of English-style India pale ales are characterized by medium-high hop bitterness with a medium to medium-high alcohol content.

From a funky storefront on the famous Pacific Coast Highway the duo ran the \u201cPizza Port\u201d with a classic menu of pizza and chicken wings to which they added their own \u201cSan Diego\u201d twist.  The Original Pizza Port in Solana Beach\r\n\r\nThe parking was limited and the building crowded with simple hand-built picnic tables and a hodge-podge d\u00e9cor of surf-related paraphernalia almost at odds with the sophisticated flavors of the food. But word spread quickly and it wasn\u2019t long before Pizza Port was a local favorite. \r\n\r\nEarly on Vince took advantage of free space in the restaurant\u2019s storage area to dabble with home brewing. The hobby took off and he was eventually brewing more than could reasonably be consumed at home. So at the urging of friends and fans, the Vince and Gina decided to go into the brewpub business. Pizza Port offered its first craft-brewed beers to patrons in 1992. \r\n\r\nEmbracing the same \u201cflavor-driven\u201d principles that had made the pizza menu so popular, Pizza Port quickly gained a reputation in San Diego\u2019s nascent craft beer scene. In 1997 the company opened a second location a few miles north of Solana Beach in Carlsbad, and a third in 2003 in San Clemente. The same year San Clemente opened (as well as the year after), the original location in Solana Beach won Great American Beer Festival \u201cSmall Brewpub of the Year\u201d. \r\n\r\nThe Pizza Port family\u2019s reputation for great foods and craft beer continued to grow, making them landmarks not just for Southern Californians, but for beer lovers from around the world. In 2008 they opened a premium bottle shop with more that 600 craft beers adjacent to the Carlsbad locations, and by the end of the first decade of the 21st century, the Pizza Ports were a brewing dynasty. In 2009 the Pizza Ports won a staggering 9 medals at the 2009 Great American Beer Festival and Pizza Port Carlsbad was named \u201cLarge Brewpub of the Year\u201d.","website":"http:\/\/www.pizzaport.com\/","established":"1987","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QSVVxD\/upload_g7L5OH-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QSVVxD\/upload_g7L5OH-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QSVVxD\/upload_g7L5OH-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QSVVxD\/upload_g7L5OH-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QSVVxD\/upload_g7L5OH-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:10:31","locations":[{"id":"DrFlD0","name":"Carlsbad","streetAddress":"571 Carlsbad Village Dr.","locality":"Carlsbad","region":"California","postalCode":"92008","phone":"760-720-7007","website":"http:\/\/www.pizzaport.com\/locations\/carlsbad\/","latitude":33.1596505,"longitude":-117.3478111,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1997","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"qAyZMR","name":"Solana Beach","streetAddress":"135 N.
