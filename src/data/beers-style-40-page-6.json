He designed a plane and built it with $1800 fom his parents after they had mortgaged their home.  Anxious to try his new design, he promptly flew and crashed the plane, demolishing it.  He redesigned and successfully flew his plane, possibly making him the first person in Fort Wayne to fly on his own.  This earned him the name Birdboy.

The process of appreciation through education we call beer liberation.\r\n\r\nToday Short\u2019s Brewing Company continues the effort to educate and liberate consumers.  We take pride in our hands on, mom and pop approach and the energy we put into the quality of our beer, food, staff, customers and facilities. We believe in the power of the smallness.   We intend on remaining a smaller, state wide beer distributor and focusing our energies close to home (the SBC Michigan stimulus package).
