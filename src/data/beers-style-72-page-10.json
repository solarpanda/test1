When fermented at elevated temperatures pushing 90 degrees F, we are able to pull out complex flavors and aromas of lemon, pepper, clove, and tart citrus.\r\n\r\nWe crafted this special beer by adding 16 pounds of organic dried Hibiscus Flowers in the mash tun with Belgian Pilsner malt and German Pale Wheat malt of the absolute highest quality.  The addition of this flower, also known as the \u201cRose Mallow\u201d, lends a pleasant tartness, floral aromas, and smooth quality to Efflorescence that compliment the profile of our special yeast strain.\r\n\r\nEfflorescence is an extraordinary example of a classic farmhouse ale that has become a standard in the Funk Brewing repertoire due to its delicate complexity, session-ability, and wide appeal to both the novice drinker and the experienced farmhouse connoisseur.","abv":"4.8","styleId":72,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/2i8UrJ\/upload_2RqSfi-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/2i8UrJ\/upload_2RqSfi-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/2i8UrJ\/upload_2RqSfi-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-02 14:33:51","updateDate":"2015-12-17 16:32:51","style":{"id":72,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"French & Belgian-Style Saison","shortName":"Saison","description":"Beers in this category are golden to deep amber in color.

It also means that we can afford to brew many different styles of beer in smaller quantities with attention to traditional styles and creative \"experiments\". Instead of having a few flagship beers available at all times, we release two new beers each month. These are only around while they last and then will be supplanted by the next styles in line. You can think about it as brewing only *seasonals* such as a stout or a winter warmer in the winter, a nice malty brown in the fall, or a refreshing kolsch or hefeweizen in the summer. However, the best received ones will get duplicated (but not that often) and quite possibly may become flagship beers down the line.","website":"http:\/\/www.nwpeaksbrewery.com\/","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/eRdXNO\/upload_diW6z6-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/eRdXNO\/upload_diW6z6-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/eRdXNO\/upload_diW6z6-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/eRdXNO\/upload_diW6z6-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/eRdXNO\/upload_diW6z6-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:04","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:20:35","locations":[{"id":"PG4ybp","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"4912 17th Avenue Northwest","extendedAddress":"Suite B","locality":"Seattle","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98107","phone":"206-853-0525","latitude":47.664834,"longitude":-122.378656,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"nano","locationTypeDisplay":"Nano Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:04","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"NLF18P","name":"Enkel","nameDisplay":"Enkel","description":"Hearken back to a simpler time when fields of barley and wheat danced in the breeze and the sound of scythe and sickle sliced the day.

The other half of it is right here. The power of the internet, social media, and networking is here to see. Think of this as your own internet brewpub where you can sidle up next to the brewmaster and ask a question \u2014 because you can.\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s so Mysterious?\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a bit of a throwback. \u201cMystery\u201d in its original definition meant the \u201cart and craft of a trade.\u201d  Brewers were among the first organized trade groups; there is evidence of a guild of brewers as early as 12th Century London: \u201cthe Master, Keepers or Wardens and Commonalty of the Mistery or Art of Brewers of the City of London\u201d. So, it\u2019s a tribute, it\u2019s recognition that there is just as much art to brewing as there is science, and it\u2019s a gentle reminder that to move forward and create a truly excellent future, sometimes you have to look at the past.","website":"http:\/\/www.mysterybrewing.com\/","established":"2011","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/eepurl.com\/goT5b","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/L29NU9\/upload_kPo6B5-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/L29NU9\/upload_kPo6B5-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/L29NU9\/upload_kPo6B5-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/L29NU9\/upload_kPo6B5-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/L29NU9\/upload_kPo6B5-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:03","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:20:55","locations":[{"id":"xoGGQz","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"437 Dimmocks Mill Road","extendedAddress":"Suite 41","locality":"Hillsborough","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"27278","phone":"919-697-8379","website":"http:\/\/www.mysterybrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Brewery open for public tours Saturday afternoon from 12.30pm until 4.30pm.

Then we balance the beer with classic noble hops for a balanced bitterness and spicy aroma.

You can also see why we have been known over the years as the \"D Family\", or simply \"The D's\". The family has since expanded with the addition of two daughters-in-law -- Talar and Rachel -- and grandson's Nico (so much for that \"D\" thing!) and Dillon. We've always been a very close family and love doing things together whether it's vacations, home improvement projects, sporting events, or just hanging out. We've long had a dream of starting our own business, and so we finally decided to take our love of craft beer, combined with our home-brewing experience, to create Four Sons Brewing. The picture below is a shot of the whole group and when you visit our tasting room you will likely see most (if not all) of us there. (Oh, by the way, we are huge LA Kings fans!).
