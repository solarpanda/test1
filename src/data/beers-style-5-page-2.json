They met in September 2002 in the tiny Scottish village of St. Andrews, Scotland. Bailey was a Harvard student doing a semester abroad and Robyn was beginning undergrad at St. Andrews. They bonded over being put into the worst dorm for overseas orientation and teaching Danish people how to play beer pong. Though after three months Bailey went back to Cambridge, you can't break the bonds that are made when teaching Europeans drinking games and a true friendship was born. During the next eight years, they both graduated, Bailey went off to Vanderbilt Law School, and Robyn entered the working world, but both thought they were meant for much bigger and more alcoholic things.","website":"http:\/\/www.jackalopebrew.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/p1tFbP\/upload_FgvJzY-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/p1tFbP\/upload_FgvJzY-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/p1tFbP\/upload_FgvJzY-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/p1tFbP\/upload_FgvJzY-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/p1tFbP\/upload_FgvJzY-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:04:10","locations":[{"id":"Syl46S","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"701 8th Avenue South","locality":"Nashville","region":"Tennessee","postalCode":"37203","phone":"857-998-2571","website":"http:\/\/www.jackalopebrew.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Thursday: 4PM - 8PM\r\nFriday: 4PM - 8PM\r\nSaturday: 4PM - 8PM","latitude":36.1503749,"longitude":-86.779494,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"1EXMW3","name":"Bitter Winter","nameDisplay":"Bitter Winter","description":"Pale amber in colour.

Its award-winning roster of year round, season and specialty products have gained the Brewery notoriety as one of the top craft beer producers in the world. Brooklyn beers are currently distributed in 25 states and 17 countries, and throughout 2011 the brewery underwent an expansion that will double overall capacity by 2013. In addition to facilitating community meetings at its event space, brewery employees serve on not-for-profit boards, including the Prospect Park Alliance, the Open Space Alliance, Transportation Alternatives and the Brooklyn Historical Society. Each year the company supports many charitable and arts organizations including BAM, Brooklyn Museum and MoMA, and partners with food purveyors across the country to produce beer dinners and tasting events.

All of our specialty malts are imported from the UK, as is our unique strain of yeast. The ales are naturally carbonated and left to settle or \"fine\" at cold temperatures, rather than being filtered. Filtration can remove much of the goodness from beer along with the haze. Another negative practice our Brewer avoids is pasteurization. Our natural and healthy brews are more lightly carbonated than the factory product, and served at a palatable 45 degrees F to bring out the fullness of the flavour for which we strive.","website":"http:\/\/swanshotel.com","established":"1989","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BMC26E\/upload_u1MdsV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BMC26E\/upload_u1MdsV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BMC26E\/upload_u1MdsV-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BMC26E\/upload_u1MdsV-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BMC26E\/upload_u1MdsV-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-08 18:03:14","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:46:24","locations":[{"id":"pcNq92","name":"Swans Brewery","streetAddress":"506 Pandora Ave","locality":"Victoria","region":"British Columbia","postalCode":"V8W 1N6","phone":"1-800-668-7926","website":"http:\/\/www.swanshotel.com","hoursOfOperation":"24 hours a day (hotel & info)","latitude":48.4285262,"longitude":-123.3694717,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"CA","yearOpened":"1989","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-12 17:27:49","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"CA","name":"CANADA","displayName":"Canada","isoThree":"CAN","numberCode":124,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"VSbgU9","name":"Buffalo Treaty ESB","nameDisplay":"Buffalo Treaty ESB","description":"As the follow up to Broken Promise Pale Ale and Buffalo Hump 1840 IPA comes this ESB in rememberence of the betrail that led to retailiation of Comanche chief Potsanaquahip of the Penataka band against Texas settlers who went against their word.

Russian River Brewing might be something completely different now if it weren't for this incredible opportunity.\r\nOn April 3, 2004, Vinnie and Natalie reopened RRBC as a brewpub in downtown Santa Rosa to great success and began self-distributing to nearby clients.
