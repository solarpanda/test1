The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery. Goose Island beers are now enjoyed in all 50 states and Europe.","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:46:51","locations":[{"id":"S2n5TB","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1800 West Fulton Street","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60612","phone":"1-800-466-7363","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","latitude":41.887107,"longitude":-87.6720969,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:33:51","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"D2gG2C","name":"Clybourn","streetAddress":"1800 North Clybourn Avenue","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60614","phone":"800-466-7363","latitude":41.9137242,"longitude":-87.65373,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1988","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:32:55","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Oklbuw","name":"Leghorn Rye IPA","nameDisplay":"Leghorn Rye IPA","description":"A play on a traditional India Pale Ale, the mash for Leghorn includes three different types of rye.

This journey has opened our eyes (and taste buds) to some of the finest examples of beer this planet has to offer. Our tastes and expectations have forever changed, and so have our methods of enjoyment. From beer trades, to home brewing, to attending release parties and festivals one thing became clear\u2026 We rarely drink the same beer over and over again, and we love to share.\r\n\r\nOur IPAs will be constantly revolving depending on inspiration, hop variety, availability, and season. We will make everything from low gravity Sessions, to Regulars, Doubles, Triples and even a San Diego Pale Ale or two. We will make sure these styles are released, distributed, and tapped\u2026 FRESH!\r\n\r\nWe like big beers and we cannot lie! From the biggest Russian Imperial Stouts aged in spirit barrels to malty Double Reds, Smooth Porters, and velvety Wee Heavies, we just can\u2019t get enough of these complex beauties. Thick mouthfeel, high gravity, and rich flavors suitable for aging to be shared with family and friends. Crack one open to celebrate a special occasion, or just because its a Tuesday.\r\n\r\nMouth puckering sour ales is another style which we adore. One which we hoard, savor, and curse for not being more readily available. Using wine barrels from local Virginia Wineries we will age some carefully crafted super tart ales, blending them when needed and using fruits for character. Once the bugs catch up to our pipeline, expect a new sour to be released every month.\r\n\r\nAt Ocelot, we love two things\u2026 Beer and Music!\r\n\r\nWe believe in inspiration. It can come in many forms and varies from person to person. For us, music has always been our inspiration. Music has been the soundtrack to our lives and has in one way or another crafted every decision we\u2019ve made. We aim to create and dedicate our beers to the music that has inspired our journey through life.\r\n\r\nOcelot Brewing Company is a reflection of us, our styles, and our habits. From chasing freshies to cellaring whales and everything in between. We will craft many different beers in small batches. We brew beer we want to drink when we want to drink it.

We knew what we wanted to drink, but we needed some help actually brewing it. So we enlisted our first brewer, took over some warehouse space on the Boston waterfront, and began introducing fresh, local craft beer to Boston drinkers. We tried to do it in a way that captured the spirit of fun that had brought us to beer in the first place. From that warehouse, surrounded by fish companies on the docks of South Boston (neighboring what is now the Seaport District), we couldn\u2019t imagine that craft brewing would become what it has today.  \r\n\r\nWe still remember our days on the other side of the bar, and have spent as much time spreading the joy of beer drinking as we have focusing on recipes, ingredients, and brewing equipment. Hopefully our sense of gratitude is reflected in both the quality of the beer and the spirit of fun and enjoyment surrounding our beer and breweries. We invite all of you to visit our Boston brewery, where it all began, and our beautiful brewery in Windsor, Vermont.","website":"http:\/\/www.harpoonbrewery.com\/","established":"1986","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/RzvedX\/upload_AbOUmA-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/RzvedX\/upload_AbOUmA-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/RzvedX\/upload_AbOUmA-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/RzvedX\/upload_AbOUmA-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/RzvedX\/upload_AbOUmA-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:57","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:47:47","locations":[{"id":"AGRvvY","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"336 Ruth Carney Drive","locality":"Windsor","region":"Vermont","postalCode":"05089","phone":"802-674-5491","website":"http:\/\/www.harpoonbrewery.com\/","latitude":43.5130201,"longitude":-72.4016913,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1986","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:57","updateDate":"2014-10-06 15:45:55","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"9aSjFg","name":"Boston","streetAddress":"306 Northern Avenue","locality":"Boston","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"02210","phone":"1-888-HARPOON","website":"http:\/\/www.harpoonbrewery.com","latitude":42.3465,"longitude":-71.033843,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1986","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2014-09-26 14:01:43","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"ZiAK1m","name":"LEXICAL GAP","nameDisplay":"LEXICAL GAP","description":"Sometimes, the English language just doesn\u2019t have a word for something.

Their love of beer began in the 90\u2019s, which eventually lead to homebrewing, and an endless pursuit of finding the best craft beers the World had to offer.\r\n\r\nThey chose the name \"Chandeleur\" in honor of one of their favorite places, the Chandeleur Islands off the coast of Mississippi. The uninhabited island chain is approximately 50 miles long and is home to some of the best redfish and speckled trout fishing on the planet.\r\n\r\nCam and Cain were born and raised in Gulfport, MS. Being raised on the coast instilled in them a true love for the water. When they\u2019re not brewing beer, you\u2019re almost guaranteed to find them fishing or cruising in a boat with family.\r\n\r\nAs they gained a real passion for craft beer and continued to hone their homebrewing skills, they began to dream about opening their own microbrewery. Several years later, in July of 2012, Senate Bill 2878 became law, raising the permissible alcohol content in Mississippi beer from 5% by weight (6.25%ABV) to 8% by weight (10.1% ABV). The fellas knew that it was high time to start making their dream into a reality. And, they knew that Mississippi was the place to do it.\r\n\r\nIn December of 2013, they purchased a historic building in downtown Gulfport and broke ground for what is now Chandeleur Brewing Company. Their vision is to handcraft some of the most excellent ales on the Gulf Coast using only the finest, freshest malted barley, hops, and local ingredients.","website":"http:\/\/www.chandeleurbrew.com\/","established":"2015","mailingListUrl":"info@chandeleurbrew.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/nJFd7Y\/upload_JJE9yV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/nJFd7Y\/upload_JJE9yV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/nJFd7Y\/upload_JJE9yV-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/nJFd7Y\/upload_JJE9yV-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/nJFd7Y\/upload_JJE9yV-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-08 03:01:40","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:05:40","locations":[{"id":"n7K72G","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2711 14th Street","locality":"Gulfport","region":"Mississippi","postalCode":"39501","phone":"228-701-9985","website":"http:\/\/www.chandeleurbrew.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Thu:  4:00pm - 7:00pm\nFri:  4:00pm - 7:00pm\nSat:  1:00pm - 4:00pm\n\n","latitude":30.367822,"longitude":-89.09537,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2015","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-08 03:01:40","updateDate":"2015-03-13 17:16:03","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"a2g8c0","name":"Lil' Walker IPA","nameDisplay":"Lil' Walker IPA","description":"Combining a 2,600lb grain bill comprised of 2-Row Pale, Cara-Pils and Crystal 15 malts with generous hop additions of CTZ, Sterling and Ella, this beer is only little in name.

After experiencing the first IPA in the series, one customer's email remarked, \"You'd better not leave me sitting here in Limbo until you decide to brew some of your new IPA's year-round.\" And so became Limbo.\r\n\r\nAt 80 IBU's, we knew this Australian & West Coast hopped IPA warranted packaging that was equally as bold, so we broke the Long Trail mold and went to some unchartered territory. The package graphics and tap handles are like nothing we have ever done before and are sure to turn some heads. Limbo six packs will have a special die-cut design to showcase the artwork.

This is the hop harvest, in a glass, just for you.","abv":"7","ibu":"79","glasswareId":5,"styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/LRQUEF\/upload_RZi8A5-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/LRQUEF\/upload_RZi8A5-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/LRQUEF\/upload_RZi8A5-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:14","updateDate":"2015-12-16 13:47:57","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.
