Like the Saison (French for \u201cSeason\u201d) of old, our ale is brewed to be refreshing yet complex summer ale. The saison style was truly defined by the region, so the Wooden Legs Brewing Company version calls on unique hops, grains and cereal of the USA. The grain bill consists of American ale malt, malted wheat and even a touch of corn. Crystal hops provide a mild floral and the spice to balance out the malt. The Belgian yeast provides additional subtle spices and esters and ferments to a wonderful cloudy complexion.","abv":"5.8","styleId":72,"isOrganic":"Y","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-07-14 17:26:21","updateDate":"2015-07-14 17:26:21","style":{"id":72,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"French & Belgian-Style Saison","shortName":"Saison","description":"Beers in this category are golden to deep amber in color.

His horse slipped and fell into Split Rock Creek in the freezing weather. Brookings made it safely to Yankton, but his wet legs had suffered such severe frostbite they both needed to be amputated. He spent the rest of his life using a pair of squeaky, wooden legs.","website":"http:\/\/www.woodenlegsbrewing.com\/","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:13","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:23:13","locations":[{"id":"NuaM0n","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"3011 5th St","locality":"Brookings","region":"South Dakota","postalCode":"57006","phone":"605-549-5624","website":"http:\/\/www.woodenlegsbrewing.com\/","latitude":44.31022,"longitude":-96.779609,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:13","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"pi2qkU","name":"Farmhouse Ale","nameDisplay":"Farmhouse Ale","abv":"5.1","styleId":72,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-10-14 15:52:16","updateDate":"2015-10-14 15:52:16","style":{"id":72,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"French & Belgian-Style Saison","shortName":"Saison","description":"Beers in this category are golden to deep amber in color.

Grinding it out everyday for a fee, wearing suits and kissing butt.\r\n\r\nThen this brewery chose us...she forced us to ask ourselves, \"Is this desk job really how I pictured my life?\"  We answered that questions by taking over River Horse in 2007 and have not looked back.  We may not end up as the greatest success story on earth, but at least we had the balls to try.  Sometimes, for better or worse, your dreams get the best of you.\r\n\r\nJust remember, it's a big world out there and cubicles don't have doors, so you can walk out anytime.

Our brewers, George, Bob, & Eric come from diverse brewing backgrounds which we believe, despite butting heads occasionally, is a great strength to be harnessed. Rather than setting forth a staunch regiment of a certain style of beer, we want Rexx to grow and progress organically. The artist Robert Motherwell once said \"A subject emerges from an interaction between my self, my I, and my medium.\" This is the same process we employ in the creation of our beers. Each beer is born out of a free flowing of ideas; a collaborative exchange of concepts between intellectual thesis and recipe. This then leads to lots of pilot brewing which often leads to further discussion of concept until ultimately either the beer style is determined by the concept or vice versa. This process allows for a great amount of freedom and creativity to already be present at the beginning of every new project.","website":"http:\/\/www.rexxreserve.com\/","established":"2015","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/eepurl.com\/bb8GTP","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/oMc5DI\/upload_zQXHRG-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/oMc5DI\/upload_zQXHRG-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/oMc5DI\/upload_zQXHRG-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/oMc5DI\/upload_zQXHRG-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/oMc5DI\/upload_zQXHRG-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-05-27 17:41:08","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:09:27","locations":[{"id":"EzrIDK","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1203 New Windsor Rd.","locality":"Westminster","region":"Maryland","phone":"(410) 861-0415","latitude":39.555824,"longitude":-77.041126,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-05-28 16:38:00","updateDate":"2015-05-28 16:38:00","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"04UTFb","name":"Festival Saison","nameDisplay":"Festival Saison","description":"Enjoy a creative take on a classic summer style, made with spicy rye malt and pink peppercorn for a zesty and refreshing thirst-quenching brew.
