This full flavored ale is nicely balanced with Cascade hops from the American Northwest.

Our special barley wine is made with English 2-row barley and Vienna malt. Its robust, malty, caramel flavor is balanced by lots and lots of hops, giving it a great depth of character. Drink only in moderation, the colorful name is not all that will grab your attention.

This smalltime hobby of making beer in a tiny apartment blossomed into a fulltime career, brewing commercially. Towards the end of 1993, Tim attended UC Davis in Northern California to study Fermentation Science. Upon returning to Salt Lake, he aligned himself with a startup brewery called Uinta Brewing Company. The concept for this startup was to brew the freshest beer available in the State of Utah while limiting the alcohol percentage to 3.2 by weight (4% by volume). It was wildly successful, providing locally made beer for the ski areas and the many tourists that visited Utah.","website":"http:\/\/tenayacreek.com\/","established":"1999","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/MSB2i0\/upload_sTNcTl-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/MSB2i0\/upload_sTNcTl-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/MSB2i0\/upload_sTNcTl-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/MSB2i0\/upload_sTNcTl-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/MSB2i0\/upload_sTNcTl-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2016-06-27 12:20:00","locations":[{"id":"HtFqFO","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"831 W Bonanza Rd","locality":"Las Vegas","region":"Nevada","postalCode":"89106","phone":"702-362-7335","website":"http:\/\/tenayacreek.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Daily: 11:00 a.m. to 2:00 a.m.\r\nClosed on Independence Day, Thanksgiving and Christmas.","latitude":36.176722,"longitude":-115.15317,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1999","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2016-06-28 13:35:55","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"2n82YE","name":"Old Kaya Dog","nameDisplay":"Old Kaya Dog","description":"An American Barleywine with hints of light fruit and alcohol warmth.

Following fourteen months of design, building and construction they finally fired up the brew kettle for the first time in December of 1999. Although the brewery was tiny and tucked in a basement on Pearl Street, the celebration and Grand Opening was enough to attract throngs of flavor starved people and get Mayor Medinger to tap the inaugural keg.\r\n\r\nWe have come a long way since. Today we brew, bottle and keg our beers from our new home in the historic La Crosse Footwear building with our expanded 30 barrel brewery.

Owned by John Harris. John\u2019s vision is a destination restaurant and brewery. His goal is to push the limits of creativity in the brewhouse, and create a sense of place in both the restaurant and the beer he builds. \r\n\r\nJohn\u2019s background is one steeped in Oregon\u2019s rich history in craft brewing. He spent his first two years, from 1986-1988, as a brewer at McMenamins\u2019 breweries; his next four were at Deschutes, where he created the recipes for Mirror Pond, Black Butte Porter and Obsidian Stout; and John spent the next 20 years of his illustrious career as a brewmaster at Full Sail. He is now starting the next chapter with the creation of Ecliptic Brewing.","website":"http:\/\/www.eclipticbrewing.com","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/2w0Re3\/upload_InC8gy-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/2w0Re3\/upload_InC8gy-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/2w0Re3\/upload_InC8gy-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/2w0Re3\/upload_InC8gy-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/2w0Re3\/upload_InC8gy-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-11-01 17:06:40","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:48:11","locations":[{"id":"x9Ssna","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"825 N Cook Street","locality":"Portland","region":"Oregon","postalCode":"97227","website":"http:\/\/eclipticbrewing.com","latitude":45.5473404,"longitude":-122.6750989,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-11-01 17:07:19","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
