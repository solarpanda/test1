They named the brewery as a nod to Kevin\u2019s love of nautical history.\r\n\r\nDry Dock expanded in 2009, and again in 2011. Now the brewery runs a 7 BBL brewhouse including a tasting room with 180 seats and 16 taps at its original location at 15120 E. Hampden Avenue which is called South Dock.\r\n\r\nIn 2013, Dry Dock nearly quadrupled its production numbers, jumping from 3,200 barrels in 2012 to 12,000 barrels in one year. This increase came with the purchase of a 30,000-square-foot production facility, North Dock, at 2801 Tower Road. At North Dock, Dry Dock has the capacity to expand to brew more than 30,000 barrels a year, and cans its flagship line of beers, including the Amber Ale, Hop Abomination, Hefeweizen, and Apricot Blonde.\r\n\r\nIn September of 2014, Dry Dock opened the Canoe Room, a four-tap tasting room inside of its North Dock facility. The tasting room, which in addition to draft beer, serves Dry Dock\u2019s canned offerings.

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.

Always looking to take a good thing too far, we sat down and over a beer (or two) decided that beer itself was a good idea. Of course, not just some easy-drinking institutional prole beer, but stuff like the beers we'd had at great bars. We had frequented places with extensive and varied beer lists. Places with lists 180 items long, all of which we tried twice (not in one night). In short, we wanted beer with flavor. Complexity. Character. Intensity. Not words found in the mass market lexicon.\r\n\r\nSo with a banjo burner, a bunch of industrial kitchen sized pots and as many buckets as we could find, we jumped in feet first. Once a week, every week. We tried to emulate the beers we liked, but soon we were adding a little of this, or some of that and after a while we started having a hard time pegging our beer in a style category. Our first success was a Porter that was mainly porter, slightly stout. We ran it blind with our friends against the porters we liked and people liked it. \"We're on to something\", we thought. Twenty iterations, modifications and tweaks later it is Distorter, and is still our favorite beer.\r\n\r\nThis led to twice a week brewing and handing out bottle after bottle to everyone we knew. Along the way we screwed up a wheat beer by accidentally making it into sort of a copper ale with a few too many hops. And so Red Bud Ale was born. We had some extra noble hops and threw them in the IPA, and with some tinkering we most certainly had a one-of-a-kind IPA. You get the picture. All of this has firmly cemented our \"anything goes\" approach to beer making. Our inability to ever get quite within the style guidelines means we may never win an award, but we're ok with that.\r\n\r\nNow, several years later and with a 90% super-cool\/10% Rube Goldberg 7 bbl version of our banjo burner and kitchen pots, we're befuddling the beer judges and converting the masses. One pint at a time.\r\n\r\nStop in the storefront and try our mainstays, seasonals and small-batch runs. Not to mention our lab beers, where we continue to screw up one thing or another in search of the next great beer.","website":"http:\/\/www.greenbushbrewing.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:19:53","locations":[{"id":"AlhRYb","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"5885 Sawyer Rd.","locality":"Sawyer","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49125","phone":"269-405-1076","website":"http:\/\/www.greenbushbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sunday - Thursday: 12-8\r\nFriday and Saturday: 12-10","latitude":41.8856286,"longitude":-86.5946671,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"LguBkK","name":"Dungeon Master Black","nameDisplay":"Dungeon Master Black","description":"Earthy, spicy Columbus hops complimented by the roastiness of chocolate malts.","abv":"6","styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-08-12 01:30:50","updateDate":"2014-11-13 20:39:09","style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

Recently the 'More is More!' camp have moved this noble style ever in the direction of increased alcohol and bitterness, flashy new hop varieties, and a tendency towards one-upsmanship. We've taken a step back, thought about what makes a great every-day IPA, and returned to our beloved NW IPA's roots. Hops include classic varieties, including Cascade, Nugget and Willamette, with modern varieties Apollo and Zythos reflecting a nod to the future. ESB, Crystal 40, Special Aromatic, Wheat, Carahell, and Sour malts. Dryhopped and ran through several pounds of whole leaf Cascade in our hopback, Eagle Harbor presents a firm hop aroma, supported by enough malt character to keep you coming back for more.\r\n\r\nTHE STORY: As the story goes, India Pale Ale was a big, hoppy beer designed to survive passage in a ship's hold all the way to India. Eagle Harbor is the bay that Downtown Winslow adjoins and the location of the ferry terminal. Interestingly, Winslow was not the main settlement on the island for much of its history. Searching for a new harbor to build ever larger ships, in 1903 the Hall Brothers Shipyard relocated from Port Blakely to Eagle Harbor. The tiny settlement of Madrone was then renamed Winslow, after the deceased Winslow Hall. Eagle Harbor IPA is named for that fading dream of enormous five-masted schooners, sailing to distant shores.","abv":"6","ibu":"60","glasswareId":5,"availableId":1,"styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/vPNu3b\/upload_wnREfv-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/vPNu3b\/upload_wnREfv-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/vPNu3b\/upload_wnREfv-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-09-15 13:20:11","updateDate":"2015-12-16 19:19:20","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

Whole ingredients are used with traditional brewing equipment which is controlled by state of the art systems that manage temperature throughout the brewing process. These same systems harvest waste BTU's, capturing the energy that would normally be lost and reusing it to preheat ingredients, maintain product temperatures, and even heat the taproom via an in-floor heating system. Waste materials such as process water and spent grain are also captured and stored for fertilization and irrigation of our crops.\r\n\r\nThe prep table in the brewery quite often looks like the prep area in a fine restaurant. Fresh herbs, fruits and vegetables are a common sight, along with an amazing array of spices, roots and even flowers. Whole foods, fresh frozen or dried are used, artificial flavorings, extracts and coloring agents are not. The beer is unfiltered, its clarity being attained by the addition of natural clarifying agents and allowing ample time for the beer to condition.\r\n\r\nBrewery Terra Firma began brewing operations in May of 2013, with the taproom opening to the public in July of the same year.","website":"http:\/\/www.breweryterrafirma.com\/","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-11-18 12:30:28","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:48:26","locations":[{"id":"1QFuku","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2959 Hartman Rd","locality":"Traverse City","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49685","phone":"(231) 929-1600","website":"http:\/\/www.breweryterrafirma.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  10:00am - 10:00pm\nSun:  2:00pm - 9:00pm\n\n10:00 AM to 10:00 PM Monday through Saturday, and from 2:00 PM to 9:00 PM on Sunday","latitude":44.7154521,"longitude":-85.6354376,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-11-18 12:32:00","updateDate":"2014-09-29 20:36:47","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"PRSqsZ","name":"Earthrise","nameDisplay":"Earthrise","description":"Earthrise will give you a whole new perspective on hops and IPAs.

We've worked hard and are incredibly proud of the many successes we've enjoyed over the years. The Boston Beer Company has been cited as one of the best companies to work for by Boston Magazine, one of the Best Entry-Level Jobs by The Princeton Review, and our beers have won more awards than any other in history. Jim has been named an \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" by Inc. Magazine. Our brewers keep amazing us with innovative new brews, including Samuel Adams Utopias and our Samuel Adams Barrel Room Collection.\r\n\r\nJim has believed from the beginning that the more you know and understand about beer, the more you'll appreciate a beer like Samuel Adams Boston Lager. To begin that mission, all new employees go through intensive training on everything from ingredients, brewing, and beer styles, to taking care of the beer once it leaves the brewery. We're all beer lovers and protectors of the beer so we're trained how to identify off flavors and how to troubleshoot the causes. The passion for beer continues with an annual homebrew competition that we all take part in.\r\n\r\nOne of our wholesalers once asked Jim why he invested so much in training his people, when ultimately they might leave.

The villains of the peace in this story are two non-conformist, 'not likely to take it lying down' ranchers named George Stranahan and Richard McIntyre.\r\n\r\nAs George tells it, he and 11 of his closest friends and family decided to embark on what they called an \u201camateur mountaineering expedition\u201d to climb K2 in the Himalayas. Under-qualified and unprepared, they started their journey with a Sherpa, a donkey, and a suitcase full of contraband. Naturally, half way through the trip the contraband was gone and the Sherpa and donkey had run off, leaving George and his group to fend for themselves. Luckily, everyone managed to make it off the mountain alive, and with a new outlook on life.\r\n\r\nHorn Dog Denver Colorado BeerLike any good beer drinker would at the end of an experience like that, George and his group found a local Pakistani hotel bar to have a drink in. Now, alcohol is banned in most Muslim nations, but if you sign an affidavit stating you are the son of a Christian, it\u2019s like a license to drink. George gladly signed away and got down to some serious drinking. That\u2019s about the time he noticed a painting in the Flashman Hotel of a Flying Dog hanging on the wall that had been drawn by a local artist. Now, we all know dogs don\u2019t fly, but nobody told this particular dog it couldn\u2019t fly, just like no one had told George and his friends they couldn\u2019t make this extraordinary journey. The Flying Dog became a symbol that George and his group used to describe what had happened to them with the mantra, \u201cit is amazing what you can achieve if nobody tells you that you can't.","website":"http:\/\/www.flyingdogbrewery.com\/","established":"1990","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jmGoBA\/upload_H9xzdZ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jmGoBA\/upload_H9xzdZ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jmGoBA\/upload_H9xzdZ-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jmGoBA\/upload_H9xzdZ-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jmGoBA\/upload_H9xzdZ-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:46:05","locations":[{"id":"EPqUQP","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"4607 Wedgewood Blvd","locality":"Frederick","region":"Maryland","postalCode":"21703","phone":"301-694-7899","website":"http:\/\/www.flyingdogales.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Tours are offered every Thursday and Friday from 4 to 6 pm, along with two sessions on Saturday (12 to 2 pm and 2:30 - 4:30 pm).","latitude":39.361926,"longitude":-77.424677,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1983","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"WE4Dbe","name":"Easy IPA","nameDisplay":"Easy IPA","abv":"5.5","styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-07 21:05:27","updateDate":"2013-05-09 17:16:54","style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.
