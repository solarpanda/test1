It had a very mom and pop feel, and featured a look that was as traditional as it gets. Those who knew of it visited regularly, but the regulars were few. For many, the brewery was a thing shrouded in mystery... college students-which comprise a fair percentage of Ellensburg's population for most of the year-would occasionally see a bottle on a store shelf and ask where it came from. The likely response:\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, I think some dude makes that in his basement or something...\"\r\n\r\nThe word just wasn't getting out, and things didn't look good for the tiny brewery that made exceptionally tasty ales. \r\nWell, a couple of hoodlums in their late-twenties jumped on the opportunity to own and operate their own brewery, and what resulted is the Iron Horse Brewery you know and love today. They tweaked some recipes, changed some names, threw some ridiculous theme parties to encourage locals to actually see the brewery with their own eyes, and good things started to happen. Locals started to dig what the guys were doing. A few bars took a chance and put Iron Horse back on tap, and the beer started flowing. \r\n\r\nThe word started getting out.","website":"http:\/\/www.ironhorsebrewery.com\/","established":"2004","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ni4EnY\/upload_V7RJjR-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ni4EnY\/upload_V7RJjR-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ni4EnY\/upload_V7RJjR-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ni4EnY\/upload_V7RJjR-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ni4EnY\/upload_V7RJjR-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:04:41","locations":[{"id":"xZTJW3","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1000 Prospect Street","extendedAddress":"Suite 4","locality":"Ellensburg","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98926","phone":"509-933-3134","website":"http:\/\/www.ironhorsebrewery.com\/","latitude":46.9994703,"longitude":-120.5648701,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2004","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"6xSsrt","name":"Black IPA","nameDisplay":"Black IPA","abv":"7.9","ibu":"70","styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-11-11 19:27:31","updateDate":"2015-11-11 19:27:31","style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

Peter Egelston, Head Brewer in Northampton from 1987 until 1991, moved to Portsmouth to set up the new brewery here. (Egelston is now the sole proprietor of the Brewery.) \r\n\r\nThe brewing system consists of a custom made seven-barrel (210 gallons) JV Northwest brewhouse, two fourteen-barrel and three seven-barrel JV Northwest unitank (cylindroconical) fermenters, two fourteen-barrel horizontal fermenters (added later, in 1994), and twelve seven-barrel grundy cellar tanks. Originally, the Portsmouth Brewery opened with beer recipes from Northampton - Pale Ale, Old Brown Dog, Weizenheimer, Black Cat Stout, Blonde Ale, Golden and Amber Lagers - and these still comprise the core of the Brewery's full-time beers today. However, over the years, successive brewers have contributed many outstanding seasonal and specialty beers to the list.  All of the beers served at the Portsmouth Brewery are brewed right here on premise, with the exception of those beers, such as Shoals Pale Ale and Portsmouth Lager, brewed at Smuttynose Brewing Company, our sister company.","website":"http:\/\/www.portsmouthbrewery.com\/","established":"1991","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/4F7QA9\/upload_cq3hVs-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/4F7QA9\/upload_cq3hVs-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/4F7QA9\/upload_cq3hVs-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/4F7QA9\/upload_cq3hVs-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/4F7QA9\/upload_cq3hVs-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:55:06","locations":[{"id":"fKk5B1","name":"Main Brewpub","streetAddress":"56 Market Street","locality":"Portsmouth","region":"New Hampshire","postalCode":"03801","phone":"1-603-431-1115","website":"http:\/\/www.portsmouthbrewery.com\/","latitude":43.0780069,"longitude":-70.7575978,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1991","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2014-09-26 13:50:01","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"hp0dFa","name":"Black IPA","nameDisplay":"Black IPA","description":"Our Black IPA has a little something for everyone.

The horse of the dark nature holds the scales where the wheat and barley feedeth, not taketh from the mouths of man.

Now we love our IPAs, but it\u2019s downright comical the sheer volume of IPAs out there. There are White IPAs, Black IPAs, Brett IPAs, Oaked IPAs, blah blah blah, English IPAs, west coast IPAs, New England IPAs, blah blah blah, mango-jalapeno IPAs blah blah blah! At the 21A we take our beer very seriously but we don\u2019t take ourselves too seriously. We just want to have fun making great beers, and Blah Blah Blah IPA sure seemed like a good way to do it. Blah Blah Blah IPA is a maltier, amber-colored take of the traditional IPA. We incorporated some interesting malts including imported Baird Caramel 80, a darker, sweet crystal malt; Belgian biscuit malt to give it a toasty flavor; and German dark Munich malt for body and color. We also hopped this ale a bit differently than we normally do with most of the hops being added at different times very late in the boil for a full hop \"jammy\" flavor and bright aroma. We then dry-hopped it very agressively using five different hops including a newer experimental varietal to pack in flavors and aromas of pine, citrus, grapefruit and jam. Blah blah blah, just try it.

In 2008 we added six new 1500-barrel fermentation tanks that increased our capacity to 450,000 barrels per year, and added a new keg filling line capable of filling 300 kegs per hour.","website":"http:\/\/www.widmer.com\/","established":"1984","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/8wcv7h\/upload_61693P-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/8wcv7h\/upload_61693P-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/8wcv7h\/upload_61693P-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/8wcv7h\/upload_61693P-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/8wcv7h\/upload_61693P-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:13","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:02:38","locations":[{"id":"SgctbA","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"929 North Russell Street","locality":"Portland","region":"Oregon","postalCode":"97227","phone":"503-281-2437","website":"http:\/\/www.widmer.com\/","latitude":45.540795,"longitude":-122.675594,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1984","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:13","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"8ZBodz","name":"Blis Blast All Day IPA","nameDisplay":"Blis Blast All Day IPA","description":"All Day IPA aged for 5 months in BLiS Blast hot sauce barrels.","abv":"4.7","availableId":2,"styleId":30,"isOrganic":"Y","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-05-24 15:31:10","updateDate":"2015-09-02 14:52:39","available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content. The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.
