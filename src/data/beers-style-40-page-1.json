Brad Lincoln first experienced craft beer while working as an accountant in Portland, OR. The two met during the winter of 2009 while attending the Siebel Institute and studying brewing science. After being immersed in beer for the better part of five months, the two graduated and shared a desire to open a brewery. This resulted in the Saison-focused brewery that is now Funkwerks, opening December 9, 2010.\r\n \r\nSaisons originated as Belgian farmhouse ales- brewed during winter months for the farm workers during the summer months. Usually having a dry profile and complex fruity aromas, Saisons today are brewed year-round and generally have a higher alcohol percentage than their original versions.\r\n \r\nFunkwerks\u2019 two flagship beers, Saison and Tropic King, are produced year round. Also brewed annually are four seasonals, a number of small experimental batches, and select barrel-aged releases. Funkwerks flagship Saison was awarded a gold medal at the 2012 Great American Beer Festival (GABF) and a silver medal in 2011. Deceit, a Belgian-Style golden strong ale, was also awarded a gold medal at the GABF in 2012. In addition to receiving two gold medals in 2012, the GABF named Funkwerks the 2012 Small Brewing Company of the Year.\r\n \r\nFunkwerks is located at 1900 East Lincoln Avenue in Fort Collins, Colorado. The tasting room- complete with an indoor bar, retail area and spacious outdoor, dog-friendly patio- is open 7 days a week: Sunday through Thursday from 12pm-8pm; Friday and Saturday from 12pm-9pm.

There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"pzWq1r","name":"Jolly Pumpkin Artisan Ales","nameShortDisplay":"Jolly Pumpkin","description":"Welcome to a land of open fermentation, oak barrel aging, and bottle conditioning.

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and\/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and\/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and\/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and\/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and\/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:46:27"}},"breweries":[{"id":"noGtDY","name":"Bell's Brewery, Inc.","nameShortDisplay":"Bell's","description":"Bell's Brewery, Inc. began in 1985 with a quest for better beer and a 15 gallon soup kettle.
