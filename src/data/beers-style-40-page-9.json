The name Berlin is believed to be derived from a contraction of \"Burleigh Inn\", a tavern located at the crossroads of the Philadelphia Post Road (now South Main Street) and Sinepuxent Road (Tripoli Street).\r\n\r\nIt just so happens, that our building was originally a Cooperage - making oak barrels to fill with local produce and seafood to ship off to Baltimore in the early 1900's. And we are bringing barrels back to the building, aiding us in the aging of our hand-crafted ales.","website":"http:\/\/www.burleyoak.com\/","established":"2011","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/burleyoak.us8.list-manage.com\/subscribe?u=e9e9f1b229013eb1f9c176a6d&id=08ec5affe2","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:17:12","locations":[{"id":"dB9k9t","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"10016 Old Ocean City Blvd","locality":"Berlin","region":"Maryland","postalCode":"21811","phone":"410-422-8887","website":"http:\/\/www.burleyoak.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday 11am-11pm \r\nThursday, Friday, and Saturday 11am-2am\r\nSunday 12pm - 9pm","latitude":38.3338561,"longitude":-75.2169099,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"vSClW1","name":"Tart Golden","nameDisplay":"Tart Golden","description":"Bright and lemony, this tart experimental ale is the first step in building our sessionable sour beer.

Our beers are created with over 99% local Colorado ingredients. We ferment and age our beers in vintage oak barrels with a mixed culture of saccharomyces, brettanomyces and lactic acid bacteria. Time is one of the most important elements to us, as the barrel aging process creates flavors that are impossible to create any other way.  Our beers are unfiltered and 100% bottle conditioned.","website":"http:\/\/www.caseybrewing.com","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/J6OPsX\/upload_UrpdNM-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/J6OPsX\/upload_UrpdNM-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/J6OPsX\/upload_UrpdNM-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/J6OPsX\/upload_UrpdNM-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/J6OPsX\/upload_UrpdNM-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-01-04 02:32:50","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:03:03","locations":[{"id":"SlryVk","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"3421 Grand Avenue","locality":"Glenwood Springs","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"81601","phone":"(970) 230-9691","hoursOfOperation":"Since the majority of our beers are still aging, our brewery opening times will be extremely limited and sporadic.

We are an artisinal nano-brewery in the city of Carpinteria, CA that focuses on creating small batch beers with an experimental approach. Rob and Steve met in 1999 and brewed their first batch of beer together in 2008. While attending UCSB, Rob met Peter while visiting Orella Ranch in Gaviota and they began brewing beer together in the Santa Barbara area. Then, in the summer of 2011, the three of them converged for a backpacking trip (pictured above) on The Lost Coast of Northern California - it was on this trip that they first discussed starting a brewery together. In late 2012 after some serious brainstorming and long meetings, the initiative had begun and planning was underway.\r\n \r\nIt is vitally important to us that we are directly involved with the production of our raw materials.  We are growing our own hops in the Santa Barbara area to supplement our usage, and in the future we plan to be growing enough to supply hops to the local community.  Our grains will be grown in the Santa Ynez Valley and malted right here in Santa Barbara.  All of our solid waste (spent grains, hops, yeast) will be fed to local pigs, local cricket farmers, or composted .  We will participate in, and contribute to, local festivals and events that revolve around brewing, environmentalism, and the promotion of local businesses.","website":"http:\/\/www.brewlabcraft.com","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/DFJoPF\/upload_AttrGR-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/DFJoPF\/upload_AttrGR-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/DFJoPF\/upload_AttrGR-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/DFJoPF\/upload_AttrGR-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/DFJoPF\/upload_AttrGR-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-04-06 17:17:38","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:07:16","locations":[{"id":"9Hqlzg","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"4191-8 Carpinteria Ave.","locality":"Carpinteria","region":"California","postalCode":"93013","phone":"949.922.9152","hoursOfOperation":"Fri:  4:00pm - 9:00pm\nSat:  4:00pm - 9:00pm\nSun:  2:00pm - 7:00pm\n\n","latitude":34.4037704,"longitude":-119.5337568,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-04-07 19:22:22","updateDate":"2015-04-07 19:22:22","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"JvsvBX","name":"The Man Who Made Dessert","nameDisplay":"The Man Who Made Dessert","description":"Fermented entirely with Brettanomyces and aged on Turkish apricots.

Art co-founded one of the state's first microbreweries, Portland Brewing, as well as the Oregon Brewers Festival, which today is one of the world's preeminent craft beer festivals. \r\n\r\nCascade Brewmaster Ron Gansberg got his start in the Northwest wine industry. He crossed over in 1986 and began an eight-year career at BridgePort Brewing Co., where he honed his brewing skills, then moved on to the equipment and engineering side of the industry. As Engineering Manager at BridgePort, Ron directed the design and installation of the 80 bbl brewhouse that is still in operation. \r\n\r\nTogether, Art and Ron put their 40 years of beer experience to work, designing and installing Cascade's state-of-the-art 10 bbl brewing system in SW Portland, then creating and distributing well-balanced market-priced ales ranging from Pale Ale to Copper to Blond Bock. As the quality of the beer improved, they began to sell through distributors, increasing production to satisfy the wholesale market. \r\n\r\nCascade Brewery is situated in the Pacific Northwest, a region renowned for its craft beers - the Portland metropolitan area has 42 breweries, more than any other metro area in the US, and is the nation's largest craft brewing market. Even though there are an abundance of breweries in this area, it's highly competitive. To stand out amongst this group, you need to push the envelope and be out there to get to your niche and magic elixir.","website":"http:\/\/www.cascadebrewing.com\/","established":"1998","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/fF1DVj\/upload_S326LL-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/fF1DVj\/upload_S326LL-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/fF1DVj\/upload_S326LL-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/fF1DVj\/upload_S326LL-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/fF1DVj\/upload_S326LL-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:50","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:55:31","locations":[{"id":"lijo4X","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"7424 SW Beaverton Hillsdale Hwy.","locality":"Portland","region":"Oregon","postalCode":"97225","phone":"503-296-0110","website":"http:\/\/www.cascadebrewing.com\/","latitude":45.485627,"longitude":-122.753996,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1998","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:50","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"DnQkrw","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"939 SE Belmont","locality":"Portland","region":"Oregon","postalCode":"97214","latitude":45.5166668,"longitude":-122.6560412,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"restaurant","locationTypeDisplay":"Restaurant\/Ale House","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-07-04 05:03:47","updateDate":"2015-07-07 13:30:30","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"SW6AOm","name":"The Willows Family Ales","nameDisplay":"The Willows Family Ales","abv":"7","styleId":40,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-03 22:18:47","updateDate":"2014-03-03 22:18:47","style":{"id":40,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Sour Ale","shortName":"Sour","description":"American sour ales can be very light to black or take on the color of added fruits or other ingredients.

Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:28:32"},"breweries":[{"id":"erOQsC","name":"Gravity Brewlab","nameShortDisplay":"Gravity Brewlab","description":"The brainchild of owner Diego Ganoza, Gravity Brew Lab is designed to be the answer to the question Miami has been asking for the past several years: \"why can't we have creative, top quality, locally made craft beer; like most other metropolitan cities in the U.S.?\"\r\n\r\nOriginally, the concept was to open a really cool beer bar, bringing beer from around the United States and Belgium and making it available for the local enthusiasts to enjoy. However, we soon realized we were somewhat limited and constrained by which beers were actually available in the Miami market -due to distribution and other factors. And since we're all about unfettered drinking and out of the box thinking, the concept soon changed to: \"let's brew our own!\". This way we would be free to experiment with both well known and more obscure styles and experiment with flavor profiles and combinations. The possibilities, which once looked constrained, now appeared limitless.\r\n\r\nEnter Robert Tejon and Seth Hammond! After meeting and networking within Miami's local brewer community for the better part of a year, Diego met Robert and Seth. They decided to start making some test batches, which eventually led to making one-off pilot batches for nationally-renowned events (please see our \"events\" section). As momentum gathered, we realized that there was great potential in this concept and decided that the brewpub was definitely the way we wanted to go.\r\n\r\nAs Gravity Brew Lab, our mission is to bring you uncompromising, top quality beer. Our true purpose, though, is to give you a new experience every time you sit at one of our tables and ask for a glass of beer.","website":"http:\/\/www.gravitybrewlab.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/erOQsC\/upload_8FxTB5-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/erOQsC\/upload_8FxTB5-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/erOQsC\/upload_8FxTB5-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/erOQsC\/upload_8FxTB5-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/erOQsC\/upload_8FxTB5-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-09-15 22:43:22","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:16:33","locations":[{"id":"nOyUmq","name":"Brewery Restaurant","locality":"Miami","region":"Florida","postalCode":"33127","phone":"(786) 536-7085","website":"http:\/\/www.gravitybrewlab.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon 12pm - 12am\r\nTue 12pm - 12am\r\nWed 12pm - 12am\r\nThu 12pm - 12am\r\nFri 12pm - 4am\r\nSat 12pm - 4am\r\nSun 12pm - 4am","latitude":25.8105183,"longitude":-80.2042436,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-09-16 14:27:09","updateDate":"2015-09-16 16:19:29","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"k88qH4","name":"Truthful Statement","nameDisplay":"Truthful Statement","description":"This dark sour ale was inspired by classic Old Fashioned cocktails.
