Additions of lactobacillus have created a distinct tartness without a \u201cbarnyard\u201d character. The aroma is moderately intense with notes of Belgian yeast, light acidity, and apple skin. Flavor is moderately tart with integrated honey, green apple, and tannin.

For Jeff Lebesch would return to Fort Collins with a handful of ingredients and an imagination full of recipes. And then there was beer. Jeff's first two basement-brewed creations? A brown dubbel with earthy undertones named Abbey and a remarkably well-balanced amber he named Fat Tire. To say the rest was history would be to overlook his wife's involvement. Kim Jordan was New Belgium's first bottler, sales rep, distributor, marketer and financial planner.

We have been hard at work building this brewery keeping in mind sustainable practices and using local materials and craftsmen. We love our town of Berlin, Maryland and hope you join us in our taproom for a couple of pints and growlers. Our goal is to produce distinctive beers whose quaility is unsurpassed using new and traditional brewing methods.\r\n\r\nWhy \"Burley Oak?\"\r\n\r\nThe inspiration for our name Burley Oak Brewing Company was derived from the name of the town, our traditional brewing methods and the history of our brewhouse. \r\n\r\nBerlin, Maryland in Wikipedia \r\nThe town of Berlin had its start around the 1790s, part of the Burley Plantation, a 300-acre (1.2 km2) land grant dating back to 1677. The name Berlin is believed to be derived from a contraction of \"Burleigh Inn\", a tavern located at the crossroads of the Philadelphia Post Road (now South Main Street) and Sinepuxent Road (Tripoli Street).\r\n\r\nIt just so happens, that our building was originally a Cooperage - making oak barrels to fill with local produce and seafood to ship off to Baltimore in the early 1900's. And we are bringing barrels back to the building, aiding us in the aging of our hand-crafted ales.","website":"http:\/\/www.burleyoak.com\/","established":"2011","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/burleyoak.us8.list-manage.com\/subscribe?u=e9e9f1b229013eb1f9c176a6d&id=08ec5affe2","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:17:12","locations":[{"id":"dB9k9t","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"10016 Old Ocean City Blvd","locality":"Berlin","region":"Maryland","postalCode":"21811","phone":"410-422-8887","website":"http:\/\/www.burleyoak.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday 11am-11pm \r\nThursday, Friday, and Saturday 11am-2am\r\nSunday 12pm - 9pm","latitude":38.3338561,"longitude":-75.2169099,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"JvdNxs","name":"West Side","nameDisplay":"West Side","abv":"6.5","ibu":"40","styleId":70,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/JvdNxs\/upload_AcXYx6-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/JvdNxs\/upload_AcXYx6-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/JvdNxs\/upload_AcXYx6-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-23 18:08:37","updateDate":"2015-12-17 23:45:03","style":{"id":70,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Other Belgian-Style Ales","shortName":"Belgian Ale","description":"Recognizing the uniqueness and traditions of several other styles of Belgian Ales, the beers entered in this category will be assessed on the merits that they do not fit existing style guidelines and information that the brewer provides explaining the history and tradition of the style.

He has been fortunate to have experienced the wonderful beers that have historically defined many current craft beer styles.  As we pay homage to these great and historic beers, we\u2019ll add an American Flair that will be embraced in the Carolinas and beyond.","website":"http:\/\/www.nodabrewing.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/pcrctk\/upload_YHM8QJ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/pcrctk\/upload_YHM8QJ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/pcrctk\/upload_YHM8QJ-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/pcrctk\/upload_YHM8QJ-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/pcrctk\/upload_YHM8QJ-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:03","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:20:43","locations":[{"id":"oGBBGF","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2229 North Davidson St","locality":"Charlotte","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"28205","phone":"(704) 900-6851","website":"http:\/\/www.nodabrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday - 4 - 8:30\r\nTuesday - 4-8:30\r\nWednesday - 4-9\r\nThursday- 4-8:30\r\nFriday - 4-9:30\r\nSaturday - 12-10\r\nSunday - 1-6","latitude":35.240347,"longitude":-80.814842,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:03","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"sDsTCr","name":"Zwet.be","nameDisplay":"Zwet.be","abv":"7","glasswareId":5,"styleId":70,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/sDsTCr\/upload_bLwtHC-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/sDsTCr\/upload_bLwtHC-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/sDsTCr\/upload_bLwtHC-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:44:34","updateDate":"2015-12-16 11:31:20","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"style":{"id":70,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Other Belgian-Style Ales","shortName":"Belgian Ale","description":"Recognizing the uniqueness and traditions of several other styles of Belgian Ales, the beers entered in this category will be assessed on the merits that they do not fit existing style guidelines and information that the brewer provides explaining the history and tradition of the style.
