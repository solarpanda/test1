Soon he found himself president and heading up the Marin County State Fair competitions, and after burning out all the burners on the stove, he was banished to brewing outdoors.

These beers are designed by amateur brewers, and brewed at Beau\u2019s. The Bottle Imp was brewed in collaboration with David Thompson, winner of the 2012 Toronto Beer Week Homebrew Contest.\r\n\r\nThe Russian Imperial Stout style is brewed to weigh in high on alcohol, with the roasted, malty character typical of a stout. The style was first brewed in England in the 18th century, and exported to Russia for the pleasure of Czarina Catherine II and her court.\r\n\r\nThe Bottle Imp is a haunting turn-of-the-century tale by Robert Louis Stevenson about risking eternal damnation of the soul to have everything on earth one\u2019s heart desires. We suggest pairing the beer and the story on a cold night by a crackling fire.\r\n\r\nTasting Notes\r\n\r\nThe Bottle Imp is black, rich and malty, with a mouthfeel best described as liquid silk. The roasty dark malt character is complemented by fruit notes that suggest dates and figs, as well as subtle notes of black licorice. It is well-hopped to provide balance to the malts, keeping the residual sweetness in check. The coffee character is fully integrated, and a complement to the roast of the malts. The experience is rich and intense, with gentle alcohol warmth, and a long, complex finish.\r\nThe coffee infused into The Bottle Imp are a Mexican dark roast from Chiapas region (chocolate malt, toasted spice flavours) and a medium-roast Ethiopian Yirgacheffe (floral, berries, tropical fruit flavours), both roasted by Bridgehead in Ottawa.","abv":"9","ibu":"81","availableId":2,"styleId":16,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/kEMmNg\/upload_p7ueVd-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/kEMmNg\/upload_p7ueVd-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/kEMmNg\/upload_p7ueVd-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"Pumpernickel bread, trifle, dark chocolate fondue, coffee cake, grilled steak, truffle-oil-infused mashed potatoes, & sharp cheddar or stilton.","originalGravity":"1.088","createDate":"2015-03-01 19:25:39","updateDate":"2015-12-17 23:11:43","available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"style":{"id":16,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"British-Style Imperial Stout","shortName":"British Imperial Stout","description":"Dark copper to very dark brown, British-style imperial stouts typically have high alcohol content.
