We had always believed that if we were going to brew an IPA, that it better be extraordinary. Continuing a tradition from our home brewing roots, when neighbors and friends grew hops to contribute to our annual fresh-hopped IPA, we reached out to Richmond's very passionate beer community to invite home hop growers to donate some of their fresh harvest. Sure enough, they came through. With fresh hop contributions from local home growers, Hardywood RVA IPA captures the terroir of Richmond and the spirit of its hop growing beer enthusiasts. A wet-hopped, American-style India Pale Ale with loads of fresh local Columbus, Cascade, Chinook, Centennial and Glacier hops, Hardywood RVA IPA displays a toasted auburn color with a vibrant, creamy head. Cedar, citrus and herbal notes pervade the aroma, while the flavor offers a floral character and a delightful, resinous mouthfeel that can only be achieved with an assertive dose of freshly harvested hops. Medium- to full-bodied, Hardywood RVA IPA finishes with lingering hints of grapefruit and honey. While only 40 gallons of the inaugural RVA IPA were brewed on the pilot brewery in 2011, Hardywood plans to offer local gardeners free hop rhizomes each spring with educational materials on growing and harvesting hops, and the hope for a portion of their bounty at harvest time. We're hopeful that Hardywood RVA IPA will not only evolve as a unique annual beer offering, but as a fun, community building experience. Special thanks to our 2011 hop contributors: Sean Thomas-Pumphrey, Lindsay Weiford, Karl Elchinger, Nick Walthall and Taylor Chenery.","abv":"7","ibu":"62","styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/OPZ2jZ\/upload_8MdAHy-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/OPZ2jZ\/upload_8MdAHy-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/OPZ2jZ\/upload_8MdAHy-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"Hardywood RVA IPA is exceptional with pulled pork barbecue, smoked ribs, grilled venison loin, peppered steak, chili, and burgers.

He found the perfect spot in Charlottesville, VA \u2013 an historic storefront on Main Street that was once home to the state of Virginia\u2019s first craft brewing operation. In September 1999, Starr Hill Brewery was founded. Named after the local neighborhood, the brewery shared its space with the legendary Starr Hill Music Hall. Since then Starr Hill's delicious craft beers have become a favorite to visiting beer lovers, musicians, and music fans from around the world.\r\n\r\nIn response to the growing demand, Starr Hill moved from this small operation to a larger facility several miles outside of town in 2005. The brewery and tap room are still based in Crozet, nestled in the rolling foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Starr Hill's year-round, seasonal and limited-release brews are now enjoyed in bars, restaurants and music venues in the Mid Atlantic and Southeast and are also available at many grocery and convenience stores throughout the region. Among the most award-winning breweries on the East Coast, Starr Hill has won 21 Great American Beer Festival, World Beer Cup and Great British Beer Festival medals.\r\n\r\nLed by Brewmaster Robbie O'Cain, Starr Hill's team is striving to make creative and world-class beer every day.

Brock was a longtime homebrewer and had considered opening a brewery as far back as college, although that was quickly dismissed as a silly idea. Seven years after graduating, Brock revisited the idea, enlisted Kevin's help and the brewery was off and running. Kevin has since left the business after a bitter battle.

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures.

Erika and Jeff were friends in early college years who found each other later, dated, got married, started a family, then asked each other, \u201cWhat do you really want to do in life\u2026(when you grow up)?\u201d  They liked beer, liked making beer, liked having a good time, and liked sharing their likes with others.\r\n\r\nTheir first homebrew settings were humble: Jeff\u2019s nose sticking deep into a carboy of fermenting beer in a friend's small apartment.\r\n\r\nThey evolved from the stove top with extract batches, to setting up a small, all-grain batch brewery (8 gallon kettles - Thanksgiving turkey frying pots -  on propane burners with converted coolers for mash tuns) on the back porch,  to bigger and bigger goals.  From a 5 gallon pot on the stove (with a batch of extract syrup), to a 10 gallon converted cooler (with cracked grain), and kegs turned to kettles, to working on a 15 barrel brewery creating batches that go state to state, national, international...  They made batches at home for themselves, their friends, for weddings, parties, etc..  and realized this is what they wanted to do for a job.   Jeff apprenticed with a professional brewer (local celebrity Skip Madsen of Pike, Boundary Bay, American, etc\u2026) and learned the pro angle of the trade.   They have seen the evolution, gone through it, appreciate it, and are happy to be where they are today.\r\n\r\nSalish Sea Brewing Co. is a 10 bbl (310 gallon per batch) establishment.  We hope to brew twice a week, offering a variety of ales and the occasional lager and pilsner. \r\n\r\nJeff and Erika have a  6-year-old little girl and a 2-year-old son.  They are family oriented and hope for the brewery to be family approachable.   Families are welcome, but this is a brewery with a tasting room, not a playground (we do not cater to children).  Please respect our space and the space of others.  Minors must be accompanied by an adult. \r\n\r\nOur roots are solid, our goals are lofty, but our dreams, aspirations, and hopes are high.  We want to create a place to showpiece our beers, invite your friends and families, and for you all to have a great time.\r\n\r\nThe Salish Sea Brewing Company is the real deal!\r\n\r\nWe have three 10bbl fermenters in place, the 10bbl bright tank, kettle, and mash up and running!  Please join us for a beer soon.","website":"http:\/\/salishbrewing.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/s2QjsH\/upload_H7IgFv-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/s2QjsH\/upload_H7IgFv-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/s2QjsH\/upload_H7IgFv-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/s2QjsH\/upload_H7IgFv-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/s2QjsH\/upload_H7IgFv-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-23 04:28:07","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:59:19","locations":[{"id":"RDG0mx","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"518 Dayton Street","extendedAddress":"Suite 104","locality":"Edmonds","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98020","phone":"425-582-8474","hoursOfOperation":"Wed:  3:00pm - 10:00pm\nThu:  3:00pm - 10:00pm\nFri:  12:00pm - 11:00pm\nSat:  12:00pm - 11:00pm\nSun:  12:00pm - 8:00pm\n\nClosed on Mondays.","latitude":47.8096929,"longitude":-122.3767578,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-24 13:41:23","updateDate":"2014-09-24 13:41:23","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
