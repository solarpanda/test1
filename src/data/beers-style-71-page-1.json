Working with the unique flavors of Dandelion\u2019s single-source beans, we created this decadent beer by layering in smoked and dark-roasted malts with citrusy Ivanhoe hops from Clearlake, CA. Finally, we added a blend of hand-roasted cocoa beans sourced from Madagascar and R\u00edo Caribe, Venezuela. The Madagascar beans add bright berry-cocoa flavors, while the R\u00edo Caribe adds dark chocolate and bourbon notes.

To recreate this regional specialty, we imported all of the ingredients from the countries that birthed the style. The end result is a malt-forward amber with deep hints of caramel and candied apple. Eight different specialty malts come together to yield a magnificently complex malt profile. The French Strisselspalt hops used for aroma create a mildly spicy and floral bouquet. The unique yeast strain combined with warm fermentation and an extended cold-conditioning period produce a smooth and drinkable ale reminiscent of a lager but with full flavored ale fruitiness.","abv":"6.8","ibu":"20","glasswareId":8,"srmId":9,"availableId":4,"styleId":71,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/ioZMgs\/upload_LePFSA-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/ioZMgs\/upload_LePFSA-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/ioZMgs\/upload_LePFSA-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","servingTemperature":"cool","servingTemperatureDisplay":"Cool - (8-12C\/45-54F)","originalGravity":"1.0614","createDate":"2015-07-01 12:44:21","updateDate":"2016-06-01 01:56:09","glass":{"id":8,"name":"Tulip","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"srm":{"id":9,"name":"9","hex":"E58500"},"available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":71,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"French-Style Bi\u00e8re de Garde","shortName":"Bi\u00e8re de Garde","description":"Beers in this category are golden to deep copper or light brown in color.

A brown dubbel with earthy undertones named Abbey and a remarkably well-balanced amber he named Fat Tire. To say the rest was history would be to overlook his wife's involvement.

The first \u2018brassin\u2019 (brewing mix) of LA CHOUFFE (49 litres) was finished on 27th August 1982.\r\n\r\nThe elves of Achouffe were impatient to discover new countries, and their Dutch cousins were the first to give them a warm welcome. Even today, the Netherlands is the major destination of Achouffe Beers outside Belgium. Nowadays, more than 20 countries worldwide are supplied with our \u2018nectar\u2019 from the Ardennes forests. Coveted international awards have also been received year after year to reward their unique taste.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the summer of 2006 the founders of the Brewery chose to entrust the future of their dear elves to the Duvel Moortgat Brewery. The group\u2019s wish is to invest in Achouffe and to develop the full potential of the Brewery.","website":"http:\/\/www.achouffe.be\/","established":"1982","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/D7h5Pj\/upload_FQiv77-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/D7h5Pj\/upload_FQiv77-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/D7h5Pj\/upload_FQiv77-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/D7h5Pj\/upload_FQiv77-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/D7h5Pj\/upload_FQiv77-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:40:32","locations":[{"id":"QYiAND","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Achouffe 32","region":"Houffalize","postalCode":"6666","phone":"32-061-28-81-47","website":"http:\/\/www.achouffe.be\/","latitude":50.16569,"longitude":5.720881,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"BE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"BE","name":"BELGIUM","displayName":"Belgium","isoThree":"BEL","numberCode":56,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"wL53mb","name":"Bi\u00e8re de Mars","nameDisplay":"Bi\u00e8re de Mars","description":"An old farmhouse style \"March beer\" from the Alsace region.
