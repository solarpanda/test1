It progressed to the inevitable challenge of making our own home brew versions of the shared beers we loved and with the donation of our first brewing equipment from a friend, we started our beer making journey about 18 years ago.  From the beginning, we both found common ground having similar tastes in beer styles which progressed to a shared obsession of trying to figure out how our favorites were made.  We both shared in the fun of sharing our results with friends and watching their reactions, which kept us motivated to make more.  Now, I think we play to each other\u0080\u0099s strengths.  Mike is excited about the technical part of brewing and Greg enjoys determining flavor combinations and fun new things to try.

Customers developed the habit of asking for them by the tax ratings, or shilling names. The 80-shilling style was one of the stronger types that could be purchased, containing 4.0-5.5% alcohol. The 80-shilling beers are traditionally malty, without much hop character, as hops did not grow in Scotland and were expensive to import.\r\n\r\nTartan Ale has a deep, copper-color and is produced in the 80-shilling style.

It progressed to the inevitable challenge of making our own home brew versions of the shared beers we loved and with the donation of our first brewing equipment from a friend, we started our beer making journey about 18 years ago.  From the beginning, we both found common ground having similar tastes in beer styles which progressed to a shared obsession of trying to figure out how our favorites were made.  We both shared in the fun of sharing our results with friends and watching their reactions, which kept us motivated to make more.  Now, I think we play to each other\u0080\u0099s strengths.  Mike is excited about the technical part of brewing and Greg enjoys determining flavor combinations and fun new things to try.

Founded in January, 2000 by Fran and Tony Caradonna, the O'Fallon Brewery currently employs eight full-time. In 2009 we brewed around 4,100 barrels of beer...equivalent to about 57,000 cases.","website":"http:\/\/www.ofallonbrewery.com\/","established":"2000","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/3vnQcO\/upload_fWpBe9-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/3vnQcO\/upload_fWpBe9-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/3vnQcO\/upload_fWpBe9-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/3vnQcO\/upload_fWpBe9-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/3vnQcO\/upload_fWpBe9-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:04","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:53:28","locations":[{"id":"y7aFyk","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"26 West Industrial Drive","locality":"O'Fallon","region":"Missouri","postalCode":"63366","phone":"636-474-2337","website":"http:\/\/www.ofallonbrewery.com\/","latitude":38.806087,"longitude":-90.753188,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2000","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:04","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"NqGHEP","name":"Wee Heavy","nameDisplay":"Wee Heavy","styleId":8,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/NqGHEP\/upload_4iPgLY-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/NqGHEP\/upload_4iPgLY-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/NqGHEP\/upload_4iPgLY-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-11-26 12:36:02","updateDate":"2015-12-17 07:35:52","style":{"id":8,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Scottish-Style Heavy Ale","shortName":"Scottish Heavy","description":"Scottish heavy ale is moderate in strength and dominated by a smooth, sweet maltiness balanced with low, but perceptible, hop bitterness.

Rogue's first brewpub was located in Ashland, Oregon and was a 10bbl brewsystem. Rogue opened a second brewpub, 15bbl brewsystem, in May 1989 located in Newport, Oregon. Rogue closed its Ashland operation in 1997, after the great flood destroyed the place. In 1991, the 15bbl system, named Howard after John Maier's former boss, from the Newport brewpub was transferred across the bay to the current brewery and upgraded to a 30bbl system. In 1998 Rogue bought a 50bbl brewsystem, named Kobe. Kobe is the only brewsystem in use. Tours: We offer brewery tours every day at 3 pm (followed by a distillery tour at 4pm). Go up to the bar inside the brewery (Brewers on the Bay) and check in with the bartender and the tour will commence.
