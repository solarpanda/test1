Shirts, glasses, stickers, and growlers will be available for purchase in the brewery","website":"http:\/\/bricksidebrewery.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/O7hh8Y\/upload_auHSod-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/O7hh8Y\/upload_auHSod-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/O7hh8Y\/upload_auHSod-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/O7hh8Y\/upload_auHSod-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/O7hh8Y\/upload_auHSod-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-01-25 11:57:27","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:40:33","locations":[{"id":"i9pq7J","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"64 Gratiot St.","locality":"Copper Harbor","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49918","phone":"(906) 289-4772","website":"http:\/\/bricksidebrewery.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Thu: 4:00 pm - 10:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 4:00 pm - 11:00 pm\r\nSun: 4:00 pm - 10:00 pm","latitude":47.4677795,"longitude":-87.8876068,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-01-25 11:58:04","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"rBTacX","name":"Railyard Ale","nameDisplay":"Railyard Ale","styleId":37,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:44:02","updateDate":"2012-03-22 13:04:51","style":{"id":37,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Brown Ale","shortName":"American Brown","description":"American brown ales range from deep copper to brown in color.

This milestone not only exemplifies their continuing commitment to amazing craft beer, but also signals a shift in focus for the brewery towards more innovative recipes and concepts.\r\n\r\nHeaded up by a small group of impassioned beer lovers including head brewer Garett Lockhart, Red Brick is determined to lead the charge in the south, putting out excellent beers such as \"Hoplanta\" IPA and the upcoming winter release \"Sacred Cow\" chai milk stout. They also take time to push the limits of brewing with the \"Brick Mason\" series, which the staff sees as their continuing masterpiece. Highlights from this series include \"The Lost Years\" old ale, \"Black-Eye Rye\" American black ale, and the most recent release \"20th Anniversary\", a 10% Imperial stout that was aged in Buffalo Trace bourbon barrels. Early accolades have already compared it to the hallowed KBS.\r\n\r\nThe future keeps looking brighter and brighter for this brewery, and the next couple years will see them growing and experimenting with diverse styles, collaborating with fellow breweries, implementing a new barrel program, and continuing to raise the bar for themselves in all aspects. After all, craft beer isn't just a product; it's a journey.","website":"http:\/\/www.redbrickbrewing.com\/","established":"1993","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/11gqIZ\/upload_kE3Udx-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/11gqIZ\/upload_kE3Udx-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/11gqIZ\/upload_kE3Udx-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/11gqIZ\/upload_kE3Udx-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/11gqIZ\/upload_kE3Udx-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:05:16","locations":[{"id":"QC2xF6","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2323 Defoor Hills Road","locality":"Atlanta","region":"Georgia","postalCode":"30318","phone":"404-355-5558","website":"http:\/\/www.redbrickbrewing.com\/","latitude":33.818002,"longitude":-84.435253,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1993","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"BsrcIn","name":"Red Flannel Ale","nameDisplay":"Red Flannel Ale","description":"Red flannels keep you warm and so will this hearty ale.

His great grandparents were bootleggers in Detroit, running booze from Canada, who also ran a blind pig speakeasy out of their basement. Detroit police (including the Chief) were their main clientele. His great grandmother also made beer in her kitchen for the guys at the brickyard where she worked.\r\n\r\nNathan's grandfather Cecil -- rail worker, 17-year Ford employee turned weird angry recluse -- left Detroit for Hillsdale, MI to start farming. Cecil started brewing in the early 80's, naming beers after the things that inspired the recipes and included ingredients he grew or foraged. \r\n\r\nAfter some frustration with trying to break into brewing, Nathan started Bitter Old Fecker, working under Cecil as an apprentice. During the start up process, Nathan took a job as an assistant brewer at Grizzly Peak, leaving after 18 months to focus efforts on Bitter Old Fecker exclusively. \r\n\r\nNathan and Cecil produce high gravity, bold beers brewed in a \"rustic\" style. No automatic equipment. Kettles, mash tuns, etc., stirred by hand in a brewery that can literally produce beer without the use of electricity. All beers are barrel-aged and include non traditional, foraged and locally sourced ingredients. All malt and hops are 100% US grown. His first brew, introduced in the Summer of 2013, is called Strutter, named after a nasty old rooster on Cecil's farm. Darlin', Kaplan, and Jet are brews that are soon to follow.","website":"http:\/\/drinkoldfecker.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/UzzM9h\/upload_ja9bTt-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/UzzM9h\/upload_ja9bTt-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/UzzM9h\/upload_ja9bTt-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/UzzM9h\/upload_ja9bTt-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/UzzM9h\/upload_ja9bTt-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-09-10 15:33:15","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:16:15","locations":[{"id":"SMLKXz","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"12855 E Old US Hwy 12","locality":"Chelsea","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"48118","phone":"(734) 444-5201","website":"drinkoldfecker.com","latitude":42.2986065,"longitude":-83.9821194,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-09-10 15:44:43","updateDate":"2015-09-10 15:44:43","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"IZTISJ","name":"Rio Lodo","nameDisplay":"Rio Lodo","description":"Thick and rich milk chocolate meets silky caramel and a firm bitterness in this delicious American brown ale. 5.5% ABV","abv":"5.5","glasswareId":5,"availableId":1,"styleId":37,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/IZTISJ\/upload_V15Uqr-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/IZTISJ\/upload_V15Uqr-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/IZTISJ\/upload_V15Uqr-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:44:05","updateDate":"2015-12-16 08:28:19","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":37,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Brown Ale","shortName":"American Brown","description":"American brown ales range from deep copper to brown in color.

This year, expect Yorkshire\u2019s finest to craft flavour and fun into some of the best beer you\u2019ll try this summer.","website":"http:\/\/www.magicrockbrewing.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/8QPpzE\/upload_LzTASA-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/8QPpzE\/upload_LzTASA-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/8QPpzE\/upload_LzTASA-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/8QPpzE\/upload_LzTASA-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/8QPpzE\/upload_LzTASA-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-12-13 23:56:41","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:02:20","locations":[{"id":"82Ynoe","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Quarmby Mills Tanyard Road","locality":"Huddersfield HD3","postalCode":"4YP","latitude":53.6533435,"longitude":-1.8280275,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"GB","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-01-20 19:57:52","updateDate":"2015-01-20 19:58:09","country":{"isoCode":"GB","name":"UNITED KINGDOM","displayName":"United Kingdom","isoThree":"GBR","numberCode":826,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"YHDefj","name":"Rock'n Blond","nameDisplay":"Rock'n Blond","description":"Have you ever been sitting at the Beach and that hot Blonde(Guy or Girl) with the rockin' body came running down the beach?

Rogue's first brewpub was located in Ashland, Oregon and was a 10bbl brewsystem. Rogue opened a second brewpub, 15bbl brewsystem, in May 1989 located in Newport, Oregon. Rogue closed its Ashland operation in 1997, after the great flood destroyed the place. In 1991, the 15bbl system, named Howard after John Maier's former boss, from the Newport brewpub was transferred across the bay to the current brewery and upgraded to a 30bbl system. In 1998 Rogue bought a 50bbl brewsystem, named Kobe. Kobe is the only brewsystem in use. Tours: We offer brewery tours every day at 3 pm (followed by a distillery tour at 4pm). Go up to the bar inside the brewery (Brewers on the Bay) and check in with the bartender and the tour will commence. Please call ahead if you have a large group and or to verify the tour time...Brewer's on the Bay phone is 541-867-3664.

Rogue's first brewpub was located in Ashland, Oregon and was a 10bbl brewsystem. Rogue opened a second brewpub, 15bbl brewsystem, in May 1989 located in Newport, Oregon. Rogue closed its Ashland operation in 1997, after the great flood destroyed the place. In 1991, the 15bbl system, named Howard after John Maier's former boss, from the Newport brewpub was transferred across the bay to the current brewery and upgraded to a 30bbl system. In 1998 Rogue bought a 50bbl brewsystem, named Kobe. Kobe is the only brewsystem in use. Tours: We offer brewery tours every day at 3 pm (followed by a distillery tour at 4pm). Go up to the bar inside the brewery (Brewers on the Bay) and check in with the bartender and the tour will commence. Please call ahead if you have a large group and or to verify the tour time...Brewer's on the Bay phone is 541-867-3664. The view from Brewers on the Bay includes the marina (outside), and the bottling line and brew kettles

Since then, the Central PA natives have been handcrafting world-class beers that blend traditional brewing techniques with the innovation and eclecticism of the American craft brewing movement. Today, the Hershey, PA-based brewery produces six year-round beers (Hopback Amber Ale, Troegenator Double Bock, JavaHead Stout, Tr\u00f6egs Pale Ale, DreamWeaver Wheat, and Perpetual IPA); four seasonal releases as part of the Hop Cycle series (Cultivator Helles Bock, Sunshine Pils, Hop Knife Harvest Ale, and Blizzard of Hops Winter IPA); and two limited beers (Nugget Nectar and Mad Elf Ale). \r\n\r\nIn addition to these beers, Tr\u00f6egs produces a variety of experimental, small batch beers as part of its Scratch Beer Series. These beers are available exclusively at the brewery and most are draft-only limited releases, although some popular Scratch Beers (Fresh Hop Ale, Fest Lager, etc.) are bottled for release through the General Store at the brewery. \r\n\r\nIn late 2013, Tr\u00f6egs introduced a special line of cork & cage bottle releases. The first, LaGrave, is available year-round. Master of Pumpkins was also released in 2013 and will continue with availability in the fall. Other beers such as Jovial have since followed suit. The addition of a canning line not only offers the brewery more flexibility in the way it presents its beers, but also allows Tr\u00f6egs to provide customers with more packaging options. To date, Tr\u00f6egs has released Perpetual IPA and Sunshine Pils in 12-ounce cans and Troegenator in 16-ounce cans. Plans to release other seasonal and limited beers in cans are currently in the works. \r\n\r\nThe Splinter Series is an extremely limited line of barrel-aged beers packaged in cork & cage bottles. While only a handful of these beers have been produced, Tr\u00f6egs plans to expand this series with the inclusion of Nebulous (barrel-aged LaGrave with Brett), bourbon barrel-aged Troegenator, and others. \r\n\r\nTr\u00f6egs currently distributes its beers throughout Delaware, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Washington D.C. In addition, Tr\u00f6egs plans to expand into other New England markets in 2015.\r\n\r\nOur state-of-the-art facility gives visitors a glimpse into the workings of a full production brewery by offering both guided tasting and self-guided tours. Our Tasting Room provides ample seating with views of the brewhouse, where you can sit back and enjoy one of our six year-round beers as well as a variety of seasonal and small-batch experimental brews. \r\n\r\nOur Snack Bar reflects our constant desire to explore, discover and share by focusing on fresh, simple fare that is locally sourced and house-made. With that in mind, we feature a seasonally rotating menu with daily chef\u2019s specials.\r\n\r\nwww.troegs.com","website":"http:\/\/www.troegs.com\/","established":"1997","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/www.troegs.com\/about_us\/newsletter.aspx","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_d9lSk3-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_d9lSk3-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_d9lSk3-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_d9lSk3-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_d9lSk3-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:01:05","locations":[{"id":"C6iHOv","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"200 E Hersheypark Dr","locality":"Hershey","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"17033","phone":"717-232-1297","website":"http:\/\/www.troegs.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sun:  11:00am - 9:00pm\nThu:  11:00am - 10:00pm\nFri:  11:00am - 10:00pm\nSat:  11:00am - 10:00pm\n\nGeneral Store Hours\r\n------------------------------\r\nSunday: 11am to 5pm\r\nMonday - Saturday: 11am to 8pm","latitude":40.2972852,"longitude":-76.6428527,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1997","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2015-04-24 16:00:33","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"G39tFE","name":"Rum Barrel Aged 4-Elf Winter Warmer","nameDisplay":"Rum Barrel Aged 4-Elf Winter Warmer","abv":"9","styleId":37,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-12-01 15:36:42","updateDate":"2015-12-01 15:36:43","style":{"id":37,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Brown Ale","shortName":"American Brown","description":"American brown ales range from deep copper to brown in color.
