The origin of the name \"South Ridge\" came from Wally, Kristy's late father, who was a famous Boulder golf coach (he coached Hale Irwin in high school).  In those days, Wally used to bring his golfers up here and they practiced driving by hitting balls up the South Ridge - hence the \"fairway.\"  The label is purposely made using a little tongue-in-cheek because Wally was a guy who liked his students to enjoy learning.

The idea of opening a brewery came to us in the spring of 2007, when we were both working as cooks in Spokane. At the time we were 18 and 21 years old. One spring day, we made the decision to quit our jobs and start a brewery. Shortly after that, we bought our first homebrew kit and brewed our first few batches. We knew that this is what we wanted to do with our lives. Our family encouraged us and helped us gather enough equipment to open our brewery. We became licensed to sell beer in Washington in January of 2010. We opened our new location and taproom at 2018 E Riverside Ave, Suite #1 in Spokane in May of 2011. We take pride in brewing quality beers made with the freshest ingredients around. All of our brews also contain a special touch of \u201cBudge Bros Magic\u201d. We have many exciting plans for the future, including an exclusive \u201cPlastic Cup Club\u201d, special events at the Taproom, seasonal brews, and cool new merchandise. We also serve the best Popcorn in the Greater Spokane Area.\r\n\r\nWhile you\u2019re here, feel free to poke around and check out the types of beer we brew. Don\u2019t be afraid to take a look at us and see some of our videos, photos, and games created for your enjoyment.

Both had an entrepanerial passion, but never thought of a microbrewery as their business.  \"The decision was made for us.  Make a business out of something you love to do and you will never work another day in your life\" the couple states.  A lot of hard work and a love for good beer motivates the business. \r\nWe decided to open Eastern Shore Brewing after talking with friends from St. Michael's Winery, and were told that the town was in need of a microbrewery.  After some discussion (less than you may think), we agreed and were on our way.  With some trials along the way in year one, year two proved to be the pinicle of change.  An increase in brewery size promoted an increase of staff.  Randall Marquis came on board as brewmaster in March of 2009 and has made his presence known.  An undergratudate of Franklin Marshall College, and a brewing certificate holder from UC Davis, Randy is a large portion of the success of Eastern Shore Brewing.  Three beers took home medals in the Maryland Govenor's cup competition (Bronze for Lighthause Golden Ale, Silver for the Duck Duck Goose Porter and a Silver for the St.ichael's Amber ALe) on October 9th.  And although happy with the medals, Eastern Shore Brewing's goals are to continue to grow the busines and improve their products.  Distribution ranges from Cambridge to Kent Island on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, and recently moved into Ellicott City, Maryland.  A new fermenter will be arriving shortly after the new year, which will increase capacity even further.\r\nThere is more to come....","website":"http:\/\/www.easternshorebrewing.com\/","established":"2008","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/njjqaj\/upload_ZGz3Ti-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/njjqaj\/upload_ZGz3Ti-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/njjqaj\/upload_ZGz3Ti-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/njjqaj\/upload_ZGz3Ti-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/njjqaj\/upload_ZGz3Ti-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:45:05","locations":[{"id":"wW6rQJ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"605 S.

Our brewing process utilizes the traditional English method of upward infusion mashing in our combination mash lauter tun to create lagers and ales inspired by old world values, but with modern quality and consistency. The staff at The Lion Brewery is dedicated to producing true handcrafted beers, made right here in our century-old Brewhouse. All of our premium beers are made using only the four basic ingredients allowed by the Reinheitsgebot, or German purity law. Under the skillful supervision of our Master Brewer, Leo Orlandini, each of our lagers and ales are brewed in small batches using only the finest hops and malts available to guarantee the highest quality and freshness. Each product we brew is an original recipe especially created to deliver a fuller flavor than ordinary beers, yet with an approachable style and character. As a result, our beers have garnered numerous medals from the Great American Beer Festival and the World Beer Championships in recent years.\r\n\r\nIn 1974 the Lion Brewing Company bought the Stegmaier Brand.","website":"http:\/\/www.lionbrewery.com\/","established":"1857","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TwOeWu\/upload_VQOP01-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TwOeWu\/upload_VQOP01-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TwOeWu\/upload_VQOP01-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TwOeWu\/upload_VQOP01-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TwOeWu\/upload_VQOP01-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:00","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:50:50","locations":[{"id":"z0gnmN","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"700 North Pennsylvania Blvd.","locality":"Wilkes Barre","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"18705","phone":"800-233-8327","website":"http:\/\/www.lionbrewery.com\/","latitude":41.2556575,"longitude":-75.858261,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1857","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:00","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"ZddHOx","name":"Stepchild Red","nameDisplay":"Stepchild Red","abv":"6.1","ibu":"80","styleId":32,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/ZddHOx\/upload_8RnOlp-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/ZddHOx\/upload_8RnOlp-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/ZddHOx\/upload_8RnOlp-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-04-15 04:17:10","updateDate":"2015-12-18 02:02:16","style":{"id":32,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Amber\/Red Ale","shortName":"Amber","description":"American amber\/red ales range from light copper to light brown in color.

This facility will be capable of producing up to 100,000 barrels per year, in stark contrast to the system in Springfield, that is maxed out at about 4000 barrels produced in 2012.\r\nOur state of the art equipment and the facility are all built with every opportunity toward a green foot print, including the most efficient lighting, boiler, solar heating, etc.. available today.\r\nThe new facility has a large tasting room and outdoor patio and also has limited food service, to allow customers to enjoy all of our craft brews in a very comfortable setting, and with enough parking and outdoor area to support large parties!","website":"http:\/\/www.hopvalleybrewing.com\/","established":"2009","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/8IJKF0\/upload_DhZACn-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/8IJKF0\/upload_DhZACn-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/8IJKF0\/upload_DhZACn-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/8IJKF0\/upload_DhZACn-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/8IJKF0\/upload_DhZACn-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:15:36","locations":[{"id":"dqfA53","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"980 Kruse Way","locality":"Springfield","region":"Oregon","postalCode":"97477","phone":"(541) 744-3330","website":"http:\/\/www.hopvalleybrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Thu: 11:00 am - 11:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:00 am - 1:00 am\r\nSun: 11:00 am - 11:00 pm","latitude":44.082956,"longitude":-123.039863,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2009","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"OTt7Vx","name":"Hop Valley Brewing Co.","streetAddress":"990 W.1st Ave","locality":"Eugene","region":"Oregon","postalCode":"97402","phone":"541-485-2337","website":"http:\/\/www.hopvalleybrewing.com","hoursOfOperation":"11:30am-10:00pm Sunday-Wednesday\r\n11:30am-11:00pm Thursday-Saturday","latitude":44.05819,"longitude":-123.107531,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-13 00:51:08","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"7V7KGU","name":"Steve\u2019s Backyard Red","nameDisplay":"Steve\u2019s Backyard Red","description":"Our first collaboration brewed at Lawson\u2019s Finest in Warren, VT features a local homebrewer, Steve Robbins, with this talented use of specialty malts, a fine blend of hops and a generous dose of Green Mountain attitude.","abv":"5.5","styleId":32,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/7V7KGU\/upload_LF1oUN-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/7V7KGU\/upload_LF1oUN-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/7V7KGU\/upload_LF1oUN-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-18 19:04:07","updateDate":"2015-12-17 22:47:25","style":{"id":32,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Amber\/Red Ale","shortName":"Amber","description":"American amber\/red ales range from light copper to light brown in color.

While the name of the company remains Clipper City Brewing Company, all of its beer falls under the Heavy Seas brand. Heavy Seas is located at 4615 Hollins Ferry Road, Suite B, in the Halethorpe section of Baltimore. Heavy Seas currently offers a variety of beer styles in approx. 18 states within the United States.\r\n\r\nHeavy Seas mission is to bring back the local brewery, and to do it in such a way that we are more than just a fringe player, but a positive part of our area.
