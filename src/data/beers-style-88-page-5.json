The use of a lager yeast and a much cooler fermentation temperature (48 \u2013 50 degrees F) is the main difference between this beer and an ale. This cooler fermentation results in a beer with less fruity flavor than an ale fermented at 65 \u2013 68 degrees F. For that authentic bock profile, To Hell n\u2019 Bock is crafted with lots of Munich malt. This grain has a toasty, bread -like aroma that imparts a delicious malty flavor to complement the fresh German hops.","glasswareId":5,"availableId":4,"styleId":88,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/oU0Yfl\/upload_AuUbcq-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/oU0Yfl\/upload_AuUbcq-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/oU0Yfl\/upload_AuUbcq-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:44:23","updateDate":"2015-12-16 09:00:24","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":88,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Traditional German-Style Bock","shortName":"Bock","description":"Traditional bocks are made with all malt and are strong, malty, medium- to full-bodied, bottom-fermented beers with moderate hop bitterness that should increase proportionately with the starting gravity.

Ayinger beers have been frequent award winners in international beer competitions.\r\n\r\nFor some years, a range of beer was brewed under the Ayingerbrau name by Samuel Smith's Brewery in Tadcaster, United Kingdom. Although the Ayinger logo was used, the recipes and range were different from those of the Ayinger Brewery. The arrangement ended in spring 2006, at which point Samuel Smith's rebranded the beers. Distribution of the Ayinger range of beer followed that summer. Because the Oktoberfest in Munich does not allow breweries outside its city limits to participate, Ayinger Brewery organizes many smaller festivals in the countryside around Munich.","website":"http:\/\/en.ayinger-bier.de\/","established":"1878","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QKdFk2\/upload_jjUvnX-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QKdFk2\/upload_jjUvnX-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QKdFk2\/upload_jjUvnX-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QKdFk2\/upload_jjUvnX-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QKdFk2\/upload_jjUvnX-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-28 16:51:35","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:36:51","locations":[{"id":"eqCbpj","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"M\u00fcnchner Stra\u00dfe 21","region":"Aying","postalCode":"D-85653","phone":"49080958890","isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-10-07 20:47:32","updateDate":"2014-10-07 20:47:32","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"TpEQbU","name":"WinterBock","nameDisplay":"WinterBock","description":"WinterBock is a strong, dark beer that was used by eleventh century Bavarian monks to help sustain themselves during winter fasts.
