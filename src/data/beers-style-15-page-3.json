Three Rivers believes in preserving their historical heritage of downtown Farmington. The restaurant was expanded in July, 1999. The addition includes an outdoor private patio, a bar, and the largest beer label and beer coaster collections in New Mexico.

From the Days in the basement of Jamie\u2019s Hudson Valley home, to brewing over 600 barrels in the first year at MHBC, the two have continually focused on creating beers that are not only seasonally varied, but have classic integrity. An American Brewers Guild graduate in 2014, Mill House Brewing Company continually strives to create better beer, with in-house lab testing, water recipes, and house yeast strain cultivation.  They are true masters of their craft, brewing 25 uniquely different beers to date, with many more on the way!\r\nMill House Brewing Company has enjoyed much success since 2013.  The Brewpub was awarded Top 100 Hot Spots in American from OpenTable dining, Hudson Valley Magazine Best New Restaurant and Bar Menu, Hudson River Craft Brew Fest \u201cPeople\u2019s Choice\u201d in 2013\/2014, as well as countless other accolades.

A better product that not only tastes great, but is also made in a responsible and sustainable way. We use 100% organic 2-Row in all of our beers and each of our beers is comprised of at least 90% organic ingredients. No genetic modification, no pesticides, no BS just great beer.\r\n\r\nREUSE, RECYCLE & REDUCE\r\n\r\nElbow grease is an understatement to how we built our brewery. We spent hours on end thinking of ways for us to recycle, reuse and reduce our footprint. We started by making all of the furniture in the brewery out of shipping crates and pallets and continued with repurposing items to make our taproom. We may not have the capital just yet to have a ton of fancy energy recapturing devices, but we did create a way to recycle the water we use to chill out wort through a series of hoses so that the beer you drink was actually made from water that was used to chill our wort recapturing not only the water but also the heat reducing the energy it takes to heat our water. Think about it beer being made from making beer?\r\n\r\nWHY DOES THIS MATTER?\r\n\r\nWe want to bring you the best beer while also making sure it is actually good for both you and the environment around you.

Having been homebrewing for a couple of years, Tom wrote a \u2018cartoon\u2019 of a business plan that stated that a 3 barrel brewery could make a profit (in the first year, no less!).\r\n\r\nArmed with said business plan and a cashed in 401k, Tom and his wife DeAnn proceeded to convert a metal storage shed on their property into a nascent brewery.\r\n\r\nLake Louie Brewing is located on 18.5 acres of land purchased from Tom\u2019s uncle Louie Carpenter (hence the name \u2018Lake Louie\u2019) near the small town of Arena, Wisconsin (population: not too many, traffic lights: zero).  Lake Louie was the skinny dipping pond for area youth (including Tom in his day).\r\n\r\nAt the end of one full year\u2019s brewing, Lake Louie has produced the astounding sum of 106 barrels of beer.  2001 year end totals:  276 barrels.  A 258% increase in one year (lookout Bud!).","website":"http:\/\/www.lakelouie.com\/","established":"2000","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/PfbcZa\/upload_pcPinz-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/PfbcZa\/upload_pcPinz-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/PfbcZa\/upload_pcPinz-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/PfbcZa\/upload_pcPinz-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/PfbcZa\/upload_pcPinz-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:00","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:50:15","locations":[{"id":"fHseLN","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"7556 Pine Road","locality":"Arena","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"53503","phone":"608-753-2675","website":"http:\/\/www.lakelouie.com\/","latitude":43.1706377,"longitude":-89.9323658,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:00","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"tqkeeC","name":"Mac Daddy Scotch Ale","nameDisplay":"Mac Daddy Scotch Ale","description":"A traditional style Scotch ale or \u201cWee Heavy\u201d, This beer is big and malty with notes of kettle caramelization and just a wee more than a hint of smoke.","abv":"8.8","styleId":15,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/tqkeeC\/upload_nrxeCH-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/tqkeeC\/upload_nrxeCH-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/tqkeeC\/upload_nrxeCH-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-22 15:42:13","updateDate":"2015-12-17 18:23:22","style":{"id":15,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Scotch Ale","shortName":"Scotch Ale","description":"Scotch ales are overwhelmingly malty and full-bodied.

Consisting of a larger than life grain bill that starts with our base malt and roasted barley, we pack our mash tun full of an immense amount of crushed grains. Once the mash has completed we draw off a portion of the wort and begin a kettle caramelization process turning thisdark liquid into a syrup-like consistency to bring out the full, rich flavors of the malt. Once this process has been completed we add this syrup into the boil with the rest of wort and continue on with an intensely long boil to further concentrate the fermentable sugars. After a lengthy fermentation process, Marauder emerges with an alcohol content that will slay the masses. If that wasn't enough, this beer escaped into hibernation inside oak barrels for 3 months where it soaked up the bourbon character of the oak. With one taste, Marauder will snare your senses with the full malt flavor, bourbon notes, and caramel sweetness. Don't even think about turning your back on Marauder...or you'll be sorry!","abv":"10","ibu":"35","glasswareId":6,"srmId":35,"availableId":2,"styleId":15,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/Hlq56J\/upload_dmjj11-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/Hlq56J\/upload_dmjj11-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/Hlq56J\/upload_dmjj11-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"Marinated Skirt Steak with Smoked Gouda Risotto","createDate":"2012-09-17 11:08:01","updateDate":"2015-12-16 18:51:23","glass":{"id":6,"name":"Snifter","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"srm":{"id":35,"name":"35","hex":"470606"},"available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"style":{"id":15,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Scotch Ale","shortName":"Scotch Ale","description":"Scotch ales are overwhelmingly malty and full-bodied.
