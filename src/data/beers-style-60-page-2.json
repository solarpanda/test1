In 2001 they began doing so with help from local wine maker Carlo Grootaert, and this project eventually developed into its own independent commercial concern.\r\n\r\nUpon its inception in 2003, Struise produced beers at the Caulier brewery in northern Hainaut. Since 2006, they have been made at the Deca brewing facility in Woesten-Vleteren in West Flanders. The firm has reported that their own microbrewery and tasting room in a renovated school building in Oostvleteren, is currently open & operational.\r\n\r\nThe company takes its name from the historic Flemish word for ostrich, which also is a contemporary slang term meaning \"tough\". They render the name into English as \"The Sturdy Brewers\", and many of their labels feature ostriches, a trait they share with Dutch microbrewery Brouwerij 't IJ.\r\n\r\nFollowing current industry trends made popular by American craft brewers, DSB has recently ventured into stronger, more flavorful beers and also barrel-aging. While often drawing upon various traditional styles, they have won acclaim by creating unique products which reflect their own personal vision.\r\n\r\nThey have also collaborated with other recent arrivals on the European artisan beer scene such as Denmark's Mikkeller, fellow Belgians Picobrouwerij Alvinne and Brouwerij De Molen of the Netherlands, as well as American brewers.","website":"http:\/\/struise.com\/","established":"2001","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/bjwFtZ\/upload_lRcQQa-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/bjwFtZ\/upload_lRcQQa-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/bjwFtZ\/upload_lRcQQa-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/bjwFtZ\/upload_lRcQQa-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/bjwFtZ\/upload_lRcQQa-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:44:16","locations":[{"id":"qcAp7N","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Woesten","locality":"Woesten","region":"West-Vlaanderen","website":"http:\/\/www.struisebrouwers.be\/","latitude":50.900311,"longitude":2.7831,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"BE","yearOpened":"2001","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"BE","name":"BELGIUM","displayName":"Belgium","isoThree":"BEL","numberCode":56,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"ydWWCw","name":"Four Barrel Quad","nameDisplay":"Four Barrel Quad","styleId":60,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/ydWWCw\/upload_syG4uZ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/ydWWCw\/upload_syG4uZ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/ydWWCw\/upload_syG4uZ-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-04-18 11:27:07","updateDate":"2015-12-17 03:14:27","style":{"id":60,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Quadrupel","shortName":"Belgian Quad","description":"Quadrupels or \"Quads\" are characterized by the immense presence of alcohol and balanced flavor, bitterness and aromas.

We've worked hard and are incredibly proud of the many successes we've enjoyed over the years. The Boston Beer Company has been cited as one of the best companies to work for by Boston Magazine, one of the Best Entry-Level Jobs by The Princeton Review, and our beers have won more awards than any other in history. Jim has been named an \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" by Inc. Magazine. Our brewers keep amazing us with innovative new brews, including Samuel Adams Utopias and our Samuel Adams Barrel Room Collection.\r\n\r\nJim has believed from the beginning that the more you know and understand about beer, the more you'll appreciate a beer like Samuel Adams Boston Lager. To begin that mission, all new employees go through intensive training on everything from ingredients, brewing, and beer styles, to taking care of the beer once it leaves the brewery. We're all beer lovers and protectors of the beer so we're trained how to identify off flavors and how to troubleshoot the causes. The passion for beer continues with an annual homebrew competition that we all take part in.\r\n\r\nOne of our wholesalers once asked Jim why he invested so much in training his people, when ultimately they might leave. Jim smiled and replied without hesitation: \"What if I didn't train them, and they stayed?\"\r\n\r\nEach year, usually in January, everyone gathers together. One of the highlights of the meeting is the beer trivia contest. With a culture so steeped in beer education and knowledge, winning is a pretty big deal. Recently, one of the hotel bartenders who was watching as the various teams arrived in costume with music and much enthusiasm and fanfare, said, \"I've always known Samuel Adams made the best beer in America, but now I see this is the greatest company in America.\" When you look around you see that The Boston Beer Company is a team of enthusiastic people who are passionate about beer and who really love coming to work every day to provide American drinkers with the best beer possible.\r\n\r\nThe Boston Beer Company, Inc. is a publicly-traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol, SAM.","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","established":"1984","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:24:45","locations":[{"id":"DF5YsC","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"30 Germania Street","locality":"Boston","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"02130","phone":"1-800-372-1131","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","latitude":42.314449,"longitude":-71.103365,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1984","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2015-12-02 19:22:03","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"MLUbXI","name":"Cincinnati","streetAddress":"1625 Central Parkway","locality":"Cincinnati","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45214","phone":"513-412-3200","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","latitude":39.1144986,"longitude":-84.5222061,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-12 13:10:57","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"XZ6L8a","name":"Production Brewery","streetAddress":"7880 Penn Drive","locality":"Breinigsville","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"18031","latitude":40.5759622,"longitude":-75.6290377,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2007","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-11-30 20:24:56","updateDate":"2015-12-02 19:22:03","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"dH30IO","name":"Four Headed Wooly Mammoth","nameDisplay":"Four Headed Wooly Mammoth","description":"Brewed with Dark Belgian Candi Syrup (Kandijstroop Donker) in the boil, which provides notes of anise, dark chocolate, caramel & toasted bread.

In 2003 Skip and Phin purchased the defunct Old Saddle Back Brewing Co. in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. All the equipment was removed and brought back to Lakewood, New York and set up at its new 10,000 square foot home, The Southern Tier Brewing Company. The Brewery began operations in February 2004 distributing regionally. By 2005 sales covered the majority of the New York State and the eastern half of Pennsylvania. In the beginning their two Flagship brands were a Pilsner and Mild Ale. Oh yeah they also brewed IPA! As it turned out the flagships were a flop and the IPA was a huge success.

But his obvious passion for the brewing craft led him to the title assistant brewer and eventually head brewer in short three years. At that time he joined forces with former NHB colleague Blair Potts to run Quality Assured Brewing, a consulting service for microbreweries throughout the North East. 1996 saw Rob as the Brew Master for both the Manchester and Westport, CT locations in The John Harvard\u2019s Brew House chain. While there, Rob won a gold medal at the Great American Beer Festival in the German Altbier category. Southern Connecticut, especially Norwalk, took a liking to Rob and that was where he became the brewmaster and operations manager for New England Brewing. He learned the sales end of beer and when the owners wanted to get out of the brewery business, Rob immediately took the opportunity to acquire the name of the company and re-locate the whole business just down the street from the kitchen where he first started making beer.","website":"http:\/\/newenglandbrewing.com\/","established":"2001","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/rAHla4\/upload_W9hQ0C-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/rAHla4\/upload_W9hQ0C-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/rAHla4\/upload_W9hQ0C-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/rAHla4\/upload_W9hQ0C-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/rAHla4\/upload_W9hQ0C-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:03","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:04:29","locations":[{"id":"jzO9Iv","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"7 Selden St","locality":"Woodbridge","region":"Connecticut","postalCode":"06525","phone":"203-387-2222","website":"http:\/\/newenglandbrewing.com\/","latitude":41.3389393,"longitude":-72.9816961,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2001","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:03","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"blL2mT","name":"Ganeshale","nameDisplay":"Ganeshale","description":"Our Belgian style quadrupel is aged in whiskey barrels.","abv":"11","availableId":4,"styleId":60,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/blL2mT\/upload_c4yaGb-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/blL2mT\/upload_c4yaGb-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/blL2mT\/upload_c4yaGb-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-14 16:39:41","updateDate":"2015-12-17 04:47:18","available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":60,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Quadrupel","shortName":"Belgian Quad","description":"Quadrupels or \"Quads\" are characterized by the immense presence of alcohol and balanced flavor, bitterness and aromas.

In 1886 Adam Schumacher bought the brewery and started brewing beer. In 1906, the Potosi Brewing Company was founded by Adam and his brothers Nicholas and Henry. At its peak, the Potosi Brewery had grown to be the fifth largest in Wisconsin, shipping a variety of labels including Good Old Potosi, Holiday, Garten Brau, Augsburger and others to destinations throughout the United States. In 1972 the brewery ceased operations and closed its doors.\r\n\r\nThe restoration of the Potosi Brewery began in 1995 when Gary David bought the ruined Potosi Brewery Bottling buildings. This nearly one square block of buildings had just suffered a major fire and most of the buildings were a total loss. After working three years to rebuild parts of what had been destroyed, Gary then turned his attention to the Brewery itself. Being awarded the high bid at the county auction he then enlisted the help of his friend Rick Tobin and cousin Denis David. It was the marketing genius of Denis and his wife Madonna in 1999 that brought the public on board through a community meeting. This meeting was overwhelmingly attended by the public and brought forth numerous suggestions as well as additional support. It was this gathering of the public that led to the formation of the Potosi Brewery Foundation in February of 2000.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, with restoration underway, the Potosi Brewery Foundation was selected by the American Breweriana Association to be the home to its national museum. According to Len Chylack, president of the American Breweriana Association, Potosi was selected over cities such as Milwaukee and St. Louis because of their passion for beer, brewery history and beer-making culture.","website":"http:\/\/www.potosibrewery.com\/","established":"1852","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_ZDaYgp-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_ZDaYgp-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_ZDaYgp-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_ZDaYgp-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_ZDaYgp-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2016-06-24 17:44:52","locations":[{"id":"HeStKS","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"209 South Main Street","extendedAddress":"Box 177","locality":"Potosi","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"53820","phone":"608-763-4002","website":"http:\/\/www.potosibrewery.com\/","latitude":42.6716654,"longitude":-90.7271709,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1852","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"MXbnmP","name":"Inspiring Monk","nameDisplay":"Inspiring Monk","description":"Amber in color with a tan head, this Belgian Quad quickly pulls you in with aromas of dark fruit, clove, and bubblegum.

Belgium. Boy on bike. (OK, make that a young man of 32). As our aspiring young homebrewer rides his mountain bike with fat tires through European villages famous for beer, New Belgium Brewing Company was but a glimmer in his eye. Or basement. For Jeff Lebesch would return to Fort Collins with a handful of ingredients and an imagination full of recipes. And then there was beer. Jeff's first two basement-brewed creations? A brown dubbel with earthy undertones named Abbey and a remarkably well-balanced amber he named Fat Tire. To say the rest was history would be to overlook his wife's involvement. Kim Jordan was New Belgium's first bottler, sales rep, distributor, marketer and financial planner.
