This is the spirit of Slumbrew.\r\n\r\nSlumbrew is the research & development brand and concept of Somerville Brewing Company. Our mission is to brew unique, ingredient-driven beers that challenge common notions of what a beer should taste like. It is the result of nearly 15 years of beer travel and research by Caitlin Jewell and Jeff Leiter; and a decade of Jeff\u2019s homebrewing recipe formulation.\r\n\r\nWe produce a lot of small-run, pilot beers at the Slumbrew Beerlab, but only a small number make their way to commercial production. The Somerville Brewing Company contracts with regional breweries to make the best recipes for wide-spread commercial release, but each recipe is an evolving process of refinement. This model for beer production provides an opportunity to experiment with innovative local ingredients to produce craft beers that stand apart from typical formulations.","website":"http:\/\/www.slumbrew.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gwDTjS\/upload_6jyi8Y-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gwDTjS\/upload_6jyi8Y-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gwDTjS\/upload_6jyi8Y-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gwDTjS\/upload_6jyi8Y-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gwDTjS\/upload_6jyi8Y-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-02-13 00:30:15","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:28:13","locations":[{"id":"pATY6L","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"15 Ward St.","locality":"Somerville","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"02143","phone":"1-800-428-1150","website":"http:\/\/www.slumbrew.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  11:00am - 12:00am\nTue:  11:00am - 12:00am\nWed:  11:00am - 12:00am\nThu:  11:00am - 12:00am\nFri:  11:00am - 12:00am\nSat:  11:00am - 12:00am\nSun:  11:00am - 10:00pm\n\n","latitude":42.3748173,"longitude":-71.0892732,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-02-13 00:36:08","updateDate":"2015-05-08 13:45:09","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"KmOr3n","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"15 Ward Street","locality":"Somerville","region":"MA","hoursOfOperation":"11am - 12am","latitude":42.3748173,"longitude":-71.0892732,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2015-04-29 21:38:08","updateDate":"2015-05-08 13:45:44","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"dgdVJz","name":"American Fresh Beer Garden","streetAddress":"310 Canal St.","locality":"Somerville","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"02145","phone":"1.800.428.1150","hoursOfOperation":"Tue:  11:00am - 10:00pm\nWed:  11:00am - 10:00am\nThu:  11:00am - 12:00am\nFri:  11:00am - 12:00am\nSat:  11:00am - 12:00am\nSun:  11:00am - 12:00am\n\n","latitude":42.3941311,"longitude":-71.079673,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-05-08 13:50:59","updateDate":"2015-05-08 13:50:59","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"kQ6cJ9","name":"Porter From Hell","nameDisplay":"Porter From Hell","styleId":18,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:59","updateDate":"2015-04-10 19:10:25","style":{"id":18,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Brown Porter","shortName":"Brown Porter","description":"Brown porters are mid to dark brown (may have red tint) in color.

And that sweet life is infused in every beverage we create. To us, life on the water means creating and savoring memories and moments that are cherished for a lifetime. And what better way to enhance those memories and moments than with the right beverage to sip and savor. \r\n\r\nThe founders of Big Bay have a strong fundamental belief that craft brewed beverages and life on the water go hand in hand. Alone, what we drink is just sustenance, but paired with the right sights, sounds and settings, it becomes part of a much larger experience. And we are dedicated to bringing the \u201cexperience\u201d back to brewing. After all, our personal life experiences have played a leading role in developing Big Bay Brewing. And as we grow, we invite you to be a part of Big Bay by sharing your experiences with us. In other words, we want you to be a part of the sweet life with us.","website":"http:\/\/www.bigbaybrewing.com\/","established":"2009","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/www.bigbaybrewing.com\/signup","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/6HJHio\/upload_tuQMSB-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/6HJHio\/upload_tuQMSB-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/6HJHio\/upload_tuQMSB-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/6HJHio\/upload_tuQMSB-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/6HJHio\/upload_tuQMSB-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:46","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:18:11","locations":[{"id":"0vxydH","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"4517 North Oakland Avenue","locality":"Milwaukee","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"53211","phone":"888-964-2869","website":"http:\/\/www.bigbaybrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Tue - Wed: 4:00 pm - 7:00 pm\r\nThu:\t12:00 pm - 8:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 12:00 pm - 9:00 pm\r\nSun: 12:00 pm - 4:00 pm","latitude":43.0987742,"longitude":-87.8875605,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2009","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:46","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
