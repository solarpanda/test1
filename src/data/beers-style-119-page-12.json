Ayinger beers have been frequent award winners in international beer competitions.\r\n\r\nFor some years, a range of beer was brewed under the Ayingerbrau name by Samuel Smith's Brewery in Tadcaster, United Kingdom. Although the Ayinger logo was used, the recipes and range were different from those of the Ayinger Brewery. The arrangement ended in spring 2006, at which point Samuel Smith's rebranded the beers. Distribution of the Ayinger range of beer followed that summer. Because the Oktoberfest in Munich does not allow breweries outside its city limits to participate, Ayinger Brewery organizes many smaller festivals in the countryside around Munich.","website":"http:\/\/en.ayinger-bier.de\/","established":"1878","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QKdFk2\/upload_jjUvnX-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QKdFk2\/upload_jjUvnX-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QKdFk2\/upload_jjUvnX-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QKdFk2\/upload_jjUvnX-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QKdFk2\/upload_jjUvnX-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-28 16:51:35","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:36:51","locations":[{"id":"eqCbpj","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"M\u00fcnchner Stra\u00dfe 21","region":"Aying","postalCode":"D-85653","phone":"49080958890","isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-10-07 20:47:32","updateDate":"2014-10-07 20:47:32","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"WAvxrj","name":"Radler","nameDisplay":"Radler","description":"Ein frischer Mix aus fruchtiger Zitronenlimonade und Bier.\r\n\r\nDas Radler \u00e2\u20ac\u201c die Urform aller Bier-Mix-Getr\u00e4nke.
