From landing in the welcoming arms of Petaluma, and actually getting our beer into bottles, onto the streets, and into the hands of sympathatic beer geeks, to steadily losing less money each month. From all this and more, Lagunitas Brewing Company is emerging as a battle-tested brewery capable of making great beer out of goat's milk, brambles, and asphalt on the surface of the Moon, if need be.\r\n\r\nAs the poet once said, 'Where, but for the grace of God and the kindness of strangers, go I'.

We operated with a menu of fresh, made-to-order hamburgers, fresh cut French Fries and real ice cream shakes. Our 2nd location was here at our Silverdale location. We had fun and we still have Silver City Guests ask us about 39 cent hamburgers and grilled onion burgers. We miss 'em too, but we proved it's real hard to put the big hamburger chains out of business. It isn't as easy as it looks.\r\n\r\nIn 1996 we decided to switch gears and get into the Brewpub business. We sold our Bremerton location and remodeled the Silverdale location into what it is today.\r\n\r\nWe operate today on the same principles as we did when we opened our first Top Notch Burger. We work hard at making sure each Guest leaves happier than when they arrived.

After the abolition of the Neudeck Cloister in 1799, the building was converted into a penitentiary. Franz Xaver Zacherl, the brewer, purchased the former cloister brewery and continued the Starkbier tradition with the product Salvator, which is latin for Saviour. In 1861 the Salvatorkeller (Salvator cellar) was opened upon Nockherberg. In 1928 the brewery merged with the Gebr\u00fcder Thomas brewery creating Paulaner Salvator Thomas Br\u00e4u. 1994 saw the acquisition into the Kulmbacher brewery group with the affiliated producers Plauen and Chemnitz. A daughter company is the Auer Br\u00e4u AG Rosenheim. Paulaner belongs to the BHI (Brau Holding International AG), a joint venture between Sch\u00f6rghuber Ventures (50.1%) and with Holland's Heineken N.V.

Today, beer connoisseurs in Germany and around the world regard our traditional specialty beers from Erding, Bavaria, as the ultimate in wheat beer enjoyment.\r\n\r\nThe beginnings of Erdinger Weissbr\u00e4u date back to 1886, the year in which construction of a wheat beer brewery in Erding was first officially recorded. After several changes in ownership, the General Manager at the time, Franz Brombach, bought the brewery in 1935 and re-named it Erdinger Weissbr\u00e4u on December 27, 1949.\r\n\r\nIn 1965, the son of Franz Brombach, Werner Brombach, entered the business. He took over the private brewery in 1975 and still leads his father's successful business today. In addition to a strong emphasis on quality, Werner Brombach focuses above all on a targeted sales and promotion strategy with a clear brand identity, which highlights the values of the old Bavarian beer specialty and its superior quality standards.\r\n\r\nToday, Erdinger weissbier stands for wheat beer enjoyment and the Bavarian brewing tradition. The traditional brewery has established itself as the national and international market leader for weissbier. As one of Germany's largest private breweries, Erdinger Weissbr\u00e4u is among the leaders on the national German beer market.","website":"http:\/\/www.erdinger.de","established":"1886","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/m9SH4l\/upload_gwY2SS-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/m9SH4l\/upload_gwY2SS-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/m9SH4l\/upload_gwY2SS-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/m9SH4l\/upload_gwY2SS-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/m9SH4l\/upload_gwY2SS-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:55:12","locations":[{"id":"qVyAhN","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Franz-Brombach-Strae 1-20","locality":"Erding","region":"Bayern","phone":"49-(0)8122-\/-4090","latitude":48.31532,"longitude":11.89111,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"OGFQGG","name":"Fig Weizenbock","nameDisplay":"Fig Weizenbock","description":"A farm hand carrying a golden sheaf of wheat collides haphazardly with a young lady back from an abundant harvest of juicy figs.

In 2003 Skip and Phin purchased the defunct Old Saddle Back Brewing Co. in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. All the equipment was removed and brought back to Lakewood, New York and set up at its new 10,000 square foot home, The Southern Tier Brewing Company. The Brewery began operations in February 2004 distributing regionally. By 2005 sales covered the majority of the New York State and the eastern half of Pennsylvania. In the beginning their two Flagship brands were a Pilsner and Mild Ale. Oh yeah they also brewed IPA! As it turned out the flagships were a flop and the IPA was a huge success. They next launched a line of seasonal beers which have gained great success. Since the beginning, Southern Tier has experienced steady growth, currently distributing to over 25% of the United States. Multiple expansions have been made to keep up with demand and the brewery continues to be innovative by producing new products.

Garrett\u2019s concept for the collaboration was that each brewmaster would brew essentially the same pale, hoppy weissbock in the other\u2019s brewery, but with different hopping to reflect the local hop flavor.\r\n\r\nGarrett traveled to the 400 yr-old Schneider brewery in Kelheim, Germany, to brew Schneider-Brooklyner Hopfen-Weisse. This was dry-hopped with the local Hallertauer Saphir hop variety. A couple months later, Drexler brought his yeast to Brooklyn and brewed Brooklyner-Schneider Hopfen-Weisse, choosing the American Amarillo and Palisade varieties for the dry-hopping. The beer has a full orange color and the aromatics pair the banana and clove notes from the Schneider yeast with the mango and citrus qualities of the hops. The bitterness is robust but balanced, and the beer has a clean, hoppy finish.","abv":"7.8","glasswareId":9,"availableId":3,"styleId":53,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/AT5UIb\/upload_sh6KsV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/AT5UIb\/upload_sh6KsV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/AT5UIb\/upload_sh6KsV-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"Caribbean seafood preparations, crab cakes, jerk chicken, Thai cuisine, Szechuan cooking and many Mexican dishes.","originalGravity":"1.078","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:25","updateDate":"2015-12-16 04:46:34","glass":{"id":9,"name":"Weizen","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":3,"name":"Not Available","description":"Beer is not available."},"style":{"id":53,"categoryId":4,"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"South German-Style Weizenbock \/ Weissbock","shortName":"Weizenbock","description":"This style can be either pale or dark (golden to dark brown in color) and has a high starting gravity and alcohol content.
