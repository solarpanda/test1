The saloon enjoyed a brisk business from the turn of the century until the advent of prohibition in 1920. The building, rich in history, is on the national registry of historic landmarks and has been restored to much of its original grandeur. Among the original architectural elements that remain today are the beautiful bar, intricate mosaic tile floor, much of the stained glass and of course the decorative ceiling.

This made it impossible for microbreweries or small brewpubs to exist. In 1985 Uli Bennewitz went to his local senator and together they passed a bill allowing microbreweries to sell their own beer on site. A year later on the July 4th, 1986 the Weeping Radish Brewery opened for business. \r\n \r\nRaised in a small village in Bavaria, Uli was determined to bring the high quality beer he was used to across the ocean to North Carolina. A Master Brewer came over from Germany and brewed the first batches of Corolla Gold, Fest, and Black Radish. Strictly adhering to the Reinheitsgebot Purity Law of 1516, all Weeping Radish beers are brewed using hops, malt, yeast and water \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no additives, chemicals or preservatives. \r\n \r\nOur beer list has expanded over the years and currently on draft in the pub we have the OBX K\u00c3\u00b6lsch, IPA 25, and Radler as well as our original Corolla Gold, Fest and Black Radish.

After ending up on the wrong side of the tracks a few times, they were finally pointed in the direction of Virginia-Highlands and found a few bars willing to take a chance on them. \"We'll give you a shot as long as your dog stops begging for leftovers on our patio\" was the cautious approval they needed to get the brand rolling.\r\n\r\nSweetWater's second and current location is in Midtown Atlanta, adjacent to Ansley Park, in the Armour Circle Industrial Park just off of Piedmont and Monroe. The boys saved all of their pennies to buy the 25,000 square feet of brewing goodness and smack in the middle of all the action. Since the company began we've wanted to be closer to our homes, the bars and stores that sell our beer, and all the good folks that drink it. Fortunately seven years of great growth gave the company that opportunity. We learned a lot from that location and left all those mistakes behind as we built our new home. SweetWater Brewing Company has been here since 2004 and it feels good to be settled in.

It had a very mom and pop feel, and featured a look that was as traditional as it gets. Those who knew of it visited regularly, but the regulars were few. For many, the brewery was a thing shrouded in mystery... college students-which comprise a fair percentage of Ellensburg's population for most of the year-would occasionally see a bottle on a store shelf and ask where it came from. The likely response:\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, I think some dude makes that in his basement or something...\"\r\n\r\nThe word just wasn't getting out, and things didn't look good for the tiny brewery that made exceptionally tasty ales. \r\nWell, a couple of hoodlums in their late-twenties jumped on the opportunity to own and operate their own brewery, and what resulted is the Iron Horse Brewery you know and love today. They tweaked some recipes, changed some names, threw some ridiculous theme parties to encourage locals to actually see the brewery with their own eyes, and good things started to happen. Locals started to dig what the guys were doing. A few bars took a chance and put Iron Horse back on tap, and the beer started flowing. \r\n\r\nThe word started getting out.","website":"http:\/\/www.ironhorsebrewery.com\/","established":"2004","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ni4EnY\/upload_V7RJjR-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ni4EnY\/upload_V7RJjR-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ni4EnY\/upload_V7RJjR-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ni4EnY\/upload_V7RJjR-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ni4EnY\/upload_V7RJjR-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:04:41","locations":[{"id":"xZTJW3","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1000 Prospect Street","extendedAddress":"Suite 4","locality":"Ellensburg","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98926","phone":"509-933-3134","website":"http:\/\/www.ironhorsebrewery.com\/","latitude":46.9994703,"longitude":-120.5648701,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2004","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"cH1ln0","name":"Iron Horse IPA","nameDisplay":"Iron Horse IPA","description":"A pale ale with full hop flavor and aroma.","abv":"6.6","availableId":1,"styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"Burgers and steaks.","createDate":"2015-10-01 20:00:02","updateDate":"2015-10-02 19:43:36","available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

As veterans and patriots, we find that we owe it to our patrons to only produce the finest beer made with the best ingredients with the same level of attention to detail and passion that we brought to serving our country.\r\n\r\n100% American sourced ingredients & Organic base malts\r\n\r\n92% Locally sourced or Organic ingredients\r\n\r\n1% Of every pint goes to charity\r\n\r\nORGANIC & SUSTAINABLE\r\n\r\nIt is worth the extra effort to pay a little more, make a little less and put a whole lot of elbow grease into things to make a better product. A better product that not only tastes great, but is also made in a responsible and sustainable way. We use 100% organic 2-Row in all of our beers and each of our beers is comprised of at least 90% organic ingredients. No genetic modification, no pesticides, no BS just great beer.\r\n\r\nREUSE, RECYCLE & REDUCE\r\n\r\nElbow grease is an understatement to how we built our brewery. We spent hours on end thinking of ways for us to recycle, reuse and reduce our footprint. We started by making all of the furniture in the brewery out of shipping crates and pallets and continued with repurposing items to make our taproom. We may not have the capital just yet to have a ton of fancy energy recapturing devices, but we did create a way to recycle the water we use to chill out wort through a series of hoses so that the beer you drink was actually made from water that was used to chill our wort recapturing not only the water but also the heat reducing the energy it takes to heat our water. Think about it beer being made from making beer?\r\n\r\nWHY DOES THIS MATTER?\r\n\r\nWe want to bring you the best beer while also making sure it is actually good for both you and the environment around you. So the next time you have a pint of Heritage be sure to stop and think about all that is going into the beer in front of you.\r\n\r\nCome check out our taproom when your in northern Virginia or grab one of our beers on tap or in stores.","website":"http:\/\/heritagebrewing.com\/","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/LWv6MU\/upload_msDI5Z-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/LWv6MU\/upload_msDI5Z-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/LWv6MU\/upload_msDI5Z-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/LWv6MU\/upload_msDI5Z-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/LWv6MU\/upload_msDI5Z-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-09-21 20:34:56","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:47:30","locations":[{"id":"UNp9ot","name":"Heritage Brewing Co.","streetAddress":"9436 Center Point Lane","locality":"Manassas","region":"Virginia","postalCode":"20110","website":"http:\/\/heritagebrewing.com\/","latitude":38.752225,"longitude":-77.4895437,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-09-21 20:35:22","updateDate":"2015-10-13 19:23:55","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"WUmJXQ","name":"Ironstone IPA","nameDisplay":"Ironstone IPA","abv":"8.75","glasswareId":5,"availableId":4,"styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-04-13 18:23:17","updateDate":"2015-06-02 16:07:40","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.
