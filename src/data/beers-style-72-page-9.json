After returning to the states, they had trouble finding that type of beer in Chicago so they opened Two Brothers Brewing Company in 1996. To get them started, the brothers' grandfather, a retired dairy farmer, donated his bulk milk tanks, which were quickly converted to fermenters. Currently, the brewery resides in a 40,000 square foot facility 30 miles west of Chicago. In addition to their traditional style beers, Two Brothers Brewing Company produces many specialty beers including the Project Opus Sour series. Adjacent to the brewery, Two Brothers Tap House opened in 2008 as a restaurant which serves elevated, seasonal, and organic American pub fare. In 2011, the Ebel brothers purchased Walter Payton's Roundhouse located in Aurora, IL.

Way back in 1988, Luch Scremin was a Freshman in college and became interested in brewing his own beer.  Since the internet did not exist, Luch was forced to order a \u201cbeer kit\u201d from an ad in the back of an issue of Popular Mechanics.  Suffice it to say that what resulted was indeed beer but was far from great.\r\n\r\nFast forward twenty years and the love of beer and the desire to brew it had matured over years of home brewing and an insatiable appetite for delicious brew.  Luch traveled the world with his job in the airline business and was treated to many delicious beer styles and beer culture.  In 2008 while planning to open a beer bar and brewpub,  Luch met his future business partners Andy and Sean.  The three were soon making the business a reality.\r\n\r\nAll that was left was a name.  They soon decided they would name the brewery for Luch\u2019s 1962 Ford Fire Engine \u2013 after all, they just don\u2019t make them like that anymore.  It represents all that Engine 15 Brewing Co. is about. Camaraderie, old school know how, determination and a simple but serious dedication to the cause.\r\nAs of 2011, Engine 15 Brewing Co. has enjoyed success and was even voted best Pub and Brewpub  in Jacksonville by the Folio Weekly readers poll.

The relatively high carbonation releases subtle aromas of bitter chocolate, tart fruit, spice, and herbal hops.

He realized these types of beers were his true passion and decided to create a place where he could focus solely on 100% oak barrel fermentations using saccharomyces, brettanomyces and lactic acid bacteria, all while using local Colorado ingredients.\r\n\r\nCasey Brewing and Blending is the idea of bringing back old-world brewing techniques to the modern day consumer. Our beers are created with over 99% local Colorado ingredients. We ferment and age our beers in vintage oak barrels with a mixed culture of saccharomyces, brettanomyces and lactic acid bacteria. Time is one of the most important elements to us, as the barrel aging process creates flavors that are impossible to create any other way.  Our beers are unfiltered and 100% bottle conditioned.","website":"http:\/\/www.caseybrewing.com","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/J6OPsX\/upload_UrpdNM-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/J6OPsX\/upload_UrpdNM-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/J6OPsX\/upload_UrpdNM-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/J6OPsX\/upload_UrpdNM-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/J6OPsX\/upload_UrpdNM-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-01-04 02:32:50","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:03:03","locations":[{"id":"SlryVk","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"3421 Grand Avenue","locality":"Glenwood Springs","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"81601","phone":"(970) 230-9691","hoursOfOperation":"Since the majority of our beers are still aging, our brewery opening times will be extremely limited and sporadic.
