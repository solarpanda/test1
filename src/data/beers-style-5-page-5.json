Sam had a great garage and Karl had nearly 10 years brewing experience, so they began brewing beer in Sam's garage almost weekly. Equipment was accumulated, techniques were shared, and plenty of free beer was available for their friends. Karl was finishing his M.S. in Geological Engineering and Sam was in the middle of his Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering when they decided to go legitimate. The LLC was formed in August 2012 and they entered the Student Governors Giant Vision Award contest, where they placed third, winning $2500.\r\nIt took nearly a year to find a suitable location, but they finally settled on an unused and beat up garage at the Fairmont Creamery (current location). After six months of renovation, the tavern opened January 1, 2014. The beginning was modest, with a 1.5 bbl brewehouse, a 42 gal Blichman fermenter, and two 1.5 bbl single walled fermenters, but their limited time and production complemented their limited overhead.\r\nKarl received his Masters degree and began working at the US Geological Survey and Sam was still finishing his PhD, so the beer was brewed on the weekends and Friday was the only open night. In August 2014, two additional 3 BBL jacketed fermenters were installed, essentially tripling their production capacity. In January 2015, Hay Camp opened on Thursday nights, where they collaborate with Black Hills Vinyl for live music and bingo.\r\nThe patio opened spring 2015, which expanded seating capacity and overall fun. Patrons could play corn hole, country bucket, or just soak up the nice summer sun. In July 2015, they ordered a new 3 BBL brewhouse and expect the delivery late fall.\r\nLong term, Hay Camp Brewing Company will remain true to it's Rapid City roots. The current plan is to move toward a 10 BBL production brewery and begin distributing to local drafts. Growth is iterative, however, so stay tuned for adaptation post perturbation.","website":"http:\/\/www.haycampbrewing.com\/index.html","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-07-14 14:51:47","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:13:39","locations":[{"id":"Za6Nem","name":"Hay Camp Brewing Co","streetAddress":"201 Main St","locality":"Rapid City","region":"South Dakota","postalCode":"57701","phone":"(970) 215 9859","website":"http:\/\/www.haycampbrewing.com\/index.html","latitude":44.079643,"longitude":-103.2200919,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-09-24 18:07:31","updateDate":"2015-11-20 15:50:05","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"ZTcuKV","name":"Extra Special Bitter","nameDisplay":"Extra Special Bitter","abv":"6.3","styleId":5,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/ZTcuKV\/upload_F3ddQx-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/ZTcuKV\/upload_F3ddQx-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/ZTcuKV\/upload_F3ddQx-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-10-16 18:19:01","updateDate":"2015-12-17 18:08:15","style":{"id":5,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Extra Special Bitter","shortName":"ESB","description":"Extra special bitter possesses medium to strong hop aroma, flavor, and bitterness.

You\u2019ll use them for about seven minutes and then we have to throw them away. It\u2019s nothing personal. If you absolutely need one we\u2019re happy to oblige, but we\u2019re trying to reduce our non-recyclables, keep our landfills at a minimum, and keep plastic out of our oceans. Find a kid and ask them about plastic. Plastic pollutes our oceans and air, so we serve our beverages in glass. If you want to bring a kid cup from home, we\u2019ll fill it up!\r\n\r\nWhat, no Coasters? You\u2019d be amazed at how many coasters we pick up off the floor. If our tables were Peruvian mahogany, inlaid with reclaimed oak from an historic church in New Brunswick, we\u2019d say \u201check yeah, give that pizza patron a coaster!\u201d Let\u2019s conserve together.\r\n\r\nHopefully you\u2019re now thinking, \u201cWow Henrietta, these are some globally concerned restaurateurs.\u201d But, then again, maybe you\u2019re wondering about the lack of ice in the sodas? Are we trying to conserve ice bergs? Nope. We don\u2019t even know any icebergs. Our soda\u2019s are handmade with the finest extracts available, fantastic water and cane sugar. They\u2019re served at cellar temps just like our beers, so you get a full flavored beverage that doesn\u2019t need to be watered down. There\u2019s a saying in Colorado, Whiskey\u2019s for drinking, water\u2019s for fighting. (We also have Whiskey, no fighting). If you want ice, just ask. We\u2019ll not think less of you. Becoming a soda pop connoisseur takes time.\r\n\r\nFrom all of us at Moonlight Pizza: Kick back, order another beer, enjoy the sunset, and don\u2019t forget your leftovers! Peace.","website":"http:\/\/www.moonlightpizza.biz","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/WHQisc\/upload_dj5BJ3-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/WHQisc\/upload_dj5BJ3-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/WHQisc\/upload_dj5BJ3-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/WHQisc\/upload_dj5BJ3-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/WHQisc\/upload_dj5BJ3-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-06-27 21:19:45","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:44:12","locations":[{"id":"m2lpu3","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"242 F St. Salida","locality":"Salida","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"81201","phone":"(719) 539-4277","website":"http:\/\/www.moonlightpizza.biz","hoursOfOperation":"Mon-Thur: 11am-9pm\r\nFri-Sat: 11am-9:30pm\r\nSun: 11am-8pm","latitude":38.534857,"longitude":-105.993522,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-06-27 21:21:08","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"HvrjrN","name":"Extra Special Bitter (ESB)","nameDisplay":"Extra Special Bitter (ESB)","description":"Bitter, which accounts for 40% of draught sales in England, usually comes in three strengths.

In 1886 Adam Schumacher bought the brewery and started brewing beer. In 1906, the Potosi Brewing Company was founded by Adam and his brothers Nicholas and Henry. At its peak, the Potosi Brewery had grown to be the fifth largest in Wisconsin, shipping a variety of labels including Good Old Potosi, Holiday, Garten Brau, Augsburger and others to destinations throughout the United States. In 1972 the brewery ceased operations and closed its doors.\r\n\r\nThe restoration of the Potosi Brewery began in 1995 when Gary David bought the ruined Potosi Brewery Bottling buildings. This nearly one square block of buildings had just suffered a major fire and most of the buildings were a total loss. After working three years to rebuild parts of what had been destroyed, Gary then turned his attention to the Brewery itself. Being awarded the high bid at the county auction he then enlisted the help of his friend Rick Tobin and cousin Denis David. It was the marketing genius of Denis and his wife Madonna in 1999 that brought the public on board through a community meeting. This meeting was overwhelmingly attended by the public and brought forth numerous suggestions as well as additional support. It was this gathering of the public that led to the formation of the Potosi Brewery Foundation in February of 2000.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, with restoration underway, the Potosi Brewery Foundation was selected by the American Breweriana Association to be the home to its national museum. According to Len Chylack, president of the American Breweriana Association, Potosi was selected over cities such as Milwaukee and St. Louis because of their passion for beer, brewery history and beer-making culture.","website":"http:\/\/www.potosibrewery.com\/","established":"1852","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_sKK4eq-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_sKK4eq-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_sKK4eq-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_sKK4eq-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_sKK4eq-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:14:24","locations":[{"id":"HeStKS","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"209 South Main Street","extendedAddress":"Box 177","locality":"Potosi","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"53820","phone":"608-763-4002","website":"http:\/\/www.potosibrewery.com\/","latitude":42.6716654,"longitude":-90.7271709,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1852","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"WBCmm0","name":"Extra Special Bitter Ale","nameDisplay":"Extra Special Bitter Ale","abv":"6.5","styleId":5,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/WBCmm0\/upload_5oN8Ze-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/WBCmm0\/upload_5oN8Ze-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/WBCmm0\/upload_5oN8Ze-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-04-19 09:24:08","updateDate":"2015-12-17 01:17:48","style":{"id":5,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Extra Special Bitter","shortName":"ESB","description":"Extra special bitter possesses medium to strong hop aroma, flavor, and bitterness.

Herman\u2019s desire to expand the market for the family\u2019s beer led him to sell the product at the Chicago World\u2019s Fair where it received high acclaim. Since then, Berghoff has continued its success and relevance in the Chicago market and beyond.           \r\n\r\n   As the craft beer market has evolved, the brand has received fresh, exciting updates. Berghoff changed its brewing location and is now proudly brewed at Point Brewery in Stevens Point, Wisconsin. Berghoff has also refreshed itself with updated recipes and packaging. With consulting from brewing experts Randy Mosher and John Hannafan, Berghoff\u2019s new, top-notch beers are ready to satisfy consumer demand. As the brewery looks to the future, Berghoff beer will continue to evolve as trends change, but will always maintain its roots as an authentic German-style brew whose history and tradition will never be forgotten.","website":"http:\/\/berghoffbeer.com\/","established":"1887","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/nJjPsG\/upload_stjdDM-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/nJjPsG\/upload_stjdDM-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/nJjPsG\/upload_stjdDM-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/nJjPsG\/upload_stjdDM-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/nJjPsG\/upload_stjdDM-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-11-16 18:24:04","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:38:55","locations":[{"id":"kU9sBG","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"3122 W.
