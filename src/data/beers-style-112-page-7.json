In 2003 Skip and Phin purchased the defunct Old Saddle Back Brewing Co. in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. All the equipment was removed and brought back to Lakewood, New York and set up at its new 10,000 square foot home, The Southern Tier Brewing Company. The Brewery began operations in February 2004 distributing regionally. By 2005 sales covered the majority of the New York State and the eastern half of Pennsylvania. In the beginning their two Flagship brands were a Pilsner and Mild Ale. Oh yeah they also brewed IPA! As it turned out the flagships were a flop and the IPA was a huge success. They next launched a line of seasonal beers which have gained great success. Since the beginning, Southern Tier has experienced steady growth, currently distributing to over 25% of the United States. Multiple expansions have been made to keep up with demand and the brewery continues to be innovative by producing new products.

This beer was brewed by the brewers who started between 1992 and 1997. Using a local farm connection which grows raw unmalted wheat was one of the elements of this beer. It is a slightly stronger wheat beer with an ABV of 7% aged in bourbon barrels. It has a light amber color mainly from the Honey Malt used in the brew, a heaping helping of locally grown wildflower honey as well as color pick up from char in the bourbon barrels. There is a citrus quality to this beer as well from both the use of lemon juice and Citra hops in both the kettle, whirlpool and dry-hopping. The combination of honey, citrus and bourbon flavors is reminiscent of a Hot Toddy and was a theme from which we worked this variation. Quite frankly we don\u2019t know what to expect from such a beer, but look forward to when it is ready. We hope you enjoy this sampling of our personal stamp on the discovery and wonder of the art of exploration in brewing.","abv":"7","glasswareId":5,"availableId":2,"styleId":112,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/SL9VVW\/upload_7ufayJ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/SL9VVW\/upload_7ufayJ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/SL9VVW\/upload_7ufayJ-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:25","updateDate":"2015-12-16 06:08:00","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"style":{"id":112,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Light American Wheat Ale or Lager with Yeast","shortName":"Wheat Ale","description":"This beer can be made using either ale or lager yeast.

Lake Michigan creates a maritime climate on the Island, giving the wheat crop very unique characteristics that carry through to the personality of the beer.\r\n\r\nWhen you enjoy your first Island Wheat, you will notice that it has a hazy, golden hue and a dense, rocky head. This beer is one of those rare brews that a wide variety of beer drinkers will enjoy. Those that find lighter beer appealing will find the refreshing mildness to their liking.

Rogue closed its Ashland operation in 1997, after the great flood destroyed the place. In 1991, the 15bbl system, named Howard after John Maier's former boss, from the Newport brewpub was transferred across the bay to the current brewery and upgraded to a 30bbl system. In 1998 Rogue bought a 50bbl brewsystem, named Kobe. Kobe is the only brewsystem in use. Tours: We offer brewery tours every day at 3 pm (followed by a distillery tour at 4pm). Go up to the bar inside the brewery (Brewers on the Bay) and check in with the bartender and the tour will commence.

Big Muddy Brewing in Murphysboro, Illinois is much like many of these new \u201cmicrobreweries\u201d all over the country, reinvigorating an industry and continuing a heritage that has skipped several generations.\r\nUntil 1940, Murphysboro was the home of a thriving brewery and until prohibition; it was one of the cornerstones of the town\u2019s industry. In 1910, the Stecher Brewing Company produced more than 40,000 barrels of beer a year. However, passage of the Volstead Act in 1919, which ushered in the era of prohibition, began a slow decline to the brewery\u2019s demise.\r\nBig Muddy Brewing\u2019s founder Chuck Stuhrenberg attended Southern Illinois University Carbondale in the 1980s. After graduation, he opened a franchise of Chicago\u2019s Rosati\u2019s Pizza in Carbondale and in 1990, began another venture, Spray Shield Industries.\r\nIt was while Stuhrenberg was in college at SIU that he began making his own beer.\r\nStuhrenberg and his college buddies would homebrew, and as the years went on, he began to take his hobby more seriously.\r\nStuhrenberg always had professional brewing in the back of his mind, but it stayed a hobby until 2009. In July, 2009, Big Muddy Brewing finally began production, the first brewery in Murphysboro in over 50 years.\r\nThe first beer offered by Big Muddy Brewing is Kinkaid Wheat. It was a recipe popular with Stuhrenberg\u2019s family and friends. It was also something he felt would be a good \u201ccraft beer transition brew\u201d for those used to the conventional corporate brew (BMC).\r\nKinkaid Wheat is currently offered on tap and by bottle in bars, restaurants and liquor stores across Southern Illinois alongside of Big Muddy Brewing\u2019s second selection, \u201cSaluki Dunkel Dog\u201d, a dark, amber\/dunkel style beer.\r\nThe third and newest addition to Big Muddy Brewing\u2019s lineup is an ale called \u201cBig Muddy Pale Ale\u201d, and future varieties include \u201cLogan\u2019s Lager\u201d.","website":"http:\/\/www.bigmuddybrewing.com\/","established":"2009","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/oBe8dQ\/upload_W7yNNA-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/oBe8dQ\/upload_W7yNNA-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/oBe8dQ\/upload_W7yNNA-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/oBe8dQ\/upload_W7yNNA-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/oBe8dQ\/upload_W7yNNA-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:46","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:18:15","locations":[{"id":"QkdgSV","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1430 North 7th Street","locality":"Murphysboro","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"62966","phone":"(618) 684-8833","website":"http:\/\/www.bigmuddybrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sat: 11:00 am - 3:00 pm\r\n`","latitude":37.7823381,"longitude":-89.3321145,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2009","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:46","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"WMfnnC","name":"Knee Deep in Surf","nameDisplay":"Knee Deep in Surf","abv":"5.3","ibu":"16","glasswareId":5,"availableId":4,"styleId":112,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/WMfnnC\/upload_68Lhu2-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/WMfnnC\/upload_68Lhu2-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/WMfnnC\/upload_68Lhu2-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:33","updateDate":"2015-12-16 10:52:11","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":112,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Light American Wheat Ale or Lager with Yeast","shortName":"Wheat Ale","description":"This beer can be made using either ale or lager yeast.

The earliest section was completed in 1890 and was occupied by the Red Andrews Saloon and the Central House Hotel. It was built by August Tiedemann, a noted local builder and architect, for two Swedish brothers, \"Red\" Andrew Johnson and Axel Johnson. It largely served sailors of the Great Lakes during the booming days of logging in Western Michigan.\r\nIn 1892 a second structure with decorative cast iron columns was added.(Now, entrance to Sunset Bay Antiques.) It served as the lobby of the Central House Hotel and provided a dining room, upstairs parlor rooms and additional bedrooms.\r\nIn 1905 the final four storefronts were added to provide apartments for the employees of the recently completed Star Watch Case Co., then located on nearby Rath Street. The ground level store-fronts of the buildings have been used for a wide variety of trades over the past 120 plus years, including a butcher shop, a millinery, a theatorium, a dry cleaners, a hardware store, a clothing shop, various furniture stores, the State Liquor Control Commission store, a bicycle shop, the local headquarters for the National Maritime Union, and currently, Sunset Bay Antiques and Jamesport Brewing Company","website":"http:\/\/www.jamesportbrewingcompany.com\/","established":"2000","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/mJiBMs\/upload_j6RcX6-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/mJiBMs\/upload_j6RcX6-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/mJiBMs\/upload_j6RcX6-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/mJiBMs\/upload_j6RcX6-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/mJiBMs\/upload_j6RcX6-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:11:41","locations":[{"id":"nCojAV","name":"Main Brewpub","streetAddress":"410 James Street","locality":"Ludington","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49431","phone":"231-845-2522","website":"http:\/\/www.jamesportbrewingcompany.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Thu:\r\n11:30 am - 9:00 pm\r\n11:30 am - 10:00 pm\r\n\r\nFri - Sat:\r\n11:30 am - 10:00 pm\r\n11:30 am - 12:00 am\r\n\r\nSun:\t\r\n11:30 am - 9:00 pm\r\n12:00 pm - 10:00 pm","latitude":43.9523739,"longitude":-86.4478298,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"OlUvtJ","name":"Lazy Creek Wheat","nameDisplay":"Lazy Creek Wheat","abv":"5.5","styleId":112,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-01-21 19:53:54","updateDate":"2015-01-21 19:53:54","style":{"id":112,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Light American Wheat Ale or Lager with Yeast","shortName":"Wheat Ale","description":"This beer can be made using either ale or lager yeast.

We began as a herb farm, growing culinary and medicinal herbs for the garden center trade. \r\n \r\nOur herb farm, Sunflower Cottage, grows 120,000 potted herb plants each spring from seeds and cuttings to sell to other garden centers and to our own customers. \r\n \r\nIn the fall of 2012, we built our hops field.  After all, hops are the herbs that flavor beer.  Hops provide the bitter balance to the sweet malt that feeds yeast, which ferments beer.\r\n \r\nIn 2013 we began the process of creating an ordinance in Warren County to accomodate farm breweries.  By late spring, the process was complete and Backroom Brewery became the first farm brewery in the Northern Shenandoah Valley.\r\n \r\nOur first hop harvest in August of 2013 was bountiful.  We were brewing in small batches and planning our brewery construction.  In the spring of 2014 we began construction and finished our brewery building plus equipment installation by July of 2014. \r\n \r\nLife is good and we are living the dream. \r\n \r\nWe now have nearly 20 beer recipes approved by the State of VA. \r\n \r\nOur tasting room bustles and our scratch kitchen cranks out delicious dishes prepared with our own fresh herbs and farm grown produce in season.\r\n \r\nIn the spring , summer and fall, gardens abound, families enjoy the farm, the scenery, the corn hole, the labyrinth and chalk boards. Pets are welcome.\r\n \r\nWe host 3 annual events, The Virginia Herb Festival (June), BRB Hop Harvest Party (August) and BRB Holiday Market (November). \r\n \r\nYou are cordially invited to come and drink our beer, eat, play and spend some time.","website":"http:\/\/www.backroombreweryva.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BQFHyL\/upload_QcGVGX-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BQFHyL\/upload_QcGVGX-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BQFHyL\/upload_QcGVGX-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BQFHyL\/upload_QcGVGX-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BQFHyL\/upload_QcGVGX-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-04-18 17:05:13","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:07:46","locations":[{"id":"CEon99","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"150 Ridgemont Rd.","locality":"Middletown","region":"Virginia","postalCode":"22645","phone":"540-869-8482","latitude":38.9956004,"longitude":-78.2210269,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"nano","locationTypeDisplay":"Nano Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-04-18 17:05:13","updateDate":"2015-11-19 22:21:12","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
