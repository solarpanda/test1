By infusing regional and seasonal ingredients into the recipes handed down to her, she has skillfully adapted those traditional styles to create craft beers with a regional character, setting each distinctly apart from other microbrews.\r\n\r\nAll of our beers are produced in small, 15-barrel fermenters, allowing us to keep each batch small enough to maintain microbrew quality and a close attention to detail at all times. The results are craft beers that are approachable and distinctive, to be enjoyed by craft beer novices and enthusiasts alike.\r\n\r\nWe invite you to experience Miner Brewing for yourself, as we open our Tap Room in Hill City this fall 2013.

And those textbooks are right; especially about the 1791 part.\r\n\r\nToday, in Franklin County, Vermont, Army veteran Steve Gagner is honoring his home state and passion \u2013 brewing great beer \u2013 with 14th Star Brewing Co.\r\n\r\n14th Star is Steve\u2019s 1,200-square-foot nanobrewery on Lower Newton Street, in St. Albans City.\r\n\r\nNanobreweries make less than four-barrel batches, and as of your eyes hitting this paragraph, there are still less than 100 nanobreweries in America.\r\n\r\nWhat makes 14th Star stand out? Well, it\u2019s about the only brewery in Vermont that\u2019s located above Burlington. Period.\r\n\r\nBut that\u2019s not it. Not entirely.\r\n\r\nYou see \u2013 this is your beer. Oh, sure, Steve plans on starting you off with one-barrel batches of pale ale, brown ale, and Belgian white. There will be more, of course, but that\u2019s up to you. So tell Steve what style beer you want in your 14th Star growler at: steve@14thstarbrewing.com.\r\nOn our end, we are readying to open our doors. Our goal is this July. (Check out our Pint of Progress on our home page.)\r\n\r\nWe can\u2019t wait to watch you let your hair down and lift your glass, Vermont. We\u2019ll enjoy that.

We've grown steadily ever since. In 1996, we completed installation of a state-of-the art 250-barrel brewhouse, bringing our capacity to 220,000 barrels per year. In 1996, for the first time in our brewery\u2019s history we also installed a bottling line, capable of producing 500 bottles per minute. In 2008 we added six new 1500-barrel fermentation tanks that increased our capacity to 450,000 barrels per year, and added a new keg filling line capable of filling 300 kegs per hour.","website":"http:\/\/www.widmer.com\/","established":"1984","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/8wcv7h\/upload_61693P-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/8wcv7h\/upload_61693P-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/8wcv7h\/upload_61693P-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/8wcv7h\/upload_61693P-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/8wcv7h\/upload_61693P-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:13","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:02:38","locations":[{"id":"SgctbA","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"929 North Russell Street","locality":"Portland","region":"Oregon","postalCode":"97227","phone":"503-281-2437","website":"http:\/\/www.widmer.com\/","latitude":45.540795,"longitude":-122.675594,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1984","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:13","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"9beYI9","name":"Wailing Wench","nameDisplay":"Wailing Wench","description":"Dark and robust brewed in the style of a American strong ale, full bodied and screaming with hops.","abv":"8","glasswareId":5,"availableId":1,"styleId":32,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/9beYI9\/upload_4rYRSr-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/9beYI9\/upload_4rYRSr-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/9beYI9\/upload_4rYRSr-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:44:28","updateDate":"2015-12-16 04:02:51","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":32,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Amber\/Red Ale","shortName":"Amber","description":"American amber\/red ales range from light copper to light brown in color.
