With a lot of elbow grease, blind ambition and a little luck, the quest to create a community pub in Northwest Lower Michigan began to take shape.  The philosophy was to bring an appreciation of craft beer to the north with product education and creativity.  The process of appreciation through education we call beer liberation.\r\n\r\nToday Short\u2019s Brewing Company continues the effort to educate and liberate consumers.  We take pride in our hands on, mom and pop approach and the energy we put into the quality of our beer, food, staff, customers and facilities. We believe in the power of the smallness.   We intend on remaining a smaller, state wide beer distributor and focusing our energies close to home (the SBC Michigan stimulus package).

Brewed in small batches since 1989, Karl Strauss Amber remains San Diego\u2019s original session beer.\r\n\r\nKarl spent his life making beer. He believed that behind every beer recipe was an inspiration, and behind every pint was a story waiting to be told.
