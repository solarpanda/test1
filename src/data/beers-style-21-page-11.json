Beer was the mission, and liberation was the movement.  With a lot of elbow grease, blind ambition and a little luck, the quest to create a community pub in Northwest Lower Michigan began to take shape.  The philosophy was to bring an appreciation of craft beer to the north with product education and creativity.  The process of appreciation through education we call beer liberation.\r\n\r\nToday Short\u2019s Brewing Company continues the effort to educate and liberate consumers.  We take pride in our hands on, mom and pop approach and the energy we put into the quality of our beer, food, staff, customers and facilities. We believe in the power of the smallness.   We intend on remaining a smaller, state wide beer distributor and focusing our energies close to home (the SBC Michigan stimulus package).  Our goal is to get to a comfortable production volume, enjoy what we do and love life in Northern Michigan.","website":"http:\/\/www.shortsbrewing.com\/","established":"2004","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2016-02-04 14:44:21","locations":[{"id":"CzopCY","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"121 North Bridge Street","locality":"Bellaire","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49615","phone":"231-533-6622","website":"http:\/\/www.shortsbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sun - Thu: 11:00 am \u2013 11:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:00 am - 12:00 am","latitude":44.976269,"longitude":-85.210357,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2004","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"7Rog3M","name":"That\u2019s What I\u2019m Talkin\u2019 \u2019bout","nameDisplay":"That\u2019s What I\u2019m Talkin\u2019 \u2019bout","description":"Chocked full \u2018o organic rolled oats, chocolate malt and black malt for a black body and a mocha brown head.

He designed a plane and built it with $1800 fom his parents after they had mortgaged their home.  Anxious to try his new design, he promptly flew and crashed the plane, demolishing it.  He redesigned and successfully flew his plane, possibly making him the first person in Fort Wayne to fly on his own.  This earned him the name Birdboy.  After making a name for himself locally, Birdboy travelled the country and the world, all the while updating and refining his design.  He became a huge influence on aviation throughout the world, and Smith Field here in Fort Wayne is named after him. \r\n \r\nThrough Birdboy Brewing, we hope to embrace Birdboy's adventurous spirit by offering new and exciting choices in the local beer scene.","website":"http:\/\/www.birdboybrewing.com\/","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/y0Q23K\/upload_m9Pip2-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/y0Q23K\/upload_m9Pip2-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/y0Q23K\/upload_m9Pip2-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/y0Q23K\/upload_m9Pip2-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/y0Q23K\/upload_m9Pip2-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-01-15 14:46:42","updateDate":"2016-01-15 14:50:34","locations":[{"id":"cxmroT","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"210 E Collins Rd.","locality":"Fort Wayne","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"46825","phone":"260-579-5508","website":"http:\/\/www.birdboybrewing.com\/","latitude":41.1217689,"longitude":-85.1395111,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-01-15 14:53:57","updateDate":"2016-01-15 14:53:57","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"r3JDoT","name":"The Deep","nameDisplay":"The Deep","description":"Creamy goodness with accompanying roast.","abv":"5.2","ibu":"29","styleId":21,"isOrganic":"Y","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-05-15 13:37:05","updateDate":"2015-05-15 13:37:05","style":{"id":21,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Oatmeal Stout","shortName":"Oatmeal Stout","description":"Oatmeal stouts include oatmeal in their grist, resulting in a pleasant, full flavor and a smooth profile that is rich without being grainy.

We opened on March 25, 2011. The restaurant serves lunch and dinner with approximately 90 seats inside plus 35 seats of outside patio dining. We offer family friendly dining with a children\u2019s play area, as well as a private meeting room for business gatherings and presentations or private events, all within full view of our own brewery.  \r\n\r\nThe restaurant is very much \u201cfarm-to-fork,\u201d working closely with North Carolina pasture raised beef farmers supplying beef with no hormones added and antibiotic-free meat that we grind daily to make our hamburgers and all-beef hotdogs.  We work with other farmers growing vegetables such as tomatoes, cucumbers for pickles, and lettuce. The menu is streamlined with most items produced on-site including house made buns, sauerkraut and bacon. We use no artificial sweeteners, no high fructose corn syrup, and no hydrogenated oils.  We like to say we are like fine dining in a burger joint.  We make the mustard, the slaw, the pickles, the mayo, the aioli, the hotdogs, the relish, the...\r\n\r\nWe are also a full scale working brewery and brew our own beer.  We have up to eight beers on-tap at any given time creating fresh ales and lagers rotating seasonally throughout the year. We use just malt, hops, yeast and water to craft our beer, leaving out adjuncts and additives. We take wine seriously and feature farmer made, estate grown and bottled wines from around the world, which are served on-tap via the Enomatic self-serve wine-dispensing machine.\r\n\r\nCentral to Bull City Burger and Brewery\u2019s core values is sustainability; our attempt is to operate while leaving the smallest energy footprint possible.  Our long term goal is to become part of a cycle of energy with the restaurant playing an integral role in the farms we source. Grain left over from the brewing process will feed locally farmed pigs that provide pork bellies to make our bacon, and the fry oil will become bio-diesel to fuel vehicles.","website":"http:\/\/www.bullcityburgerandbrewery.com\/","established":"2011","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/visitor.r20.constantcontact.com\/manage\/optin\/ea?v=001qie9IeSPzo4U1KgkEFG5EQ%3D%3D","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/eu1cAn\/upload_OCIvTW-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/eu1cAn\/upload_OCIvTW-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/eu1cAn\/upload_OCIvTW-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/eu1cAn\/upload_OCIvTW-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/eu1cAn\/upload_OCIvTW-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:12:44","locations":[{"id":"vGotFH","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"107 East Parrish Street","extendedAddress":"Suite 105","locality":"Durham","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"27701","phone":"919-680-2333","website":"http:\/\/www.bullcityburgerandbrewery.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday - Thursday: 11:11am to 10pm\r\nFriday & Saturday:  11:11am to 11pm-ish\r\nClosed Sundays","latitude":35.995445,"longitude":-78.899939,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"ixCEZ2","name":"When in Doubt Oatmeal Stout","nameDisplay":"When in Doubt Oatmeal Stout","abv":"5.3","styleId":21,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-10-22 13:37:45","updateDate":"2012-10-22 13:37:46","style":{"id":21,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Oatmeal Stout","shortName":"Oatmeal Stout","description":"Oatmeal stouts include oatmeal in their grist, resulting in a pleasant, full flavor and a smooth profile that is rich without being grainy.

This is a medium- to full- bodied beer, with minimal fruity esters. Diacetyl should be absent or at extremely low levels. Original gravity range and alcohol levels are indicative of English tradition of oatmeal stout.","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"3.8","abvMax":"6","srmMin":"20","srmMax":"20","ogMin":"1.038","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.02","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:22:53"},"breweries":[{"id":"HW6qMZ","name":"Stamm Beer","nameShortDisplay":"Stamm Beer","website":"http:\/\/Stammbeer.com","mailingListUrl":"info@stammbeer.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/HW6qMZ\/upload_AhnT3A-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/HW6qMZ\/upload_AhnT3A-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/HW6qMZ\/upload_AhnT3A-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/HW6qMZ\/upload_AhnT3A-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/HW6qMZ\/upload_AhnT3A-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-04-12 19:49:47","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:07:35","locations":[{"id":"dNJVmE","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"\u041a\u0430\u043b\u0443\u0436\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0448., 94","locality":"\u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c","region":"\u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f","phone":"+7 (985) 265-15-15","isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"RU","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-04-16 19:20:53","updateDate":"2015-04-16 19:22:01","country":{"isoCode":"RU","name":"RUSSIAN FEDERATION","displayName":"Russian Federation","isoThree":"RUS","numberCode":643,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
