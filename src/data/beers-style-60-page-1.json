We strive to use unconventional ingredients, and we will proudly state what we put in our beers.","website":"http:\/\/www.thebruery.com\/","established":"2008","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/4MVtcc\/upload_5OYqW3-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/4MVtcc\/upload_5OYqW3-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/4MVtcc\/upload_5OYqW3-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/4MVtcc\/upload_5OYqW3-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/4MVtcc\/upload_5OYqW3-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:00:07","locations":[{"id":"st9day","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"715 Dunn Way","locality":"Placentia","region":"California","postalCode":"92870","phone":"714-996-6258","website":"http:\/\/www.thebruery.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Friday & Saturday: 4pm - 10pm\r\nSunday: 12pm - 6pm","latitude":33.8613833,"longitude":-117.8800107,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"eBLN8U","name":"Abaddon","nameDisplay":"Abaddon","abv":"10","styleId":60,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-02-29 18:57:21","updateDate":"2016-02-29 18:57:21","style":{"id":60,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Quadrupel","shortName":"Belgian Quad","description":"Quadrupels or \"Quads\" are characterized by the immense presence of alcohol and balanced flavor, bitterness and aromas.

Brad Lincoln first experienced craft beer while working as an accountant in Portland, OR. The two met during the winter of 2009 while attending the Siebel Institute and studying brewing science. After being immersed in beer for the better part of five months, the two graduated and shared a desire to open a brewery. This resulted in the Saison-focused brewery that is now Funkwerks, opening December 9, 2010.\r\n \r\nSaisons originated as Belgian farmhouse ales- brewed during winter months for the farm workers during the summer months. Usually having a dry profile and complex fruity aromas, Saisons today are brewed year-round and generally have a higher alcohol percentage than their original versions.\r\n \r\nFunkwerks\u2019 two flagship beers, Saison and Tropic King, are produced year round. Also brewed annually are four seasonals, a number of small experimental batches, and select barrel-aged releases. Funkwerks flagship Saison was awarded a gold medal at the 2012 Great American Beer Festival (GABF) and a silver medal in 2011. Deceit, a Belgian-Style golden strong ale, was also awarded a gold medal at the GABF in 2012. In addition to receiving two gold medals in 2012, the GABF named Funkwerks the 2012 Small Brewing Company of the Year.\r\n \r\nFunkwerks is located at 1900 East Lincoln Avenue in Fort Collins, Colorado. The tasting room- complete with an indoor bar, retail area and spacious outdoor, dog-friendly patio- is open 7 days a week: Sunday through Thursday from 12pm-8pm; Friday and Saturday from 12pm-9pm. Brewery tours are given Saturdays at 2pm.\r\n \r\nFunkwerks is currently distributed in:\r\nColorado:\r\nC.R.

There are plenty of explanations about the origins of these names like double fermented (which makes no sense) or triple the alcohol (makes more sense) or quadruple malt (might be on the right track). Regardless, the style follows this progression: a Trippel is bigger and stronger than a Dubbel, therefore a Quad should be bigger and stronger than a Trippel. Additionally, the flavor profile is different style by style.A Belgian \u201csingle\u201d can pretty much be anything, but often are light or pale in color (re: Belgian Pale Ale). A Dubbel is usually made with some roasted malts and dark cara-malts making it darker in color. A Trippel is usually very light in color (like the narrowly exampled \u201csingle\u201d) and high in alcohol. So lets consider a Quad to be a Double Dubbel \u2013 ours with the added twist of a generous addition of (real) red tart cherries. The color is amber with some red hues and it also holds a nice rich head. The aroma will be distinctively Belgian in character. You will notice lots of fruit like esters and some roasted malt undertones.  The body is full with bread-like maltiness and a bit of a lingering caramel sweetness. As the beer finishes you will get a slight balancing bitterness and then an alcohol warming effect.","abv":"10.3","styleId":60,"isOrganic":"Y","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-06-30 19:17:21","updateDate":"2015-06-30 19:17:21","style":{"id":60,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Quadrupel","shortName":"Belgian Quad","description":"Quadrupels or \"Quads\" are characterized by the immense presence of alcohol and balanced flavor, bitterness and aromas.

Way back in 1988, Luch Scremin was a Freshman in college and became interested in brewing his own beer.  Since the internet did not exist, Luch was forced to order a \u201cbeer kit\u201d from an ad in the back of an issue of Popular Mechanics.  Suffice it to say that what resulted was indeed beer but was far from great.\r\n\r\nFast forward twenty years and the love of beer and the desire to brew it had matured over years of home brewing and an insatiable appetite for delicious brew.  Luch traveled the world with his job in the airline business and was treated to many delicious beer styles and beer culture.  In 2008 while planning to open a beer bar and brewpub,  Luch met his future business partners Andy and Sean.  The three were soon making the business a reality.\r\n\r\nAll that was left was a name.  They soon decided they would name the brewery for Luch\u2019s 1962 Ford Fire Engine \u2013 after all, they just don\u2019t make them like that anymore.  It represents all that Engine 15 Brewing Co. is about. Camaraderie, old school know how, determination and a simple but serious dedication to the cause.\r\nAs of 2011, Engine 15 Brewing Co. has enjoyed success and was even voted best Pub and Brewpub  in Jacksonville by the Folio Weekly readers poll.  At Engine 15 Brewing Co. you\u2019ll find a friendly atmosphere where you can enjoy a dizzying array of beers, both brewed in house and imported from the far reaches of the globe, eat a tasty meal and even brew your own beer!\r\n\r\nEngine 15 \u2013 Eat, Drink, Brew!","website":"http:\/\/www.engine15.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/VajTuz\/upload_NgL0g3-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/VajTuz\/upload_NgL0g3-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/VajTuz\/upload_NgL0g3-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/VajTuz\/upload_NgL0g3-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/VajTuz\/upload_NgL0g3-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:18:54","locations":[{"id":"E6WUse","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1500 Beach Blvd","locality":"Jacksonville Beach","region":"Florida","postalCode":"32250","phone":"904-249-2337","website":"http:\/\/www.engine15.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Tue - Thu: 11:00 am - 11:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:00 am - 12:00 am\r\nSun: 11:00 am - 11:00 pm","latitude":30.287586,"longitude":-81.4081999,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"x57WKa","name":"COLOSSAL FOUR","nameDisplay":"COLOSSAL FOUR","description":"The Fourth in the COLOSSAL Anniversary series is appropriately a Belgian-Style Quad.\r\n\r\nCOLOSSAL FOUR is dark caramel in color.

That means Euopean styles, but with a slight Southern interpretation.\r\nThanks to Free the Hops and the change in Alabama's formerly restrictive beer laws, creativity in brewing has come to Alabama.\r\n\r\nAt Yellowhammer, head brewer Keith Yager draws inspiration from both Belgian and German brewing traditions. An accomplished home brewer since 1995, Yager has designed numerous seasonal and specialty batches, from the Dark Hammer Belgian Quad to the UberAlt sticke ale. Other recurring ales are more experimental, blending styles, as with Tobacco Road, an imperial amber designed to complement a good cigar, or the occasional Lonesome Hop series, which spotlights the character of an individual hop. Yellowhammer is Yager's first commercial undertaking.\r\n\r\nYellowhammer Brewing opened on Oct. 16, 2010 with the best-selling Belgian white ale and the IPA. Other staples sold throughout the year include a German style altbier and the Miracle Worker, a potent Belgian tripel.","website":"http:\/\/www.yellowhammerbrewery.com\/","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BI8mE7\/upload_Kf31WU-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BI8mE7\/upload_Kf31WU-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BI8mE7\/upload_Kf31WU-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BI8mE7\/upload_Kf31WU-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BI8mE7\/upload_Kf31WU-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:13","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:23:20","locations":[{"id":"4V6C7Y","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2406 Clinton Avenue","locality":"West Huntsville","region":"Alabama","postalCode":"35805","phone":"256-975-5950","website":"http:\/\/www.yellowhammerbrewery.com\/","latitude":34.722525,"longitude":-86.603703,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2010","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:13","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
