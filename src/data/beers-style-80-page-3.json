This type of lager beer has a subtle malt sweetness, balanced by the earthy tones of noble German Hallertauer hops.\r\n\r\nThe Rock is a story unique to Milwaukee and our freshwater coast. As part of the drinking water system for the city, the system draws from a big pipe in the Lake. The \u201cintake\u201d was marked by a big structure that was prominent off the Bradford Beach shoreline. Because of the privacy (in plain view!)the Rock was a popular lookout point for ambitious suitors. In the exciting free love days of the early \u201970\u2032s, a few ambitious Milwaukeeans paddled out to the Rock and memorialized the sentiment of the time.\r\n\r\nThe original version of Love Rock known as \u201cWinter Lager\u201d happens to be the second batch of beer brewer at our second street location, it was brewed on November 27th 2007. We have made a few adjustments to the recipe over the years, just to the body and to the color. The Love Rock is Milwaukee Brewing\u2019s first year round production lager. The cold, long fermentation process that helps create such a smooth flavor. This recipe is pretty straight forward with the malts and two hop varieties. The Vienna style malt adds a nice toasty quality without overwhelming the beer. Our yeast guy tells us that this lager strain happens to be quite old. Many of the the major breweries in Milwaukee did, and still do, use this yeast. Love Rock is a refreshing and simple beer.","abv":"4.8","ibu":"18","glasswareId":4,"availableId":1,"styleId":80,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/ib0oBd\/upload_Ai5jvd-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/ib0oBd\/upload_Ai5jvd-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/ib0oBd\/upload_Ai5jvd-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","originalGravity":"1.051","createDate":"2012-09-09 13:18:44","updateDate":"2015-12-16 18:02:34","glass":{"id":4,"name":"Pilsner","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":80,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Vienna-Style Lager","shortName":"Vienna Lager","description":"Beers in this category are reddish brown or copper colored.

The common thread that binds all of Penn\u2019s beers together, however, is exceptional quality and craftsmanship.  We produce all of our brews in the classic, old-world way, without taking any shortcuts. We use copper kettles for optimal heat control. We employ double-decoction grain mashing to release fuller flavor in our lagers.  And we lager all of our beers in horizontal tanks for a cleaner, crisper finish. \r\n\r\nPenn Brewery is housed in the mid-nineteenth century landmark E&O Brewery building and is one of only a handful of working breweries with original beer caves still on premise.  And with our commitment to brewing the old-world way, we like to say that here at Penn Brewery, the tradition of our lagering caves lives on.","website":"http:\/\/www.pennbrew.com\/","established":"1986","mailingListUrl":"sandy@pennbrew.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/a9egNb\/upload_ghDyOg-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/a9egNb\/upload_ghDyOg-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/a9egNb\/upload_ghDyOg-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/a9egNb\/upload_ghDyOg-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/a9egNb\/upload_ghDyOg-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:05","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:54:23","locations":[{"id":"G1Jsyq","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"800 Vinial St.","locality":"Pittsburgh","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"15212","phone":"412-237-9400","website":"http:\/\/www.pennbrew.com\/","latitude":40.4567765,"longitude":-79.9913373,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1848","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:05","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
