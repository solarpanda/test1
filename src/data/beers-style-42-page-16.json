Available only on draft, \"Obamagang\" is being shipped out to dozens of enthusiastic bars and restaurants for celebrants and beer lovers in Washington DC (we hope Mr. President will have a glass!), Baltimore, Philadelphia, Boston, Chicago and a few cities in Upstate NY. The beer itself is a dark ale close to a stout, but hinting at a porter. At 6.2% and full of robust roasted malt and chocolate flavors, \"Obamagang\" is fortifying yet highly drinkable. Using the Ommegang house yeast and just a touch of Belgian Kriek, an underlying fruitiness adds to a full-bodied and well-rounded celebratory ale.","availableId":3,"styleId":42,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/VOKB4z\/upload_AjA8Fn-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/VOKB4z\/upload_AjA8Fn-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/VOKB4z\/upload_AjA8Fn-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:48","updateDate":"2016-03-18 18:52:17","available":{"id":3,"name":"Not Available","description":"Beer is not available."},"style":{"id":42,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Stout","shortName":"American Stout","description":"Initial low to medium malt sweetness with a degree of caramel, chocolate and\/or roasted coffee flavor with a distinctive dryroasted bitterness in the finish.

The two dreamed of starting a Brewpub that offered many varieties of house-brewed ales and lagers and hearty made-from-scratch pub fare to accompany the beers. The original Downtown location opened in November 1994 and expanded with the addition of a pool hall in 1996. The wild success of the first Great Dane led to the decision to open more pubs in the Madison area.\r\n\r\nThe Fitchburg Great Dane began operations in 2002 and the Hilldale pub followed in 2006. In 2009, the Hilldale pub expanded its brewery and opened a 4,000 square foot pool hall. Additionally, in May of 2009, the first Great Dane outside of the Madison area debuted in Wausau, Wisconsin. The Wausau Great Dane added a 100 seat beer garden and outdoor bar in the spring of 2011. In November 2010, the fifth Great Dane began operations in Grandview commons, off of Cottage Grove Road on Madison's east side.","website":"http:\/\/www.greatdanepub.com\/","established":"1996","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/www.greatdanepub.com\/email-list-signup","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/fonllb\/upload_6QtrPl-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/fonllb\/upload_6QtrPl-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/fonllb\/upload_6QtrPl-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/fonllb\/upload_6QtrPl-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/fonllb\/upload_6QtrPl-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:47:09","locations":[{"id":"IdIInN","name":"Fitchburg","streetAddress":"2980 Cahill Main","locality":"Fitchburg","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"53711","phone":"608-442-9000","website":"http:\/\/fitchburg.greatdanepub.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday- Thursday 11AM-2AM, Friday-Saturday 11AM-230AM, Sunday 10AM-2AM","latitude":43.0177229,"longitude":-89.423194,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"restaurant","locationTypeDisplay":"Restaurant\/Ale House","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"ux16wo","name":"Downtown","streetAddress":"123 E.

Linus and Lila Hall moved to Nashville from Mississippi in 1996, with Linus going to work as a tire engineer for Bridgestone and Lila as a curator for the Parthenon. Trying to make tires more round proved to be less fulfilling than making great beer, so with the encouragement of Lila, Linus quit his job, got a business degree from Vanderbilt and a craft-brewing education through a course at the American Brewer's Guild, and did an internship under Garrett Oliver at Brooklyn Brewery. Linus found a used 10 bbl brewing system from a brewpub in Iowa that had gone out of business, and went to work restoring a corner of the old Marathon Motorworks building for their brewery. Yazoo Brewing opened for business in Oct 2003, and quickly gained an enthusiastic local following.","website":"http:\/\/www.yazoobrew.com\/","established":"2003","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gUJBgl\/upload_Gxo9kQ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gUJBgl\/upload_Gxo9kQ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gUJBgl\/upload_Gxo9kQ-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gUJBgl\/upload_Gxo9kQ-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gUJBgl\/upload_Gxo9kQ-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:13","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:03:13","locations":[{"id":"preZog","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"910 Division St","locality":"Nashville","region":"Tennessee","postalCode":"37203","phone":"615-891-4649","website":"http:\/\/www.yazoobrew.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Thu:  4:00pm - 8:00pm\nFri:  4:00pm - 8:00pm\nSat:  2:00pm - 8:00pm\nWed:  4:00pm - 6:00pm\n\nWednesday are Growler fills only","latitude":36.1509754,"longitude":-86.7821302,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2003","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:13","updateDate":"2014-08-23 15:00:53","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"atrXOn","name":"Opera Cream","nameDisplay":"Opera Cream","abv":"5.5","styleId":42,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-12-07 14:30:59","updateDate":"2015-12-07 14:31:00","style":{"id":42,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Stout","shortName":"American Stout","description":"Initial low to medium malt sweetness with a degree of caramel, chocolate and\/or roasted coffee flavor with a distinctive dryroasted bitterness in the finish.

We are committed to the continued growth and revitalization of our neighborhood by being an interactive and supportive partner to the arts and business communities, as well as the burgeoning craft beer movement in Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nAngel City Brewing was founded in 1997. Starting modestly, Angel City quickly became a leader in the LA craft beer scene. In 2004 Angel City bought an 8,000 barrel German-made brewery in Alpine Village near Los Angeles on EBay! and lovingly restored the facility. In late 2010, Angel City relocated the brewery to the historic John A. Roebling Building in LA\u2019s Downtown Arts District. The vision was, and remains, to give this great city a great brewery.\r\n\r\nOn January 5, 2012, Angel City Brewery was acquired by Alchemy & Science, a craft beer collaboration led by Alan Newman and Stacey Steinmetz, formerly of Magic Hat Brewing Company.\r\n\r\nSince January 2012, we\u2019ve undergone massive renovations, including the addition of a new mustache bar. We began brewing in April of 2012, and started popping up in local LA bars and restaurants soon thereafter.\r\n\r\nIn February 2013, we opened the doors to the Brewery and Public House, but with limited hours as construction continued. We offer an ever-rotating selection of Angel City beer on tap, which includes a number of beers exclusively available at the Brewery. In addition to pints and flights, we offer brewery tours, events, and a great place to gather with friends. We have a small on-site retail store as well. Outside food is always welcome, and there are a number of great locations in our neighborhood that offer take out. In addition to the neighborhood cuisine, our parking lot has become a hot spot for food trucks, with one parked outside nearly every night we\u2019re open. On May 5th, 2013 we had our grand opening with our first ever Heritage Festival. We\u2019re now seven days a week for brewery tours and tastings, and we have full roster of weekly events.","website":"http:\/\/www.angelcitybrewing.com\/","established":"1997","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0ZIlVA\/upload_q87thj-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0ZIlVA\/upload_q87thj-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0ZIlVA\/upload_q87thj-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0ZIlVA\/upload_q87thj-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0ZIlVA\/upload_q87thj-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:15:22","locations":[{"id":"5tw2Iw","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"216 S Alameda St","locality":"Los Angeles","region":"California","postalCode":"90013","phone":"310-329-8881","website":"http:\/\/www.angelcitybrewing.com\/","latitude":34.0466054,"longitude":-118.2378181,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1997","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"ec3q8i","name":"Orchid Repose","nameDisplay":"Orchid Repose","abv":"6.7","styleId":42,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-03-16 17:27:23","updateDate":"2016-03-16 17:27:23","style":{"id":42,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Stout","shortName":"American Stout","description":"Initial low to medium malt sweetness with a degree of caramel, chocolate and\/or roasted coffee flavor with a distinctive dryroasted bitterness in the finish.

From a funky storefront on the famous Pacific Coast Highway the duo ran the \u201cPizza Port\u201d with a classic menu of pizza and chicken wings to which they added their own \u201cSan Diego\u201d twist.  The Original Pizza Port in Solana Beach\r\n\r\nThe parking was limited and the building crowded with simple hand-built picnic tables and a hodge-podge d\u00e9cor of surf-related paraphernalia almost at odds with the sophisticated flavors of the food. But word spread quickly and it wasn\u2019t long before Pizza Port was a local favorite. \r\n\r\nEarly on Vince took advantage of free space in the restaurant\u2019s storage area to dabble with home brewing. The hobby took off and he was eventually brewing more than could reasonably be consumed at home. So at the urging of friends and fans, the Vince and Gina decided to go into the brewpub business. Pizza Port offered its first craft-brewed beers to patrons in 1992. \r\n\r\nEmbracing the same \u201cflavor-driven\u201d principles that had made the pizza menu so popular, Pizza Port quickly gained a reputation in San Diego\u2019s nascent craft beer scene. In 1997 the company opened a second location a few miles north of Solana Beach in Carlsbad, and a third in 2003 in San Clemente. The same year San Clemente opened (as well as the year after), the original location in Solana Beach won Great American Beer Festival \u201cSmall Brewpub of the Year\u201d. \r\n\r\nThe Pizza Port family\u2019s reputation for great foods and craft beer continued to grow, making them landmarks not just for Southern Californians, but for beer lovers from around the world. In 2008 they opened a premium bottle shop with more that 600 craft beers adjacent to the Carlsbad locations, and by the end of the first decade of the 21st century, the Pizza Ports were a brewing dynasty. In 2009 the Pizza Ports won a staggering 9 medals at the 2009 Great American Beer Festival and Pizza Port Carlsbad was named \u201cLarge Brewpub of the Year\u201d.","website":"http:\/\/www.pizzaport.com\/","established":"1987","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QSVVxD\/upload_g7L5OH-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QSVVxD\/upload_g7L5OH-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QSVVxD\/upload_g7L5OH-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QSVVxD\/upload_g7L5OH-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QSVVxD\/upload_g7L5OH-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:10:31","locations":[{"id":"DrFlD0","name":"Carlsbad","streetAddress":"571 Carlsbad Village Dr.","locality":"Carlsbad","region":"California","postalCode":"92008","phone":"760-720-7007","website":"http:\/\/www.pizzaport.com\/locations\/carlsbad\/","latitude":33.1596505,"longitude":-117.3478111,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1997","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"qAyZMR","name":"Solana Beach","streetAddress":"135 N.

Further releases have included the 12 oz Resin and 3Beans, as well as 16oz seasonal offerings such as Apollo and Autumnation.","website":"http:\/\/www.sixpoint.com\/","established":"2004","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/sixpoint.com\/connect","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/7VPQrN\/upload_zewnMi-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/7VPQrN\/upload_zewnMi-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/7VPQrN\/upload_zewnMi-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/7VPQrN\/upload_zewnMi-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/7VPQrN\/upload_zewnMi-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:58:11","locations":[{"id":"QJRQhZ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"40 Van Dyke St","locality":"Brooklyn","region":"New York","postalCode":"11231","website":"http:\/\/www.sixpoint.com\/","latitude":40.6739685,"longitude":-74.0119553,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2005","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2015-08-19 18:36:16","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"o9Uk5X","name":"Out Of Bounds Stout","nameDisplay":"Out Of Bounds Stout","description":"This big, roasty stout takes flavor to the extreme.

The yin\/yang of our brewing philosophy is hoppy\/sessionable and we aim to brew beers where \u201cthe first sip calls for the third\u201d.  We\u2019re a small team with big dreams and tend to smile while we sweat. We brew those styles which are most compelling to our thirst and we certainly hope you enjoy our brews as much as we do.\r\n\r\nRhinegeist means \u201cghost of the Rhine\u201d, and refers to our place here in the historic Brewery District in the Over the Rhine neighborhood of Cincinnati. At the turn of the century, this neighborhood was home to nearly 45,o00 inhabitants, most of them of German descent and 38 breweries. We hope to engender the spirit of camaraderie and hard work that we imagine those living and brewing in this neighborhood at that time embodied.\r\n\r\nWe self distribute our beer, which means each beer that you drink in a bar or restaurant is poured from a keg that we delivered cold in our refrigerated van (keep your eyes peeled for it around town). We like to keep beer as fresh as possible, which means that every keg we fill is immediately moved into cold storage where it sits until we load it onto our refrigerated van for delivery to the coldbox of each local account. Fresh beer is tasty beer, and that\u2019s our favorite kind.","website":"http:\/\/rhinegeist.com","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0s8yID\/upload_aZOo67-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0s8yID\/upload_aZOo67-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0s8yID\/upload_aZOo67-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0s8yID\/upload_aZOo67-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0s8yID\/upload_aZOo67-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-06-22 18:23:27","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:43:57","locations":[{"id":"202T0m","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1910 Elm St","locality":"Cincinnati","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45202","phone":"(513) 381-1356","website":"http:\/\/rhinegeist.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Thursday 4pm - 11pm\r\nFriday 4pm - 12am\r\nSaturday 12pm - 12am\r\nSunday 12pm - 7pm","latitude":39.1168193,"longitude":-84.5201739,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-06-22 18:26:59","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"bXHPpu","name":"Pass Stout","nameDisplay":"Pass Stout","abv":"8","ibu":"45","glasswareId":5,"styleId":42,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-03-20 13:06:16","updateDate":"2014-10-20 19:32:59","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"style":{"id":42,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Stout","shortName":"American Stout","description":"Initial low to medium malt sweetness with a degree of caramel, chocolate and\/or roasted coffee flavor with a distinctive dryroasted bitterness in the finish.

Not this time around.\r\n \r\nA brewer slowly climbed from the lowest points of business life with a sore ass, as he ascended to a new level. Hark! The horse of the dark nature holds the scales where the wheat and barley feedeth, not taketh from the mouths of man. A non-filtered view of hard work, careful perseverance of expansion, sticking to what is believed to be the right way and the only way to stay true to high quality, and also, the vague understandings of possible humor; blurring his family\u2019s, employees\u2019 and customers\u2019 drinking experience and vision between a no-bullshit approach to brewing big, outstanding beers and selling nonsensical imagery and haberdashery\u2026Proven to the masses as a Darkhorse trademark for the man behind the reigns.\r\n \r\nCan true patrons of quality, time and devotion deal with the inner workings of a mad-man\u2019s psyche as he speaks of visions of smacking Umpa Lumpas with snow shovels, or allows the obscure drawings of lawn jarts and tinker toys to be hung on the walls of his establishment? They seem to\u2026A madman\u2019s passion for brewing comes out in strange ways indeed; where his employees and fellow brew house boys may know not how to deal with his tongue twisted ramblings and contortions of the face at first; where the same can definitely scare away newcomers.\r\n \r\nTrue patrons know how to accept the obscure humor. Some have lent a hand in some way or another. They know what \u201cpour to the line\u201d means; they have been to every annual crawfish boil and some find the passion within themselves to put the Darkhorse name to skin\u2026still they barely understand the immature drawings created in the brewery\u2026 True patrons know the hard work the brewers put in to create and keep the Darkhorse name in the lead.\r\n \r\nSome things in life are easily read and some things keep you guessing. Should we take turns consuming garage sale items and vomiting them on the walls or should we follow the square, straight and narrow? Slip into the pub and look around. Go out and buy a six-pack, and read the holder the beer comes in. Read the back of your growler. When you\u2019re done, you\u2019ll either get it or you won\u2019t.
