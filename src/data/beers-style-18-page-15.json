Unlike others that brew \u201cPale Ale Style\u201d  Our beer is brewed on an Authentic British Pale Ale Brew House using the finest English Pale Ale Malt, American Hops and Yeast.  I have been brewing American Pale Ales since 1982, back in the days when I brewed 20 Liters at a time as a homebrewer.  Today I brew 2000 Liters at a time (more friends then back then).  I grew up in Northern California during the Microbrewery Revolution and you will taste that in my beers. Of course I never pasteurize our beers or add anything artificial.  Trust me when I say, Beer coming from Pf\u00e4ffikon to your dinner table will taste fresher than beer brought in a container traveling 2 months over the ocean.  Don\u2019t just take our word for it, Biergenuss Magazine calls us \u201cThe Rothschild of Beer\u201d. Thanks to all of you for making Western Rider the number one selling Pale Ale in Switzerland. Unlike many other brands, we are not brewed in Germany or in another Kanton and then sold as a \u201cLocal\u201d or \u201cSwiss Beer\u201d. We are also not a big beer factory, owned by a European neighbor.  With every Sudwerk Beer, you are enjoying an Authentic Pale Ale produced here in Switzerland, by a family owned and operated \u201cKleinbrauerei\u201d\/Microbrewery. With every Sudwerk Beer, you enjoy the true meaning of Swiss Quality and the results of good old fashioned hard work.  You can find us in larger COOP Stores in the German and French speaking parts of Switzerland, on the Bahnhofstrasse in Jelmoli, Rio Getr\u00e4nke, Drinks of the World as well as in over 100 Restaurants and Hotels. In Z\u00fcrich, we are distributed by Heineken Distribution, Intercomestibles AG and Schatt Getr\u00e4nke. Quality without compromise. If you are ever in the neighborhood, come by and visit us!

We produce high quality craft beer in a variety of flavors, and feature a tap room on site where locals and visitors come to view brewery operations while enjoying a pint and possibly some chow. We opened for business in the Fall of 2013, and our beer is currently on tap in many fine establishments across Wyoming.

They spent many long nights building brewing equipment by hand and coming up with tasty recipes.  More than twenty years later, the long nights and quest for great beer has continued, but on a much larger scale.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 2000, Cascade Lakes Brewing Company was purchased by Rick Orazetti and Doug Kutella.  Ron Kutella and Chris Justema soon joined the partnership. What started as a small brewing facility in an airport industrial zone has turned into a state-of-the-art, 25-barrel brew house system that allows brewing 775 gallons per batch, three times daily. The partners also expanded from just a brewery to having four local pubs: 7th Street Brew House, Tumalo Tavern, Cascade West Grub and Alehouse, and our flagship restaurant in Bend, Cascade Lakes Lodge. Cascade Lakes beer is now distributed and sold in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho.\r\n\r\nCascade Lakes brews six beers year-round: Blonde Bombshell, 20\u201d Brown, Paddleboard Porter, Hopsmack IPA, Mosaic IPA, and Cyclops IPA. They brew many seasonals throughout the year including: Snow Park XPA, Slippery Slope, Skookum Creek Ale, Paulina Lake Pilsner, Waste Deep Weiss, Riverside Red, Silverback Imperial Stout, Kolsch, IRA, etc. Look for our beers on draft at your favorite pub and grab a six-pack at your local grocery store.\r\n\r\nPHIL BREY \u2013 HEAD BREWER\r\nPhil brings 25 years of winemaking and brewing experience to Cascade Lakes Brewing Co. Phil started home brewing in college while working on his degree in Enology (winemaking) at Fresno State. Phil started with some winemaking stints in California at Mirassou Winery and Bogle Vineyards before moving to Bend. He began his professional brewing career at Deschutes Brewery. After some time over in the valley making wine at Benton-Lane Winery and Spindrift Cellars, and brewing at Oregon Trail Brewery, Phil returned to the High Desert to brew at Cascade Lakes, where he has worked since 2010. When Phil isn\u2019t producing some sort of alcohol, he can be found mountain biking, hiking, gardening and spending time with family.","website":"http:\/\/cascadelakes.com\/","established":"1994","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/sIBGId\/upload_2VG3hV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/sIBGId\/upload_2VG3hV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/sIBGId\/upload_2VG3hV-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/sIBGId\/upload_2VG3hV-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/sIBGId\/upload_2VG3hV-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:50","updateDate":"2016-06-23 18:22:00","locations":[{"id":"O2ScDy","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2141 SW First Street","locality":"Redmond","region":"Oregon","postalCode":"97756","phone":"541-923-3110","website":"http:\/\/cascadelakes.com\/","latitude":44.256031,"longitude":-121.169251,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1994","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:50","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"C7u6RO","name":"7th Street Brew House","streetAddress":"855 SW 7th Street","locality":"Redmond","region":"Oregon","postalCode":"97756","phone":"541-923-1795","website":"http:\/\/cascadelakes.com\/pubs\/7th-street\/","hoursOfOperation":"Open Sunday \u2013 Thursday 11:30 am \u2013 10:00 pm\r\nFriday- Saturday 11:30 am \u2013 11:00 am","latitude":44.2687763,"longitude":-121.1757063,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"restaurant","locationTypeDisplay":"Restaurant\/Ale House","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-10-23 14:05:35","updateDate":"2016-07-03 15:46:44","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"oRcuap","name":"Cascade Lakes Lodge","streetAddress":"1441 SW Chandler Ave Suite 100","locality":"Bend","region":"Oregon","postalCode":"97702","phone":"541-388-4998","website":"http:\/\/www.cascadelakes.com\/pubs\/lodge\/","hoursOfOperation":"Open 11:30 am -10:00 pm seven days a week.","latitude":44.0414862,"longitude":-121.3329318,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"restaurant","locationTypeDisplay":"Restaurant\/Ale House","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2004","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-10-23 14:06:49","updateDate":"2016-06-24 12:35:50","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"QlLikG","name":"Tumalo Tavern","streetAddress":"64670 Stricker #103","locality":"Bend","region":"Oregon","postalCode":"97701","phone":"541.330.2323","website":"http:\/\/www.cascadelakes.com\/pubs\/tumalo-tavern\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  11:00am -

We had fun and we still have Silver City Guests ask us about 39 cent hamburgers and grilled onion burgers. We miss 'em too, but we proved it's real hard to put the big hamburger chains out of business. It isn't as easy as it looks.\r\n\r\nIn 1996 we decided to switch gears and get into the Brewpub business. We sold our Bremerton location and remodeled the Silverdale location into what it is today.\r\n\r\nWe operate today on the same principles as we did when we opened our first Top Notch Burger. We work hard at making sure each Guest leaves happier than when they arrived.

The Bethlehem Steel plant had been shutting down slowly for years \u2013 a dying industrial giant of a bygone day \u2013 and the region was suffering the loss hard. The downtown had also been bled by the malls and box stores that promised savings to the consumer in exchange for genuine local culture and community. Yet on April 15th, 1998, the same day the the historic Hotel Bethlehem declared bankruptcy and closed, the Bethlehem Brew Works optimistically opened its doors to the public at the corner of Main and Broad Streets. The one other restaurant in the neighborhood closed the following week.\r\n\r\nBethlehem Brew Works chose to ignore the public exodus, and instead celebrated the history of \u2018Steel\u2019 and paid tribute to the region\u2019s working class culture in it\u2019s decor and menu. The Fegley\u2019s believed a transformation was already well underway, and would grow with the city as it came to life. Over the course of a dozen years, the family became more involved in the community, and worked with the downtown shop owners to strengthen the downtown. One by one, new restaurants began open, and stores began to keep longer hours to accommodate the growing crowds. Historic Bethlehem now is home to a burgeoning restaurant row and retail shops of all kinds.\r\n2002\r\n\r\nMost importantly, the restaurant and brewery grew as well. The Steelgaarden lounge was added, and quickly became a Valley hotspot, and a few years later, the lounge exanded again, annexing another two shop spaces for more nightlife and event space. The kitchen also tripled in size with new space, and the brewery added additional tanks to keep up with the demand for the brews.\r\n2005\r\n\r\nWith an eye still on things to come, the family looked west into Allentown. Opportunity was difficult to see in a city who\u2019s retail heyday had ended some years before with the departure of Hess\u2019s department store. But the optimistic Fegleys became smitten with the history of the \u201cQueen city\u201d \u2013 from it\u2019s role in the War of Independence, to the great silk industry that supplied the world\u2019s fashions, and the great retail era the followed. \u201cThe All-American City\u201d as it was known, seemed to be frosted over \u2013 and the Fegleys believed it was about to thaw.\r\n2007\r\n\r\nIn June 2007, years in the making, the Allentown Brew Works opened on Hamilton Street, housed inside the historic Harold\u2019s Furniture Building. Proud to be part of another resurging downtown, the 400 seat restaurant is a testament to the vibrant heartbeat that thrives in the city. Offering two and a half levels of dining, plus state-of-the-art banquet facilities in The Hamilton Room, and multiple bars offering different atmospheres, as well as an outdoor casual patio, Der Biergarten and a new seductive lower level lounge, Silk. The 15-barrel brewery in the Allentown location boasts seven fermentation tanks and eight serving tanks \u2013 built with capacity to add a bottling line and begin outside sales of Fegley\u2019s Brew Works in earnest.\r\n2008\r\n\r\nIn 2008, the Philadelphia Phillies AAA team, the Iron Pigs, opened the new Coca-Cola Park stadium, and added Fegley\u2019s Brew Works to its lineup. With that account in place, and a new sales team behind the brewery sales, Fegley\u2019s Brew Works can now be found at almost 200 locations in the region from Harrisburg to central New Jersey, north to Scranton, and south to Philadelphia where it is very popular.\r\n2010\r\n\r\nOne of the nation\u2019s leading beer writers and co-founder of Philly Beer Week, Don Russell (aka Joe Sixpack), named Hop\u2019Solutely the Beer of the Year.\r\n\r\nBecoming supportive and active in the Allentown community, during their first few years the Brew Works saw eateries come and go. In 2010, the tide seemed to change with major restaurants adding to the draw of the city. For some time, the Fegleys had been constantly thinking up good ideas that they would love to see happen in the neighborhood, when it finally struck them that they should just do it themselves. In an effort to continue to move the Fegley brand toward healthy, sustainable \u201cgreen\u201d practices, they chose concepts that would fit that ideal.\r\n2011 to Present\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Fegley\u2019s brewery continues to be recognized as their Arctic Alchemy wins it\u2019s first bronze medal at the Great American Beer Festival and Blueberry Belch wins \u201cBest Summer Beer\u201d at the Philadelphia Summer Ale Festival at the Philadelphia Zoo . Arctic Alchemy goes on to win a gold medal at GABF in 2014 and the pubs continue to win Reader\u2019s Choice Awards and Best of the Valley Awards. View our complete awards list.\r\n\r\nWith the addition of a bottling line, and the growing success of outside accounts the brewery is closing in on it\u2019s capacity, and soon Fegley\u2019s will begin to nose their way to new opportunities. Perhaps there\u2019s another fragrant wallflower ready to dance.","website":"http:\/\/www.thebrewworks.com","established":"1998","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Rx4Dnt\/upload_N2X3bi-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Rx4Dnt\/upload_N2X3bi-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Rx4Dnt\/upload_N2X3bi-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Rx4Dnt\/upload_N2X3bi-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Rx4Dnt\/upload_N2X3bi-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:38:31","locations":[{"id":"Jio9R0","name":"Fegley's Allentown Brew Works","streetAddress":"812 W Hamilton St","locality":"Allentown","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"18101","phone":"610.433.7777","website":"http:\/\/www.thebrewworks.com\/allentown-brewworks\/","latitude":40.6013531,"longitude":-75.4739451,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1998","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2015-10-21 15:03:28","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"SAPoSh","name":"Fegley's Bethlehem Brew Works","streetAddress":"569 Main Street","locality":"Bethlehem","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"18018","phone":"610-882-1300","latitude":40.6222629,"longitude":-75.3821851,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-10-21 15:03:28","updateDate":"2015-10-21 15:03:28","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Mf1YvU","name":"Pay it Forward Cocoa Porter","nameDisplay":"Pay it Forward Cocoa Porter","description":"This fourth beer offered year round in cans is a celebration of malt.

Finally, curious beer drinkers are stepping out from under the mind-numbing barrage of large brewery advertising and deciding for themselves what they like. Our beers are designed for those curious drinkers. The large breweries use fillers in their beer; Corn or Rice are the most frequently used. Most good beer should be all Barley, in the same way that good hamburgers are all beef. Barley is expensive and the more fillers that are used, the better the profits! Cricket Hill Beers are 100% Barley as are most great beers. Please take the time to taste different local beers. I am certain that those who decide not to let television dictate what they drink are ready for a wonderful adventure into the world of Beer!","website":"http:\/\/www.crickethillbrewery.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/U0vh9j\/upload_ZgAQjj-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/U0vh9j\/upload_ZgAQjj-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/U0vh9j\/upload_ZgAQjj-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/U0vh9j\/upload_ZgAQjj-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/U0vh9j\/upload_ZgAQjj-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:43:54","locations":[{"id":"ecNEQD","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"24 Kulick Road","locality":"Fairfield","region":"New Jersey","postalCode":"07004","phone":"973-276-9415","website":"http:\/\/www.crickethillbrewery.com\/","latitude":40.872566,"longitude":-74.296359,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2014-09-26 13:18:56","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"V1O92b","name":"PB Porter","nameDisplay":"PB Porter","description":"Here's a neat twist-just enough peanut butter to give you a tickle.
