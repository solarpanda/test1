Just kidding!!\r\n\r\nTo make a long story short, Pete and Scot spent their formative years playing baseball at the West Middleton Town Hall.  Ever since, the words \"Town Hall\" evoke memories of community, relaxing with friends and happiness.  When Pete and Scot were reacquainted in Minneapolis they opened the Town Hall.\r\n\r\nTucked away on the fringes of downtown Minneapolis, the Town Hall offers a refreshing alternative to other eating and drinking establishments.  Its relaxed environment attracts a diverse crowd of college students, business people, professors, theater patrons and many more.\r\n\r\nThe Town Hall makes some of the best beer in America and provides an atmosphere where its patrons can relax and enjoy them.

Whole ingredients are used with traditional brewing equipment which is controlled by state of the art systems that manage temperature throughout the brewing process. These same systems harvest waste BTU's, capturing the energy that would normally be lost and reusing it to preheat ingredients, maintain product temperatures, and even heat the taproom via an in-floor heating system. Waste materials such as process water and spent grain are also captured and stored for fertilization and irrigation of our crops.\r\n\r\nThe prep table in the brewery quite often looks like the prep area in a fine restaurant. Fresh herbs, fruits and vegetables are a common sight, along with an amazing array of spices, roots and even flowers.
