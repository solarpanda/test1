They first met during graduate school at the University of Minnesota where the fates would have it, they joined the same chemistry research group.  The guys spent many a night proving the adage of their PhD (piled higher & deeper) advisor, \u201cThe true test of running a scientific instrument is being able to operate it after a few beers.\u201d  After graduation, Grant and Phil pursued different career paths, Grant went the academic route, while Phil initially started out in the chemical industry, but then wised up and conned people into hiring him as a beer then wine chemist.  After a few years of chasing the academic and corporate dollar, the boys wised up and decided to strike out on their own.  They landed in Vancouver, WA (which was the first Vancouver, by the way) and started up Dirty Hands Brewing Company.  From the start, their goal was to brew full flavored beers that were both balanced and highly drinkable.  So, they set to work, getting their hands dirty renovating the space that was the old Columbian Newspaper building to a working brewery and taproom.  Speaking of the newspaper, that\u2019s how the name came about.  Think of reading a hard copy paper and how your hands would look from getting newsprint all over them!  The brewery also strives to honor the working past of Vancouver and Washington state by using locally sourced ingredients in the beer and food that we serve.","website":"http:\/\/dirtyhandsbrewing.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ywrnRJ\/upload_Bm95vm-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ywrnRJ\/upload_Bm95vm-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ywrnRJ\/upload_Bm95vm-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ywrnRJ\/upload_Bm95vm-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ywrnRJ\/upload_Bm95vm-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-23 02:20:26","updateDate":"2016-06-08 20:01:30","locations":[{"id":"UfTXZT","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"114 E.

But what has surprised us most is that our local Yukoners have taken both of our flagship brands to heart (and to dinner, and to parties\u2026) and drank almost equivalent quantities of each! This speaks volumes for the apparent consumer cravings for beers with flavour, and Yukon Red is all about flavour.\r\n\r\nThe drink starts with by displaying a deep bronze colour, but the beer is crystal clear. The head is an abundant fine mousse (pronounced \u2018moose\u2019 for the cabin crowd), cream coloured and just spilling over the rim of the glass (if you got the good waitress, Yukon trained and all). As you raise the mug, your senses catch the fine aromas permeating from the glass, clean malty sweetness touched by spicy hop esters.\r\n\r\nThe first draw of the ale cools the parched lips and moistens the cheeks. Full malt body takes over the palate; not sweet, but bold, fruity and persistent. A snap of clean hop bitter grabs the back of the tongue and springs into the sinus cavity, blending with the caramel flavours that have wafted back with the nectar that is this ale. But the swallow goes down clean, almost dry, and leaves only a slight lingering presence of the abundant flavours that were just there, and now gone!\r\n\r\nMany more draws on the mug, many more mouth-filling flavour experiences, and always that clean finish, saying \u201cHow about another?!!\u201d.\r\n\r\nCan you tell that this is the head brewers favourite?

Curiosity eventually got the best of us, and we combined the two - our first batch of homebrew was conceived in the early 90's with home brewing equipment, books, and some ingredients handed down from our parent's home brewing days in the 70's.\r\n\r\nSince then we've learned a lot about brewing professionally. We developed easy drinking and well rounded beers with our own state of the art brewing equipment. We sold our first beer in October 2005 and now we're distributing throughout the Canaan Valley, Davis, Thomas, Elkins, Morgantown and Fayetteville.\r\n\r\nThat's our story so far. Thank you for all the great support we've received pursuing our dream.\r\n\r\n- Brian & Willie","website":"http:\/\/mountainstatebrewing.com\/","established":"2005","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/yJVm42\/upload_snFOTg-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/yJVm42\/upload_snFOTg-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/yJVm42\/upload_snFOTg-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/yJVm42\/upload_snFOTg-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/yJVm42\/upload_snFOTg-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:02","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:12:19","locations":[{"id":"DlWtXi","name":"Thomas","streetAddress":"1 Nelson Boulevard","locality":"Thomas","region":"West Virginia","postalCode":"26292","phone":"304-463-4500","website":"http:\/\/mountainstatebrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Thur-Fri 6pm-12am, \r\nSat 3pm-12am","latitude":39.140863,"longitude":-79.499701,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:02","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"trz33t","name":"Morgantown","streetAddress":"54 Clay Street","locality":"Morgantown","region":"West Virginia","postalCode":"26501","phone":"304-241-1976","website":"http:\/\/mountainstatebrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Open daily 11am to 11pm","latitude":39.62725,"longitude":-79.961366,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-07-16 17:05:13","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"WBhrDK","name":"Deep Creek Lake","streetAddress":"6690 Sang Run Road","locality":"McHenry","region":"Maryland","postalCode":"21541","phone":"301-387-3360","website":"http:\/\/mountainstatebrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon-Thur 11-9pm\r\nFri-Sat 11-10pm, Sun 11-9pm","latitude":39.564423,"longitude":-79.380326,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-07-16 17:06:07","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
