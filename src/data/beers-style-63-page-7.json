Often brewed with light colored Belgian \"candy\" sugar, these beers are well attenuated. The perception of hop bitterness is medium-low to medium -high, with hop flavor and aroma also in this range. These beers are highly attenuated and have a perceptively deceiving high alcoholic character-being light to medium bodied rather than full bodied. The intensity of malt character should be low to medium, often surviving along with a complex fruitiness. Very little or no diacetyl is perceived. Herbs and spices are sometimes used to delicately flavor these strong ales. Low levels of phenolic spiciness from yeast byproducts may also be perceived. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"50","abvMin":"7","abvMax":"11","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"10","ogMin":"1.064","fgMin":"1.012","fgMax":"1.024","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:32:16"},"breweries":[{"id":"lzCMme","name":"Brasserie de la Senne","nameShortDisplay":"Brasserie de la Senne","website":"http:\/\/www.brasseriedelasenne.be\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/lzCMme\/upload_1o9hJI-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/lzCMme\/upload_1o9hJI-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/lzCMme\/upload_1o9hJI-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/lzCMme\/upload_1o9hJI-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/lzCMme\/upload_1o9hJI-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:40:39","locations":[{"id":"bjwFtZ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Victor Nonnemansstraat 40a","locality":"Sint-Pieters-Leeuw","region":"Vlaams Brabant","phone":"32-0497-\/-93.23.75","latitude":50.785247,"longitude":4.2437811,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"BE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"BE","name":"BELGIUM","displayName":"Belgium","isoThree":"BEL","numberCode":56,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
