Founded in 1997 by longtime friends and co-workers Rick Dellow and Barry Benson (the \u2018R\u2019 & \u2018B\u2019, respectively), R&B Brewing Co. was set up to stand in opposition to what the beer world had become \u2013 big, non-descript, faceless, and corporate. Combining over 60 years of brewing experience with some of the big guys, Rick and Barry sought to create deliciously hand crafted ales and lagers that would bear no resemblance to the world of big beer. Full-bodied and distinctly rich beer, using only the choicest malts, hops and yeast, would be the focus of the product, while the co-owners personalities would blend to create the marketing milieu \u2013 edgy, young, independent\u2026definitely East Van.","website":"http:\/\/www.r-and-b.com\/","established":"1997","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/2vIPMI\/upload_pip4sx-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/2vIPMI\/upload_pip4sx-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/2vIPMI\/upload_pip4sx-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/2vIPMI\/upload_pip4sx-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/2vIPMI\/upload_pip4sx-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:55:29","locations":[{"id":"g9JaLp","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"54 East 4th Ave.","locality":"Vancouver","region":"British Columbia","postalCode":"V5T 1E8","phone":"1-604-874-2537","website":"http:\/\/www.r-and-b.com\/","latitude":49.267381,"longitude":-123.103715,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"CA","yearOpened":"1997","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"CA","name":"CANADA","displayName":"Canada","isoThree":"CAN","numberCode":124,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"9kT6K8","name":"Boon Island Lager","nameDisplay":"Boon Island Lager","styleId":80,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-04-19 01:38:31","updateDate":"2012-04-19 01:38:31","style":{"id":80,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Vienna-Style Lager","shortName":"Vienna Lager","description":"Beers in this category are reddish brown or copper colored.

The air seems crisper and the snow covers the landscaping like a natural gift wrapping. There\u2019s just no other place like it. And that\u2019s the feeling that inspired Colorado Native Winterfest. It\u2019s our way of celebrating this special time of the year and toasting our friends in Colorado.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe began brewing Colorado Native Winterfest back in September. We begin with our prized two-row barley, custom roasted to give the beer its rich, creamy flavor. Choice Colorado-grown hops are added to create the aroma and festive taste. After brewing, we chill-lager the beer to develop its distinctive taste and crisp, clean finish.  Happy Holidays from all of us at the AC Golden Brewing Company.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of seasonal beers to choose from, but there\u2019s only one that is brewed with 100% Colorado ingredients: barley grown in the San Luis Valley, Colorado-grown hops, Rocky Mountain water and the oldest variety of brewing yeast in the state. The majority of the barley and hops used to brew other Colorado beers comes from out-of-state.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy using only Colorado-grown barley and hops we are supporting the Colorado agriculture community. Our bottles are made in Wheat Ridge, our cans are made in Golden and we do not sell our beer outside of the state: this adds up to a smaller carbon footprint and a great tasting all Colorado beer.
