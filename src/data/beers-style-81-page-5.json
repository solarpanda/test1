We brew this beer true to the original style so you can enjoy some Oktoberfest cheer from the other side of the planet.","abv":"5","ibu":"20","glasswareId":5,"srmId":15,"availableId":7,"styleId":81,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/oGtDY0\/upload_fbaVMt-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/oGtDY0\/upload_fbaVMt-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/oGtDY0\/upload_fbaVMt-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:49","updateDate":"2015-12-16 06:20:39","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"srm":{"id":15,"name":"15","hex":"BB5100"},"available":{"id":7,"name":"Fall","description":"Available during the fall months."},"style":{"id":81,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"German-Style M\u00e4rzen","shortName":"M\u00e4rzen","description":"M\u00e4rzens are characterized by a medium body and broad range of color.

He took Dani and the three kids to meet the owner of the property, Al Walters. Mr. Walters took an immediate liking to the Jones family and allowed Dani and Larry to sell produce from his corner. Being a farmer, he even started growing corn and other vegetables for them. One day, Larry's father showed up with a bushel of live crabs and left them with Dani to sell. The crabs sold so fast that they picked up more crabs, shrimp, and other types of seafood too. In 1994, Mr. Walters passed away and Dani and Larry had to move on to bigger and better things. They rented a space in the Chalfont Village Shopping Center and opened a restaurant and fresh fish market. Dani and Larry did all the cooking. Larry would go to the fish market daily to ensure the freshest seafood. And with the help of loyal family and friends, Jones Family Seafood became a popular seafood restaurant in the area.\r\n    Early in 2001, Larry received a mailing, the kind we all ignore, advertising \"Brew your own beer\". He was immediately hooked. After convincing Dani that this was a good idea, they met up with a \"brew master\", ordered the equipment, and they were on their way.","website":"http:\/\/www.crabbylarrys.com\/","established":"1990","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/m6aqF7\/upload_NiSbcP-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/m6aqF7\/upload_NiSbcP-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/m6aqF7\/upload_NiSbcP-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/m6aqF7\/upload_NiSbcP-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/m6aqF7\/upload_NiSbcP-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:43:48","locations":[{"id":"WtMfgN","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"237 West Butler Avenue","locality":"Chalfont","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"18914","phone":"215-822-8788","website":"http:\/\/www.crabbylarrys.com\/","latitude":40.2795364,"longitude":-75.2143123,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1990","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2015-10-19 17:09:38","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"snBEi1","name":"Oktoberfest","nameDisplay":"Oktoberfest","description":"Golden, crisp, rich malt, balanced","abv":"5","ibu":"22","glasswareId":3,"styleId":81,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:49","updateDate":"2012-03-22 13:05:41","glass":{"id":3,"name":"Mug","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"style":{"id":81,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"German-Style M\u00e4rzen","shortName":"M\u00e4rzen","description":"M\u00e4rzens are characterized by a medium body and broad range of color.

The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery. Goose Island beers are now enjoyed in all 50 states and Europe.","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:46:51","locations":[{"id":"S2n5TB","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1800 West Fulton Street","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60612","phone":"1-800-466-7363","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","latitude":41.887107,"longitude":-87.6720969,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:33:51","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"D2gG2C","name":"Clybourn","streetAddress":"1800 North Clybourn Avenue","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60614","phone":"800-466-7363","latitude":41.9137242,"longitude":-87.65373,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1988","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:32:55","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"iMF8xJ","name":"Oktoberfest","nameDisplay":"Oktoberfest","availableId":4,"styleId":81,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:49","updateDate":"2015-04-10 16:49:05","available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":81,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"German-Style M\u00e4rzen","shortName":"M\u00e4rzen","description":"M\u00e4rzens are characterized by a medium body and broad range of color.
