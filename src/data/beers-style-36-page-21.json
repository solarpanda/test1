During the next eight years, they both graduated, Bailey went off to Vanderbilt Law School, and Robyn entered the working world, but both thought they were meant for much bigger and more alcoholic things.","website":"http:\/\/www.jackalopebrew.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/p1tFbP\/upload_FgvJzY-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/p1tFbP\/upload_FgvJzY-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/p1tFbP\/upload_FgvJzY-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/p1tFbP\/upload_FgvJzY-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/p1tFbP\/upload_FgvJzY-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:04:10","locations":[{"id":"Syl46S","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"701 8th Avenue South","locality":"Nashville","region":"Tennessee","postalCode":"37203","phone":"857-998-2571","website":"http:\/\/www.jackalopebrew.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Thursday: 4PM - 8PM\r\nFriday: 4PM - 8PM\r\nSaturday: 4PM - 8PM","latitude":36.1503749,"longitude":-86.779494,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"uYryBL","name":"Pearl of Kent","nameDisplay":"Pearl of Kent","description":"A gorgeous, easy-drinking Golden Ale where tropical fruit flavors come to the fore ahead of a subtle yet rewarding bitterness.","abv":"4.5","styleId":36,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-04-14 13:52:47","updateDate":"2015-04-14 13:52:48","style":{"id":36,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Golden or Blonde Ale","shortName":"Blonde","description":"Golden or Blonde ales are straw to golden blonde in color.

While these kits satisfy most home-brewers (the normal ones), The Firth Brothers quickly decided they just weren\u2019t making enough beer. They had mouths to feed \u2014 their family\u2019s, friend\u2019s, friends of friend\u2019s, friends of friends of friend\u2019s, the occasional enemy\u2019s, and their own \u2014 and so they had to go bigger. The Brothers saw no other option. Thousands of dollars later, their garage became a brewing frontier. They spent years crafting different styles of beers and used their guests as test dummies (no one minded). The Firth garage was a true underground experience \u2014 kegs stacked on kegs lined the walls, racks of replacement parts crowded the entryway, the smell of oil and somehow sawdust latched to everyone\u2019s clothing, and a single torn couch was the only available seating. The guests never minded, though: the beer was always great. And the Brothers never seemed to mind when the get-togethers dragged into the early morning. Attracting lively, somewhat unruly people is what they had set out to do, but the walls of the garage seemed to be getting smaller each day.\r\n\r\nEventually, the Brothers asked the question: why don\u2019t we open up a brewery? The reality of the idea, however, was riddled with frustrating technicalities, mostly concerning money and legal regulations. Their discussions of opening a brewery often trialed off into how to overthrow the government or rob banks. Once the dust of annoying logistics had finally settled (legally), the Brothers started shopping for buildings. They eventually agreed to pack their wagons and settle their equipment in 2545 Progress St.\r\n\r\nWhat was once a huge empty room has become a rustic, good-ole\u2019-days oasis that happens to make beer. Miss-matching, reclaimed wood lines the walk-in cooler and patio fence. Vintage hanging bulbs replaced the harsh florescent lighting. The bar is hand-crafted from wood, concrete, and iron. Even the bathrooms have style: they\u2019re converted into what look like out-houses (don\u2019t worry: the pluming still works). Booze Brothers Brewing Co. asks people to forget they are in the industrial area of Vista, and even more, that we are in living in the 2000s. Most important is that Booze Brothers Brewing Co. maintains the spirit of the original concept of the Firth garage \u2014 an underground (albeit legitimate) place for all types of people who should have at least one thing in common: a love for good beer.","website":"http:\/\/boozebrothersbrewery.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/xaBLno\/upload_Ca9D8k-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/xaBLno\/upload_Ca9D8k-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/xaBLno\/upload_Ca9D8k-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/xaBLno\/upload_Ca9D8k-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/xaBLno\/upload_Ca9D8k-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-04-08 13:11:43","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:53:28","locations":[{"id":"Zhydrx","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2545 Progress Street","extendedAddress":"Suite D","locality":"Vista","region":"California","postalCode":"92081","phone":"(760) 295-0217","website":"http:\/\/boozebrothersbrewery.com\/","latitude":33.148172,"longitude":-117.218047,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-04-08 13:13:42","updateDate":"2015-08-26 16:23:19","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"5ecjG4","name":"Pepperbelly Blonde","nameDisplay":"Pepperbelly Blonde","description":"Our clean, crisp blonde, spiced with pepper for extra flavor.","abv":"6.5","ibu":"18","styleId":36,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-24 19:00:04","updateDate":"2014-09-24 19:00:04","style":{"id":36,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Golden or Blonde Ale","shortName":"Blonde","description":"Golden or Blonde ales are straw to golden blonde in color.

That's because we are Brewers; proud brewers of fine hand crafted Ales from our historic brewery building in the Kensington neighborhood of Philadelphia. Now that's out of the way; we will be starting out with four mainstay brews which will be available in draught and in bottles. Once we're stocked up on the core brews we'll start pumping out regular seasonal or specialty brews. The specialty series will be driven by our individual brewers and the desires and whims of the rest of our family.  The beer is flowing at Philadelphia Brewing co!

Driven by a desire for a quality, local product that would complement and diversify the already existing pub's style and reputation, Larry and Peter knew they would have to focus on producing a high quality product if it was going to be a success.  Knowing his beer knowledge and passion for the family business in which he grew up, Larry and Peter soon brought Larry's son Andrew into the conversation.  Beginning in a consulting roll, Andrew soon decided it was time to come back into the fold and asked his father and uncle for an opportunity to rejoin the family business in a full-time position.  In the coming year as business at the pub rolled on and continued to grow, so too did the brewery project.  Moving from an idea spoken about \u201coff the clock\u201d to a plan developed in a weekly owner's meeting, Geaghan Brothers Brewing Company began to take shape.  The project received a major boost in the most unlikely of circumstances when Larry, attending a local funeral, made contact with Sarah Courtney, a woman who grew up with Larry's oldest son Thomas.  Sarah and her husband Jason had spent the past 15 years working full-time in brewpub and microbrewery settings.  Jason had progressed from homebrewer to assistant brewer to head brewer and in 2002 had a very successful showing at the Great American Beer Festival, receiving the brewpub category brewmaster of the year honors.  As Larry, Peter and Andrew continued conversations and expressed their desire to build a small-scale brewery in Bangor, Jason and Sarah also expressed their interest in moving back to the Bangor area.  In time, with many conversations and meetings, both desires began to take shape.  With many options available to them, Jason and Sarah decided an opportunity to have a foundational and long-term impact on and relationship with a truly local brewery in Bangor, Maine was exactly what they were looking for.  In December 2011 the idea became a reality.  The Geaghan Family, together with award winning brewer Jason Courtney, have begun pouring pints of locally craft brewed beer from Geaghan Brothers Brewing Company exclusively at Geaghan's Pub.","website":"http:\/\/www.geaghanspub.com","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jmyqSv\/upload_Fwpywr-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jmyqSv\/upload_Fwpywr-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jmyqSv\/upload_Fwpywr-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jmyqSv\/upload_Fwpywr-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jmyqSv\/upload_Fwpywr-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-10 18:56:21","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:42:57","locations":[{"id":"oN5ry0","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"570 Main Street","locality":"Bangor","region":"Maine","postalCode":"04401","phone":"207-945-3730","website":"http:\/\/www.geaghanspub.com","latitude":44.786998,"longitude":-68.777343,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-10 19:02:53","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"xJCQxl","name":"Pro Pig Mosaic Blonde Ale","nameDisplay":"Pro Pig Mosaic Blonde Ale","styleId":36,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-19 19:39:44","updateDate":"2015-02-19 19:39:44","style":{"id":36,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Golden or Blonde Ale","shortName":"Blonde","description":"Golden or Blonde ales are straw to golden blonde in color.

With a focus on the revival of artisan brewing, we strive to create the highest quality products available.\r\n\r\nBrewing techniques as timeless as beer itself are used to create a uniquely handmade product. We craft the finest possible beer in small batches normally not found in the industry today which is typically dominated by mega mergers of international breweries. Is this difficult and more time consuming? Yes. Does it require more manual labor? Yes. Is it worth it? Unequivocally, YES. As beer is a \u201cliving, breathing\u201d product made from precise strains of active yeast cultures, it just makes good sense to nurture the product in very manageable small batches. We believe that the extra care and attention devoted to each batch produces the best possible result and you as our friends deserve no less.\r\n\r\nWe hope that you will have the opportunity to experience the limited quantities of hand crafted beer that we produce in Charlotte. When you do, please notice the complexities of the aroma, the silkiness of its body, and the explosion of flavors as the grains merge artfully with the yeast cultures and noble hops blended meticulously for each variety. Join us in celebrating the pleasures of hand crafted beers and life in the Queen City finally merged into this moment in time and allow yourself the pleasure of enjoying a uniquely Charlotte experience.","website":"http:\/\/fourfriendsbrewing.com\/","established":"2007","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/hcCgPK\/upload_470DWs-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/hcCgPK\/upload_470DWs-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/hcCgPK\/upload_470DWs-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/hcCgPK\/upload_470DWs-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/hcCgPK\/upload_470DWs-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:05:51","locations":[{"id":"amIfT7","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"10913 C Office Park Drive","locality":"Charlotte","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"28273","website":"http:\/\/fourfriendsbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Saturday: 3pm - 7pm","latitude":35.12048,"longitude":-80.9595499,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2007","yearClosed":"2014","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"6oeKpu","name":"Queue de Charrue Blond","nameDisplay":"Queue de Charrue Blond","description":"The Blond beer \u00ab Queue de Charrue \u00bb is a high fermented beer with a sweet and generous taste.
