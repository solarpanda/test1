It\u2019s not just because of the award-winning fine ales and great food served up by the Rubicon. Within the past four years, under the auspices of owner Glynn Phillips, the Rubicon has become renowned for its community outreach and philanthropic efforts. It\u2019s support for Sacramento kids and various people in need that has transformed the Rubicon into a vital cog of Sacramento life.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis pub is part of the community, and I don\u2019t just mean geographically,\u201d said Glynn Phillips, owner of the Rubicon since June 2005. \u201cIt\u2019s important for us to give back as much as we can to show our appreciation. I really feel like we\u2019re connected with the people and that they can trust that they\u2019ll feel at home here.\u201d\r\n\r\nBrewmaster Scott Cramlet has felt so at home that he\u2019s stayed more than two decades. In October 2006, he experienced a thrill very few craft brewers achieve in their careers: stepping on stage to receive a gold medal at the Great American Beer Festival. Cramlet won for his Winter Wheatwine, and followed that achievement with a silver GABF medal in 2009. In the craft brewing industry, consistent victories in the respected blind-panel tasting contest bring international acclaim.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gone through so many different phases during my time here, but we\u2019re very happy with things right now,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a lot of hope for future and expanding our business. We hope to double our capacity and get more of our products in bottles and more of a market presence -- not too huge but bigger than we are now. I\u2019m certainly very proud to work for a place that has been around so long and has its place in history. We are not the new kid on street. I tell people how long I\u2019ve been at the Rubicon, and I hear people say, \u2018Wow, that\u2019s impressive.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\nIn some ways, the transition from founder Ed Brown to Phillips was more than a decade in the making. Brown had known Phillips since the 1970s as the good friend of Brown\u2019s nephews in the Bay Area town of Moraga. As Phillips paid his dues in the craft brewing industry \u2013 first at Great Basin Brewing in Sparks, Nev., and next at Marin Brewing in Larkspur \u2013 Phillips kept in close contact with Brown. Buoyed by his management experience at Marin Brewing, Phillips was confident that he could handle the passing of the baton at the Rubicon.","website":"http:\/\/www.rubiconbrewing.com\/","established":"1987","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/iBzEfC\/upload_PQRPEH-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/iBzEfC\/upload_PQRPEH-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/iBzEfC\/upload_PQRPEH-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/iBzEfC\/upload_PQRPEH-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/iBzEfC\/upload_PQRPEH-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:56:28","locations":[{"id":"N39Q0L","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2004 Capitol Avenue","locality":"Sacramento","region":"California","postalCode":"95814","phone":"916-448-7032","website":"http:\/\/www.rubiconbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday - Thrusday: 11am to 11:30pm\r\nFriday & Saturday: 11am to 12:30am\r\nSunday: 11am to 10pm","latitude":38.573116,"longitude":-121.480958,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1987","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"sTKt2K","name":"Irish Red Ale","nameDisplay":"Irish Red Ale","description":"Our Irish Red keeps true to the malty finish of a traditional Irish Red.

He chose the site of an ancient monastery, St Francis Abbey in Kilkenny City, to position his brewery. John was inspired by a tradition of brewing on this site, the foundations of which were laid four centuries earlier. Back in the 13th century the Franciscans established an Abbey, with its own well, on the banks of the River Nore in Kilkenny. Whilst brewing and barley cultivation are recorded in Irish Annals from the mists of time, the strong brewing tradition that exists in Kilkenny started with these monks who would have brewed their own light ale for their visitors, using water from St Francis' Well. To this day the Abbey stands proudly at the heart of the brewery and continues to inspire our brewers.","website":"http:\/\/www.smithwicks.ie\/","established":"1710","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/basAdv\/upload_9v8JEI-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/basAdv\/upload_9v8JEI-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/basAdv\/upload_9v8JEI-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/basAdv\/upload_9v8JEI-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/basAdv\/upload_9v8JEI-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:58:57","locations":[{"id":"FRXKiy","name":"Main Brewery","locality":"Kilkenny Co.","region":"Kilkenny","phone":"+353 (0)56 779 64 98","latitude":52.651194,"longitude":-7.251514,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"IE","yearOpened":"1710","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"IE","name":"IRELAND","displayName":"Ireland","isoThree":"IRL","numberCode":372,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"wfdRk3","name":"Irish Red Ale","nameDisplay":"Irish Red Ale","description":"This traditional medium-bodied, malty brew is super smooth with a toasty sweet aroma created by the addition of biscuit and melanoidin malts.","abv":"5.8","ibu":"23","availableId":4,"styleId":22,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-05-20 16:41:11","updateDate":"2012-05-21 13:17:47","available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":22,"categoryId":2,"category":{"id":2,"name":"Irish Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Irish-Style Red Ale","shortName":"Irish Red","description":"Irish-style red ales range from light red-amber-copper to light brown in color.

He took Dani and the three kids to meet the owner of the property, Al Walters. Mr. Walters took an immediate liking to the Jones family and allowed Dani and Larry to sell produce from his corner. Being a farmer, he even started growing corn and other vegetables for them. One day, Larry's father showed up with a bushel of live crabs and left them with Dani to sell. The crabs sold so fast that they picked up more crabs, shrimp, and other types of seafood too. In 1994, Mr. Walters passed away and Dani and Larry had to move on to bigger and better things. They rented a space in the Chalfont Village Shopping Center and opened a restaurant and fresh fish market. Dani and Larry did all the cooking. Larry would go to the fish market daily to ensure the freshest seafood. And with the help of loyal family and friends, Jones Family Seafood became a popular seafood restaurant in the area.\r\n    Early in 2001, Larry received a mailing, the kind we all ignore, advertising \"Brew your own beer\". He was immediately hooked. After convincing Dani that this was a good idea, they met up with a \"brew master\", ordered the equipment, and they were on their way.","website":"http:\/\/www.crabbylarrys.com\/","established":"1990","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/m6aqF7\/upload_NiSbcP-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/m6aqF7\/upload_NiSbcP-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/m6aqF7\/upload_NiSbcP-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/m6aqF7\/upload_NiSbcP-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/m6aqF7\/upload_NiSbcP-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:43:48","locations":[{"id":"WtMfgN","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"237 West Butler Avenue","locality":"Chalfont","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"18914","phone":"215-822-8788","website":"http:\/\/www.crabbylarrys.com\/","latitude":40.2795364,"longitude":-75.2143123,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1990","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2015-10-19 17:09:38","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"bL3n9j","name":"Irish Red Ale","nameDisplay":"Irish Red Ale","styleId":22,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-09-23 21:02:51","updateDate":"2015-09-23 21:02:51","style":{"id":22,"categoryId":2,"category":{"id":2,"name":"Irish Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Irish-Style Red Ale","shortName":"Irish Red","description":"Irish-style red ales range from light red-amber-copper to light brown in color.

When he wasn\u2019t busy handcrafting smoked summer sausage and pepperoni at the deli he was handcrafting small batches of beer.  Dick built from scratch a three barrel brew house (which we still use today as our pilot system) to start designing and creating recipes in the back of the deli. The beer was so popular among Dick\u2019s friends that he soon found himself exceeding the annual production limit for homebrewers.  In 1992 Dick decided to make his hobby a business and started the application and permit process to create Dick\u2019s Brewing Company.  After two years and many batches brewed, and many beers drank, Dick\u2019s Brewing Company became a reality.\r\n\r\nDick quickly realized he would need more space for his growing passion and built a 2,100 square foot building adjacent to the deli.  He started with the three barrel system and would brew once a week yielding 6 kegs.  Initially he focused solely on three beers: Pale, Porter and Dick Danger.  Dick Danger Ale, is still our best selling beer to date.  When asked why he started the brewery Dick always answered, and I quote, \u201cI started brewing beer for one reason, I was thirsty\u201d.   And we are all so grateful he was.\r\n\r\nThe brewery was located behind the Deli on Prather Road from 1995 to 2008.  Over those 13 years the brewery grew from 200 bbls in sales in one state to over 3000 bbls in 6 states.   New uni tanks and bright tanks were added along with a brand new bottling line to keep up with demand, and Dicks creative passion for brewing also grew, starting with three recipes in 1994 to over twenty different styles in 2009.  Life was good and  Dick\u2019s Beers were flying out the door.\r\nIn 2006 Dick set his sights even higher, and he started construction on a new brewing facility. After two long years of work  we moved into the brand new 18000 square foot brewing facility on Galvin Road in Centralia.\r\n\r\nDick wore many hats and he was so many things to so many people.  In 2009 we lost a brewmaster, a friend, a dad, a partner, a son, a teacher, a rebel, an electrician, a plumber, a carpenter, a craftsman, a joker, a complete and unique leader.  He will always be remembered and by doing so his vision and his dream will forever live on in every bottle or keg that gets shipped from the warehouse to someone that is thirsty.\r\n\r\nToday, the Dick\u2019s Brew Crew is led by Dick\u2019s daughter, Julie Young.  With the new brewing facility producing 23 different styles and with plenty of room for growth, we feel that the sky is the limit when it comes to Dick\u2019s legacy.  All of us here at Dick\u2019s are proud to continue the dream that our founder started, and we are proud to have you all along for the ride.","website":"http:\/\/dicksbeer.com\/","established":"1984","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/GC3a1f\/upload_tiILgV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/GC3a1f\/upload_tiILgV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/GC3a1f\/upload_tiILgV-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/GC3a1f\/upload_tiILgV-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/GC3a1f\/upload_tiILgV-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:44:31","locations":[{"id":"TkT8Rc","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"5945 Prather Road","locality":"Centralia","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98531","phone":"800-586-7760","website":"http:\/\/dicksbeer.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Fridays 3pm - 7pm","latitude":46.771347,"longitude":-123.007543,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1984","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"3o88Fe","name":"Irish Style Red","nameDisplay":"Irish Style Red","styleId":22,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/3o88Fe\/upload_AgQMKf-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/3o88Fe\/upload_AgQMKf-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/3o88Fe\/upload_AgQMKf-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-11-19 15:47:43","updateDate":"2015-12-17 07:19:18","style":{"id":22,"categoryId":2,"category":{"id":2,"name":"Irish Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Irish-Style Red Ale","shortName":"Irish Red","description":"Irish-style red ales range from light red-amber-copper to light brown in color.
