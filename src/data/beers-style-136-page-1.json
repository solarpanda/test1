This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb\/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer.

Art co-founded one of the state's first microbreweries, Portland Brewing, as well as the Oregon Brewers Festival, which today is one of the world's preeminent craft beer festivals. \r\n\r\nCascade Brewmaster Ron Gansberg got his start in the Northwest wine industry. He crossed over in 1986 and began an eight-year career at BridgePort Brewing Co., where he honed his brewing skills, then moved on to the equipment and engineering side of the industry. As Engineering Manager at BridgePort, Ron directed the design and installation of the 80 bbl brewhouse that is still in operation. \r\n\r\nTogether, Art and Ron put their 40 years of beer experience to work, designing and installing Cascade's state-of-the-art 10 bbl brewing system in SW Portland, then creating and distributing well-balanced market-priced ales ranging from Pale Ale to Copper to Blond Bock. As the quality of the beer improved, they began to sell through distributors, increasing production to satisfy the wholesale market. \r\n\r\nCascade Brewery is situated in the Pacific Northwest, a region renowned for its craft beers - the Portland metropolitan area has 42 breweries, more than any other metro area in the US, and is the nation's largest craft brewing market. Even though there are an abundance of breweries in this area, it's highly competitive.

At times drawing influences from the world beyond traditional brewers\u2019 yeast, Jester King\u2019s beer is not rushed to market but allowed to mature \u2013 often in oak barrels \u2013 to create the most enjoyable, interesting and exciting beer we can make. An additional layer of complexity is added to Jester King\u2019s bottled beers by allowing a second fermentation to take place in the bottle. As part of its commitment to sustainability, the slow food movement and Texas, Jester King beer uses as many organic and local ingredients as possible and will soon be brewed with harvested rainwater.","website":"http:\/\/www.jesterkingbrewery.com\/","established":"2010","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/jesterkingbrewery.us2.list-manage.com\/subscribe?u=6f34dbbfef5b3f1e8acd76313&id=0c0f75758f","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/7kCNmJ\/upload_WRgBwI-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/7kCNmJ\/upload_WRgBwI-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/7kCNmJ\/upload_WRgBwI-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/7kCNmJ\/upload_WRgBwI-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/7kCNmJ\/upload_WRgBwI-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:59","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:07:54","locations":[{"id":"M4K0XQ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"13005 Fitzhugh Rd","extendedAddress":"Bld.

The intense hop aromas from 3 separate dry hoppings achieve great complexity as they interact with the wild yeast. The beer is slightly drier than it was prior to barrel aging due in part to additional fermentation in the barrel as well as a slight tartness from the wild yeast.
