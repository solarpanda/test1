The Northville Winery originated across the parking lot in Parmenters Northville Cider Mill in 1982. Rob and Carina Nelson started making their own wine over 5 years ago and they have been expanding ever since, including adding a microbrewery this year. All of our grapes and apples are brought in from the West side of Michigan. We then do all the pressing in the cider mill and fermenting and bottling in the winery building. Every bottle is filled and labeled by hand. The winery produces several alcoholic wines, hard cider flavors and most recently BEER!

Rogue's first brewpub was located in Ashland, Oregon and was a 10bbl brewsystem. Rogue opened a second brewpub, 15bbl brewsystem, in May 1989 located in Newport, Oregon. Rogue closed its Ashland operation in 1997, after the great flood destroyed the place. In 1991, the 15bbl system, named Howard after John Maier's former boss, from the Newport brewpub was transferred across the bay to the current brewery and upgraded to a 30bbl system. In 1998 Rogue bought a 50bbl brewsystem, named Kobe. Kobe is the only brewsystem in use. Tours: We offer brewery tours every day at 3 pm (followed by a distillery tour at 4pm). Go up to the bar inside the brewery (Brewers on the Bay) and check in with the bartender and the tour will commence. Please call ahead if you have a large group and or to verify the tour time...Brewer's on the Bay phone is 541-867-3664.
