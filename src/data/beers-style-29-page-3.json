As if that weren't enough, we dry-hopped Through Hiker in the fermenter with even more Cascade hops!\r\n\r\nWhat does all this mean? 56 IBU's is what it means. At 13.5 Lovibond, Through Hiker is Amber in color with a slightly reddish hue due to the addition of Crystal malt and the ample addition of Cara-Pils malt.

Our total grain bill weighed out at just over 450 lbs. which adds up to 7.9% abv. so please drink responsibly, lamp shades on the head are SO yesterday...We'll be rolling out the red carpet for Through Hiker on Monday August 18th and it will only be available on site at the Woodstock Inn, Station and Brewery!","abv":"7.9","ibu":"56","glasswareId":5,"availableId":1,"styleId":29,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-04-23 13:44:36","updateDate":"2015-04-22 15:15:39","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":29,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Strong Pale Ale","shortName":"American Strong Pale","description":"American strong pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.

We have taken a different tack than many new brewers, and rather than going for a number of very big, single batch beers, we are focused on food-friendly beers in a smaller lineup that is readily available year round. We realized a long time ago that food-friendly by no means needs to be less flavorful, and we actually add ingredients to widen the palate of our beers above and beyond their original styles.\r\n\r\nTo better integrate with a meal and make our beers more \u2018sessionable\u2019 in general, we utilize highly attenuating yeasts to dry out our beers to make them less sweet and filling, then replace that desired sweetness with an addition outside the norm, such as Juniper, Ginger or even Angelica. These ingredients are always kept at a level to avoid building a \u2018spice beer\u2019, and always present themselves as a unique and complementary addition. We also focus on extremely clean finishes, and use the entire recipe to build bittering rather than just using the hops to reduce lingering starchiness.\r\n\r\nIn the end, the true beauty of any flavor is in the eye (and mouth) of the beholder. Read about our beers here, then taste them at your local restaurant or store and judge for yourself if we have truly crafted \u2018Great Beer Designed With Great Food In Mind\u2019.
