Over time, as Bob became more interested in cider, we started traveling to the Pays D\u2019Auge region of Normandy, where we tasted many varieties of this traditional beverage that is typically served with meals, and is the perfect complement to the wonderful cuisine of the area.\r\nAs we experienced the cider culture of northern France, we realized that nothing like these dry, complex ciders existed in the U.S., and we became excited about the prospect of introducing a French-style cider to the American palate. Back at our orchard, we began planting cider cultivars from France, England and America, while testing the types that would work best with the Island\u2019s climate and rocky limestone soil. Our Washington Island orchard has expanded with our passion for cider, and we now produce several varieties of gluten-free cider in our Cider House in the small town of Ellison Bay, WI, located at the tip of the Door Peninsula.","website":"http:\/\/islandorchardcider.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/yy3cTm\/upload_1kRAgF-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/yy3cTm\/upload_1kRAgF-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/yy3cTm\/upload_1kRAgF-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/yy3cTm\/upload_1kRAgF-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/yy3cTm\/upload_1kRAgF-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-08-01 14:09:54","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:14:21","locations":[{"id":"l9BVLi","name":"Main Cidery","streetAddress":"12040 Garrett Bay Rd","locality":"Ellison Bay","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"54210","phone":"(920) 854-3344","website":"http:\/\/islandorchardcider.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"SPRING (5\/1\u20135\/24)\r\nFri: 2-5 pm\r\nSat: 12-5 pm\r\nSun: 12-3 pm\r\nOpen Memorial Day 5\/25:\r\n12-3 pm\r\n\r\nSUMMER (5\/29\u20139\/14)\r\nDaily: 12-6 pm\r\n\r\nFALL (9\/17\u201310\/26)\r\nThurs: 12-4 pm\r\nFri\/Sat. : 12-6 pm\r\nSun\/Mon: 12-3 pm\r\n\r\nWINTER (10\/30\u201311\/28)\r\nFri: 2-6 pm\r\nSat: 12-5 pm\r\nSun: Closed","latitude":45.2563309,"longitude":-87.0712481,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"cidery","locationTypeDisplay":"Cidery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-08-01 14:13:52","updateDate":"2015-08-01 14:13:52","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"rl0bek","name":"Nomad","nameDisplay":"Nomad","description":"Wander no longer, there is finally is your true Northern Michigan Hard Cider, Nomad.

Named in honour of Princess Mary, a daughter of King George III, it became home to a small group of disbanded German mercenaries under former Lieutenant Baron von Reitzenstein. This party, numbering about 40 persons, was one of the earliest German-speaking groups to settle in Ontario. By October 1784 they had begun to clear and cultivate the land. Henry David and his wife Elizabeth were among these early settlers and it was in 1830, that their son Conrad David, was given title to the lot, which the County Cider Co. now calls home.\r\n\r\nconradhouseToday, the 1832 Conrad David House is an area landmark. Set on the brow of the Waupoos escarpment, the stone house is an excellent example of Regency Cottage architecture.

Next door, the property\u2019s picturesque 1832 stone barn houses the County Cider Co.\u2019s tasting room and retail store.
