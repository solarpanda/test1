Reduce your carbon footprint, eat local, buy local, produce something local, be self sufficient as much as you can, smile, and please try to leave the world a little better than you found it, because, after all, we are just renting it.","website":"http:\/\/www.thornstreetbrew.com","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/W8Mdcy\/upload_TNdS6q-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/W8Mdcy\/upload_TNdS6q-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/W8Mdcy\/upload_TNdS6q-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/W8Mdcy\/upload_TNdS6q-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/W8Mdcy\/upload_TNdS6q-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-16 21:58:21","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:52:34","locations":[{"id":"MtbXzz","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"3176 Thorn St","locality":"San Diego","region":"California","postalCode":"92104","website":"http:\/\/www.thornstreetbrew.com","hoursOfOperation":"Tue - Thu: 4:00 pm - 10:00 pm\r\nFri: 2:00 pm - 11:00 pm\r\nSat: 12:00 pm - 11:00 am\r\nSun: 12:00 pm - 9:00 pm","latitude":32.7393459,"longitude":-117.1255023,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-16 21:59:51","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"mkb2qJ","name":"Castillo Coconut Porter","nameDisplay":"Castillo Coconut Porter","description":"This one of  a kind porter is a pleasant mix of dark chocolate and black malts.

With the closing of the Stark Mill Brewery and the many changes that have befell the city in the recent years, Peter felt that Manchester, as New Hampshire's Queen City, was sadly falling the way of commercial and contract beers. He, with a dedicated following of fans of his brew, set to work reopening the brewery as \"Milly's Tavern,\" proudly operating as Manchester's only brew pub. We welcome you as our guests to stop by and try a glass of Peter's hard work.","website":"http:\/\/millystavern.com\/","established":"2002","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/DTsVn8\/upload_IvUQ57-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/DTsVn8\/upload_IvUQ57-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/DTsVn8\/upload_IvUQ57-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/DTsVn8\/upload_IvUQ57-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/DTsVn8\/upload_IvUQ57-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:02","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:52:24","locations":[{"id":"8gAMPa","name":"Main Brewpub","streetAddress":"500 Commercial Street","locality":"Manchester","region":"New Hampshire","postalCode":"03101","phone":"603-625-4444","website":"http:\/\/millystavern.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Thu: 11:00 am - 11:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:00 am - 1:00 am\r\nSun: 11:00 am - 6:00 pm","latitude":42.9940958,"longitude":-71.467279,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2002","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:02","updateDate":"2014-09-26 13:37:15","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"EeMcR4","name":"Cherry Sour Porter","nameDisplay":"Cherry Sour Porter","abv":"6","styleId":18,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/EeMcR4\/upload_X2DtOs-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/EeMcR4\/upload_X2DtOs-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/EeMcR4\/upload_X2DtOs-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-01-29 13:20:14","updateDate":"2015-12-17 08:52:19","style":{"id":18,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Brown Porter","shortName":"Brown Porter","description":"Brown porters are mid to dark brown (may have red tint) in color.

With the closing of the Stark Mill Brewery and the many changes that have befell the city in the recent years, Peter felt that Manchester, as New Hampshire's Queen City, was sadly falling the way of commercial and contract beers.

But what began as a light hobby soon developed into a deep passion. They quickly outgrew the offerings of U-Brew and expanded their operation into a homebrew setup. Fifteen years later, the two Mikes have a lot of batches, awards, and experience under their belts. Starting in May of 2008, Vertigo Brewing was christened a fully-licensed brewery in a Hillsboro warehouse. \r\nVertigo Brewing is currently operating a one barrel system, producing eight to ten barrels a month. But as demand takes off, the two Mikes are eagerly looking forward to an expanded business operation. Vertigo prides itself on producing a unique blend of beer offerings that manage to stand out in the beer-saturated market of the Northwest.","website":"http:\/\/www.vertigobrew.com\/","established":"2008","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/K3Jy1E\/upload_P1zfcl-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/K3Jy1E\/upload_P1zfcl-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/K3Jy1E\/upload_P1zfcl-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/K3Jy1E\/upload_P1zfcl-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/K3Jy1E\/upload_P1zfcl-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:10:02","locations":[{"id":"UVhQ24","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"21420 Northwest Nicholas Court","locality":"Hillsboro","region":"Oregon","postalCode":"97124","phone":"503-645-6644","website":"http:\/\/www.vertigobrew.com\/","latitude":45.5316652,"longitude":-122.895556,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2008","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"47PYQB","name":"Chocolatte Chocolate Porter","nameDisplay":"Chocolatte Chocolate Porter","abv":"6.8","styleId":18,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-03-13 02:16:50","updateDate":"2016-04-30 22:16:57","style":{"id":18,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Brown Porter","shortName":"Brown Porter","description":"Brown porters are mid to dark brown (may have red tint) in color.

Our mantra is big, bold flavors, made exactingly with natural ingredients. So, for example, if we say a beer will taste like peanut butter and jelly, you can be sure you\u2019ll smell and taste the fresh roasted peanuts and fruity berry jam. Our flagship beers such as Hop Gun IPA and Floridian Hefeweizen, also strive towards big, bold flavor. It\u2019s who we are.\r\n\r\nOur Brewery is located in the heart of Oakland Park\u2019s new Culinary Arts District. The 20,000 sq-ft facility is powered by a 30-barrel, three-piece brewhouse, which feeds nearly 1000 gallons of beer per batch into our four 60-barrel fermenters - a capacity that makes us South Florida\u2019s largest craft microbrewery. Each of our distinctive beers is brewed using the finest, all-natural ingredients, then served up unpasteurized, unfiltered, and unfussed with. We offer tours of our 20,000 sq-ft facility, rotating food trucks nightly, and growlers of our brewery fresh beer to-go.\r\n\r\nYou can sample our creations in our spacious tap room - open 7 days a week, noon to midnight - as well as in bars and restaurants all across South Florida. And of course, we still brew at our original location in Boca Raton, the Funky Buddha Brewery & Lounge, which has become a test kitchen for our more experimental brews.\r\n\r\nSee you soon for a pint!
