Always handcrafted, the bottle you hold is brewed for the adventurous soul. This is a very limited edition and we make no promises to ever brew this style again. \r\n\r\nA provocative 85 IBUs reverberates cleanly through this Double IPA. True hop saturation from kettle boil to dry hop cellaring dominates this elegant and lustful sensory enchantment. You hold a deceptively seductive Original Gravity of 20.9 degrees Plato, following the always 100% natural bottle fermentation.

This has been true since the day we quietly opened our first \u00bd barrel brewery and tap room on the west side of Decorah, IA in 2009. The batches were small but the taste was gigantic, and word spread like wildfire.\r\n\r\nToday, our team brews at a larger production facility on the edge of town, regularly experimenting at the tap room to satisfy our craving for new and exciting creations. Numbers are not our game, making a lot of the same beer is just too boring, and life is just too short.\r\n\r\nThe history of Toppling Goliath lies in the dreams of tomorrow, not the pages of the past. The past is for those who rely on high volume and low value. The past is for those who duplicate rather than design. The past is for cowards.

George gladly signed away and got down to some serious drinking.

Now, we all know dogs don\u2019t fly, but nobody told this particular dog it couldn\u2019t fly, just like no one had told George and his friends they couldn\u2019t make this extraordinary journey.

What started out as a place to share new creations with friends grew into a bi-monthly, totally free event with hundreds of our \u201cnew\u201d friends and great local street food vendors.\r\n \r\nPatrick and Bryan brew small batches which allows for constant beer experimentation.  They have been known to create exotic beer styles such as their Hibiscus Saison, Squid Ink Black IPA, Chamomile Ale, Lemongrass IPA, and Szechwan Peppercorn Red ale, wine soaked oak aged Brown Ale.  Pac Brew Lab is always on the lookout for new ingredients and inspirations that will help them create new and tantalizing yet pleasing and palatable beers for the public.","website":"http:\/\/www.pacbrewlab.com\/","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BBw7o7\/upload_a1zA0M-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BBw7o7\/upload_a1zA0M-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BBw7o7\/upload_a1zA0M-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BBw7o7\/upload_a1zA0M-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BBw7o7\/upload_a1zA0M-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-09-27 12:50:28","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:37:24","locations":[{"id":"hj7N75","name":"Main Brewery","locality":"San Francisco","region":"California","phone":"(415) 937-7843","latitude":37.777125,"longitude":-122.419644,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2010","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-09-27 13:28:09","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"GRmolP","name":"Imperial IPA Release # 2","nameDisplay":"Imperial IPA Release # 2","description":"This tawny-orange ale immediately assults the senses with the character of hops from the Pacific Northwest.
