This beer will be dark brown to mahogany in color, with smoky\/campfire notes and an aroma of caramel and brown sugar.\r\n\r\nThe malts used in this beer were Weyeremann Rauch (smoke) malt, Heildelberg pilsner, Weyeremann munich II, crystal 40, and pale chocolate. The beer was then hopped with Bravo, Czech Saaz and Tahoma. It's likely to finish at just over 8% ABV, and the maturation in barrels will continue to develop and polish the flavor of this beer. The body is expected to thin slightly, and the smoke aroma\/flavor will develop into an umami meatiness, like the rounded flavor of top notch charcuterie. The barrels should contribute little-to-no flavor but will aid in the overall character of this beer. Expect this to be malt\/yeast driven, having enough hop bitterness to balance any remaining malt sweetness.

The beautiful hand-carved, hand-split Philippine mahogany bar was created to serve the whiskey distilled on the second floor. The saloon enjoyed a brisk business from the turn of the century until the advent of prohibition in 1920. The building, rich in history, is on the national registry of historic landmarks and has been restored to much of its original grandeur. Among the original architectural elements that remain today are the beautiful bar, intricate mosaic tile floor, much of the stained glass and of course the decorative ceiling. The luxurious back-bar won the coveted blue ribbon for craftsmanship at the 1893 World Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Many myths and legends surround this historic building, including the presence of ghosts and spirits.
