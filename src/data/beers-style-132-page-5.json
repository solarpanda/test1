Within seven months of opening El Toro Brewing Company received its first national recognition at the 1994 Great American Beer Festival (GABF). One of its flagships El Toro Oro Golden Ale won a coveted Gold Medal for English Pale Ale. At the 1996 GABF Poppy Jasper Amber Ale, the brewery's other flagship beer, won a Silver Medal for English Brown Ale. It is a mild yet robust brown ale. The 1997 GABF saw El Toro garner another Gold Medal for the American styled wheat beer named after the brewer's father-in-law, William Jones Wheat Beer.  After 16 years of planning, Geno and Cindy Acevedo of Morgan Hill finally opened a brewpub on November 25 2006. El Toro Brewpub is a two floored building with patio. Inside is the world's only Poppy Jasper Bar. Featuring over 45 feet of gorgeously inlaid and polished Poppy Jasper rock into its surface. To the back of the large mirrored bar you will find over 25 beers and handcrafted sodas on tap. We also have a gleaming copper Pub Brewing system 3 BBL (100 gallon) brewery.

Legend has it that, in the spirit of brewing camaraderie, they would share product with one another - coffee in the morning, and beer after work. Eventually one tired soul needed a boost after a long day and dropped a shot of espresso in a glass of porter. And thus, Espresso Porter was born. As a result of super fresh, cold-brewed custom roast, the coffee element in the beer is all pleasantries and no harshness, which fits right in with the mild ABV. The boys tucked some of this away in a bourbon barrel in January, so expect an equally delicate set of complementary bourbon notes.","abv":"5.7","styleId":132,"isOrganic":"Y","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-07-12 19:33:27","updateDate":"2015-07-12 19:33:27","style":{"id":132,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Wood- and Barrel-Aged Beer","shortName":"BBL Aged","description":"A wood- or barrel-aged beer is any lager, ale or hybrid beer, either a traditional style or a unique experimental beer that has been aged for a period of time in a wooden barrel or in contact with wood.
