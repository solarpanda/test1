The perfect pub pint to share with your mates.  Public Ale's name is an ode to a sessionable style that not only has been commonly found in English public houses for centuries, but can be enjoyed today by everyone within our Community.  \r\n\u200b\r\nESB was originally brewed by the English brewery Fuller, Smith & Turner of London (Fuller\u2019s ESB) in the mid 20th century as a winter ale.  At Community Beer Company we appreciate this timeless, quaffable beer style and will bring it to you year round as our \u201cPublic Ale.\u201d  In reverence to the best ESB\u2019s of England, we brew it with nearly all English ingredients: 100% English malts, a blend of English, German and American hops, our house ale English yeast strain and of course our own crystal clear, filtered water.  The subtle complexities of this beer begin with a base of 100% Maris Otter English pale malt \u2013 prized for its superior, rich, bready taste \u2013 which adds a malt complexity that is difficult to achieve with modern, higher yielding malt varieties.  English crystal malt increases the malt complexity, brings amber color and some residual sweetness, all of which mingles well with the fully expressed fruity esters developed by our house ale yeast during fermentation.  While the hops are noticeable, they are part of an integrated whole, leaving the beer very well balanced and drinkable.","abv":"5.5","ibu":"38","glasswareId":5,"availableId":1,"styleId":5,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/AeVvwZ\/upload_mv9Joc-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/AeVvwZ\/upload_mv9Joc-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/AeVvwZ\/upload_mv9Joc-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","originalGravity":"1.057","createDate":"2013-05-29 16:42:31","updateDate":"2015-12-17 03:21:16","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":5,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Extra Special Bitter","shortName":"ESB","description":"Extra special bitter possesses medium to strong hop aroma, flavor, and bitterness.

We've worked hard and are incredibly proud of the many successes we've enjoyed over the years. The Boston Beer Company has been cited as one of the best companies to work for by Boston Magazine, one of the Best Entry-Level Jobs by The Princeton Review, and our beers have won more awards than any other in history. Jim has been named an \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" by Inc. Magazine. Our brewers keep amazing us with innovative new brews, including Samuel Adams Utopias and our Samuel Adams Barrel Room Collection.\r\n\r\nJim has believed from the beginning that the more you know and understand about beer, the more you'll appreciate a beer like Samuel Adams Boston Lager. To begin that mission, all new employees go through intensive training on everything from ingredients, brewing, and beer styles, to taking care of the beer once it leaves the brewery. We're all beer lovers and protectors of the beer so we're trained how to identify off flavors and how to troubleshoot the causes. The passion for beer continues with an annual homebrew competition that we all take part in.\r\n\r\nOne of our wholesalers once asked Jim why he invested so much in training his people, when ultimately they might leave. Jim smiled and replied without hesitation: \"What if I didn't train them, and they stayed?\"\r\n\r\nEach year, usually in January, everyone gathers together. One of the highlights of the meeting is the beer trivia contest. With a culture so steeped in beer education and knowledge, winning is a pretty big deal.

Effective July 1, 2012, Senate Bill 604 gives commercial breweries in Virginia the right to sell glasses of beer on-site. For more information on Senate Bill 604 and what it means for Virginia breweries, click here. In the case of the beers released with this name, the \"SB\" stands for \"session beer\" referring to ales or lagers of a milder alcohol content (typically lower than 4.0% ABV). The brewers who spent weeks lobbying on behalf of SB 604 with senators and delegates at Virginia's General Assembly plan to release different variations of SB 604 beers that will be session beers only available for consumption on site at their respective breweries. The \"Special Bitter\" version of this beer offered by Hardywood is very sessionable, at 3.8% ABV. A moderate caramel malt character and some fruity notes provide plenty of complexity and flavor to this beer, which beautifully complements citrusy, high alpha American aroma hops. Dry-hopped with slightly peppery horizon hops, this beer displays the high degree of balance that has become a signature of Hardywood's beers.
