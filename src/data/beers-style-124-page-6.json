Our goal is to produce distinctive beers whose quaility is unsurpassed using new and traditional brewing methods.\r\n\r\nWhy \"Burley Oak?\"\r\n\r\nThe inspiration for our name Burley Oak Brewing Company was derived from the name of the town, our traditional brewing methods and the history of our brewhouse. \r\n\r\nBerlin, Maryland in Wikipedia \r\nThe town of Berlin had its start around the 1790s, part of the Burley Plantation, a 300-acre (1.2 km2) land grant dating back to 1677. The name Berlin is believed to be derived from a contraction of \"Burleigh Inn\", a tavern located at the crossroads of the Philadelphia Post Road (now South Main Street) and Sinepuxent Road (Tripoli Street).\r\n\r\nIt just so happens, that our building was originally a Cooperage - making oak barrels to fill with local produce and seafood to ship off to Baltimore in the early 1900's. And we are bringing barrels back to the building, aiding us in the aging of our hand-crafted ales.","website":"http:\/\/www.burleyoak.com\/","established":"2011","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/burleyoak.us8.list-manage.com\/subscribe?u=e9e9f1b229013eb1f9c176a6d&id=08ec5affe2","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:17:12","locations":[{"id":"dB9k9t","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"10016 Old Ocean City Blvd","locality":"Berlin","region":"Maryland","postalCode":"21811","phone":"410-422-8887","website":"http:\/\/www.burleyoak.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday 11am-11pm \r\nThursday, Friday, and Saturday 11am-2am\r\nSunday 12pm - 9pm","latitude":38.3338561,"longitude":-75.2169099,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"y652em","name":"Gingerbread Nitro","nameDisplay":"Gingerbread Nitro","abv":"5.75","ibu":"10","styleId":124,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-02-25 16:34:27","updateDate":"2016-02-25 16:34:27","style":{"id":124,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Herb and Spice Beer","shortName":"Spice Beer","description":"Herb beers use herbs or spices (derived from roots, seeds, fruits, vegetable, flowers, etc.) other than or in addition to hops to create a distinct (ranging from subtle to intense) character, though individual characters of herbs and\/or spices used may not always be identifiable.

The most recent addition to the Elysian empire, Elysian Fields, opened in August 2006. Perched next to Seattle\u2019s two sports arenas, Fields seats 400 and packs the house at lunch and on gamedays.

We don\u2019t want to blow-out your palate, we want you to explore the hidden flavors and understand the complexities of the taste.\r\n\r\nWe love beer. We want you to love beer.\r\n\r\nWe will focus on crafting beers between 4.5% and 7.0% ABV. Our goal is a well-balanced, well-crafted, session beer. We\u2019ll do the hop-thing too, but always with an exciting and culinary-focused angle.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s the other thing. We\u2019re adventurous. San Diego is the brew capital of the world (are we exaggerating here\u2026 NO!) There\u2019s lots of great brewers. We found a few of them and held them down, twisted their arm really hard and asked them to brew something new and out there for us. Then, we found a few chefs who thought brewing was good sport. We helped them with the technical stuff and set them loose with the brew equipment.\r\n\r\nYou\u2019ll see their brew in our taproom\u2026they may have other gigs in the city, and we support their efforts there too. Beer is beer. Drink it here. Drink it there. Drink it anywhere (with apologies to Dr. Seuss).","website":"http:\/\/groundswellbrew.com\/","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/6ODyQZ\/upload_w1rQEV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/6ODyQZ\/upload_w1rQEV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/6ODyQZ\/upload_w1rQEV-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/6ODyQZ\/upload_w1rQEV-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/6ODyQZ\/upload_w1rQEV-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-11-01 16:46:02","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:48:05","locations":[{"id":"0bgPa6","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"6304 Riverdale St.","locality":"San Diego","region":"California","postalCode":"92120","phone":"(619) 820-0961","website":"http:\/\/groundswellbrew.com","latitude":32.7889952,"longitude":-117.0997872,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-11-01 16:46:29","updateDate":"2016-01-04 19:48:22","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"A2mwzF","name":"Habanero Pilsner","nameDisplay":"Habanero Pilsner","description":"Imperial Pilsner Infused with Habanero Peppers.

We knew what we wanted to drink, but we needed some help actually brewing it. So we enlisted our first brewer, took over some warehouse space on the Boston waterfront, and began introducing fresh, local craft beer to Boston drinkers. We tried to do it in a way that captured the spirit of fun that had brought us to beer in the first place. From that warehouse, surrounded by fish companies on the docks of South Boston (neighboring what is now the Seaport District), we couldn\u2019t imagine that craft brewing would become what it has today.  \r\n\r\nWe still remember our days on the other side of the bar, and have spent as much time spreading the joy of beer drinking as we have focusing on recipes, ingredients, and brewing equipment. Hopefully our sense of gratitude is reflected in both the quality of the beer and the spirit of fun and enjoyment surrounding our beer and breweries. We invite all of you to visit our Boston brewery, where it all began, and our beautiful brewery in Windsor, Vermont.","website":"http:\/\/www.harpoonbrewery.com\/","established":"1986","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/RzvedX\/upload_AbOUmA-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/RzvedX\/upload_AbOUmA-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/RzvedX\/upload_AbOUmA-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/RzvedX\/upload_AbOUmA-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/RzvedX\/upload_AbOUmA-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:57","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:47:47","locations":[{"id":"AGRvvY","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"336 Ruth Carney Drive","locality":"Windsor","region":"Vermont","postalCode":"05089","phone":"802-674-5491","website":"http:\/\/www.harpoonbrewery.com\/","latitude":43.5130201,"longitude":-72.4016913,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1986","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:57","updateDate":"2014-10-06 15:45:55","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"9aSjFg","name":"Boston","streetAddress":"306 Northern Avenue","locality":"Boston","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"02210","phone":"1-888-HARPOON","website":"http:\/\/www.harpoonbrewery.com","latitude":42.3465,"longitude":-71.033843,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1986","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2014-09-26 14:01:43","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Oa5lvx","name":"Harvest Pumpkin Ale","nameDisplay":"Harvest Pumpkin Ale","description":"In 1995, we crafted our first autumn seasonal\u2014Pumpkin Ale.

Under hopping often, but not always, allows the spice or herb to contribute to the flavor profile. Positive evaluations are significantly based on perceived balance of flavors. Note: Chili-flavored beers that emphasize heat rather than chili flavor should be entered as a \"spiced\" beer.  A statement by the brewer explaining what herbs or spices are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. Specifying a style upon which the beer is based may help evaluation. If this beer is a classic style with an herb or spice, the brewer should specify the classic style. If no Chocolate or Coffee category exists in a competition, then chocolate and coffee beers should be entered in this category.","ibuMin":"5","ibuMax":"70","abvMin":"2.5","abvMax":"12","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"50","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.03","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:45"},"breweries":[{"id":"2vWetL","name":"Little Harpeth Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Little Harpeth","website":"http:\/\/littleharpethbrewing.com\/#","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/2vWetL\/upload_cCxvSP-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/2vWetL\/upload_cCxvSP-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/2vWetL\/upload_cCxvSP-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/2vWetL\/upload_cCxvSP-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/2vWetL\/upload_cCxvSP-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-07-15 17:27:55","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:13:41","locations":[{"id":"oDXzxe","name":"Little Harpeth Brewing Company","streetAddress":"30 Oldham St","locality":"Nashville","region":"TN","postalCode":"37213","website":"http:\/\/littleharpethbrewing.com\/index.php","latitude":36.1741119,"longitude":-86.776089,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2015-09-24 18:41:30","updateDate":"2015-09-24 18:44:49","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"QXGo75","name":"Little Harpeth Brewing Company","streetAddress":"30 Oldham St","locality":"Nashville","region":"Tennessee","postalCode":"37213","website":"http:\/\/littleharpethbrewing.com\/index.php","latitude":36.1741119,"longitude":-86.776089,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-09-24 18:42:17","updateDate":"2015-11-20 15:50:17","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
