Jason Hendricks and Jason Schlaff met in the fall of  2009.  They didn\u2019t know then that their friendship would bloom, but when it did, a brewery would be the flower.\r\n\r\nThe Jasons started humbly with a five gallon pot, a homebrew starter kit, and an idea of what good should be.  The first brew was just ok, an American Ale extract kit that did not allow for any artistry.  They quickly realized they needed to switch things up in order to attain the flavors they wanted.  So, the two amateurs ventured into the world of all-grain brewing.  The first mash tun, a cooler, the first brew, a porter.  Jason and Jason had their first failure.  \r\n\r\nPoor taste and terrible color ruined their tongues but not their spirit.  They could do much much better.   Schlaff, an avid reader and researcher, dove head first into every book he could find.  Hendricks scoured the internet and talked to every expert he could find.  Armed with brains full of knowledge the two gents embarked on the brewing adventure again.  \r\n\r\nThe second beer, a blonde ale, crafted with the newfound comprehension they acquired.  After a two weeks of eager anticipation, success!  The Jasons now had the knowledge, the drive, and the skill.  Each ale after that was instant hit among their friends and family.  Gary Schlaff, Jason\u2019s distinguished father, joined the endeavor in 2013.  Gary, a marketing genius, is nearing retirement and has decided to throw his business knowledge into the mix.\r\n\r\nThe brewery itself will not serve or prepare food.  Patrons will be allowed to bring in outside food, as well as have food delivered to them at the brewery.\r\n\r\nWe strive to be as sustainable and as local as possible.  The brewhouse and fermenters will be purchased for Psycho Brew LLC of Greenville, MI.  Our hops will be purchased from the many growers in Michigan.  Our spent grain will be sold to local farmers instead of going to waste in a landfill.  As a side project, we will also used the spent grain to made organic dog treats.","website":"http:\/\/fbcbrewing.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ohbgYE\/upload_WwIcxm-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ohbgYE\/upload_WwIcxm-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ohbgYE\/upload_WwIcxm-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ohbgYE\/upload_WwIcxm-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ohbgYE\/upload_WwIcxm-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-11-24 00:48:05","updateDate":"2016-04-10 21:15:30","locations":[{"id":"fSqavF","name":"Farmington Brewing Company","streetAddress":"33336 Grand River","locality":"Farmington","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"48336","phone":"(248) 957-9543","website":"http:\/\/fbcbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Wed:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\nThu:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\nFri:  4:00pm - 11:00pm\nSat:  2:00pm - 11:00pm\nSun:  2:00pm - 9:00pm\n\n","latitude":42.464946,"longitude":-83.375958,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2014","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-11-24 00:51:59","updateDate":"2016-04-10 21:15:14","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"diTVaN","name":"Berliner Weiss","nameDisplay":"Berliner Weiss","styleId":46,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-06-23 19:49:00","updateDate":"2016-06-23 19:49:00","style":{"id":46,"categoryId":4,"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Berliner-Style Weisse (Wheat)","shortName":"Berlinerweisse","description":"This is very pale in color and the lightest of all the German wheat beers.

Starting modestly, Angel City quickly became a leader in the LA craft beer scene. In 2004 Angel City bought an 8,000 barrel German-made brewery in Alpine Village near Los Angeles on EBay! and lovingly restored the facility. In late 2010, Angel City relocated the brewery to the historic John A. Roebling Building in LA\u2019s Downtown Arts District. The vision was, and remains, to give this great city a great brewery.\r\n\r\nOn January 5, 2012, Angel City Brewery was acquired by Alchemy & Science, a craft beer collaboration led by Alan Newman and Stacey Steinmetz, formerly of Magic Hat Brewing Company.\r\n\r\nSince January 2012, we\u2019ve undergone massive renovations, including the addition of a new mustache bar. We began brewing in April of 2012, and started popping up in local LA bars and restaurants soon thereafter.\r\n\r\nIn February 2013, we opened the doors to the Brewery and Public House, but with limited hours as construction continued. We offer an ever-rotating selection of Angel City beer on tap, which includes a number of beers exclusively available at the Brewery. In addition to pints and flights, we offer brewery tours, events, and a great place to gather with friends. We have a small on-site retail store as well. Outside food is always welcome, and there are a number of great locations in our neighborhood that offer take out. In addition to the neighborhood cuisine, our parking lot has become a hot spot for food trucks, with one parked outside nearly every night we\u2019re open. On May 5th, 2013 we had our grand opening with our first ever Heritage Festival. We\u2019re now seven days a week for brewery tours and tastings, and we have full roster of weekly events.","website":"http:\/\/www.angelcitybrewing.com\/","established":"1997","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0ZIlVA\/upload_q87thj-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0ZIlVA\/upload_q87thj-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0ZIlVA\/upload_q87thj-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0ZIlVA\/upload_q87thj-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0ZIlVA\/upload_q87thj-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:15:22","locations":[{"id":"5tw2Iw","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"216 S Alameda St","locality":"Los Angeles","region":"California","postalCode":"90013","phone":"310-329-8881","website":"http:\/\/www.angelcitybrewing.com\/","latitude":34.0466054,"longitude":-118.2378181,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1997","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"oYxWzS","name":"Berliner Weisse","nameDisplay":"Berliner Weisse","abv":"3","styleId":46,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-08-23 13:23:33","updateDate":"2015-08-23 13:23:33","style":{"id":46,"categoryId":4,"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Berliner-Style Weisse (Wheat)","shortName":"Berlinerweisse","description":"This is very pale in color and the lightest of all the German wheat beers.

His dad informed him of a trademark he had won in 2004 and subsequently protected in contest from Anheuser Busch. The name was TailGate Beer.\r\n\r\nTim thought TailGate Beer was something special. As an avid sports fan and tailgater, Tim implored Wesley to take his homebrews that people loved drinking and brew TailGate Beer! Wesley, having put himself through college at San Diego State University, grew up modestly. The gift of TailGate Beer was a generous one but, unlike some tales of entrepreneurism, didn\u2019t come with startup funds.\r\n\r\nThey both agreed the name was solid and the marketing would one day be fun, but Wesley was emphatic that the beer had to be excellent. From there, Wesley took what he liked to brew, and brewed in Southern California. All initial beers were brewed and packaged in kegs and glass bottles. Wesley entered into the Great American Beer Festival in 2007 and although no formal awards were won, TailGate Beer was a hit! This drew lots of attention from beer fans from all over the country. The common response was \u201cgreat beer!\u201d and \u201cgreat name!\u201d So with confirmation of Wesley\u2019s biggest apprehension \u2013 people loved the beer \u2013 TailGate Beer was born.","website":"http:\/\/www.tailgatebeer.com\/","established":"2007","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/tailgatebeer.com\/tailgate-newsletter\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/PuOZUW\/upload_R7nvG9-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/PuOZUW\/upload_R7nvG9-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/PuOZUW\/upload_R7nvG9-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/PuOZUW\/upload_R7nvG9-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/PuOZUW\/upload_R7nvG9-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:59:49","locations":[{"id":"XqWTM7","name":"TailGate Beer","streetAddress":"7300 Charlotte Pike","locality":"Nashville","region":"Tennessee","postalCode":"37209","phone":"615-457-1424","website":"http:\/\/www.tailgatebeer.com","latitude":36.119999,"longitude":-86.919825,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2007","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2015-06-11 14:29:16","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"HLn50c","name":"Berliner Weisse","nameDisplay":"Berliner Weisse","description":"Beltway\u2019s Berliner Weisse is modeled after the traditional German style using the finest wheat and pale malts.

It was there that the Pipeworks boys lived and worked with Urbain Coutteau owner and brewer at the De Struise Brewery.

The sourness is created by souring the wort prior to boiling and fermentation (unlike Belgian-style sours which sour during fermentation and have active bacteria in them when packaged).

The sour and malt flavors balance well all the way through creating a very refreshing beverage, akin to drinking a tart lemonade or limeade. For a beer with just over 3.5%, it creates a big experience for the palate.\r\n\r\nTraditionally this beer is enjoyed either straight or with raspberry or woodruff syrup to sweeten it (and turn it red or green, respectively).","abv":"3.5","styleId":46,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-06-06 13:58:21","updateDate":"2016-06-06 13:58:21","style":{"id":46,"categoryId":4,"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Berliner-Style Weisse (Wheat)","shortName":"Berlinerweisse","description":"This is very pale in color and the lightest of all the German wheat beers.

Our goal is to brew world class beers and deliver them to our customers as fresh as possible making them the best beers in Texas and Louisiana. Our customers are beer lovers - people that appreciate great, full-flavored beers.\r\n\r\nOur small crew does everything at the brewery: brew the beer, filter the beer, keg the beer, bottle the beer, sell the beer and drink the beer. For us, this is a passion, not a job. We believe that this comes through in the beers we make. Our beers have soul.\r\n\r\nWe brew several different beers; some are year round, some are seasonal and a few are single batch brews. They are available in bars, restaurants, grocery stores, liquor stores and warehouse stores throughout Texas and Louisiana.\r\n\r\nOur first keg of beer was shipped on June 9, 1994. Founded by Brock Wagner and Kevin Bartol, we chose Houston because, other than living here, this was the largest city in the country that did not have a microbrewery. Brock was a longtime homebrewer and had considered opening a brewery as far back as college, although that was quickly dismissed as a silly idea. Seven years after graduating, Brock revisited the idea, enlisted Kevin's help and the brewery was off and running. Kevin has since left the business after a bitter battle. (Just kidding - but don't you wish people wrote that when it was the truth?).\r\n\r\nPlease visit us if you are in Houston. We have a public open house every weekday at 3:00 PM and every Saturday starting at 11:00 AM.\r\n\r\nCheers!","website":"http:\/\/www.saintarnold.com\/","established":"1994","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/visitor.constantcontact.com\/manage\/optin?v=001uBxRG66eq3ajbdfZ6GjL91di7O20EmmX","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/H3UW27\/upload_rnr6XH-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/H3UW27\/upload_rnr6XH-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/H3UW27\/upload_rnr6XH-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/H3UW27\/upload_rnr6XH-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/H3UW27\/upload_rnr6XH-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:56:40","locations":[{"id":"jPbb33","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2000 Lyons Avenue","locality":"Houston","region":"Texas","postalCode":"77020","phone":"713-686-9494","website":"http:\/\/www.saintarnold.com\/","latitude":29.7715192,"longitude":-95.3484972,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1994","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"HM5BbV","name":"Bonnie the Rare","nameDisplay":"Bonnie the Rare","description":"A traditional Berlin-style sour wheat beer, based on the meticulous research of beer historian Ron Pattinson.
