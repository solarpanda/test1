Nick and Simon brewed intense balanced beers that were and still remain \u201cnot normal\u201d by conventional standards.\r\n\r\nIn November of 2005, after receiving numerous visitors to the brewery over the years, Three Floyds opened its own brewpub at the production facility. What was once office space is now a refuge for the craft beer enthusiast. With all the Three Floyds mainstays, seasonal offerings, special small batch beers and many guest beers it is a mecca for craft beer. The pub also has a full service kitchen providing pub fare of the best quality supported by a 3000 square foot organic herb and vegetable garden.","website":"http:\/\/www.3floyds.com","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/iodDki\/upload_Va4zor-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/iodDki\/upload_Va4zor-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/iodDki\/upload_Va4zor-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/iodDki\/upload_Va4zor-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/iodDki\/upload_Va4zor-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2016-01-15 16:17:52","locations":[{"id":"71LkGn","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"9750 Indiana Parkway","locality":"Munster","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"46321","phone":"1-219-922-3565","website":"http:\/\/www.threefloydspub.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nTue:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nWed:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nThu:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nFri:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nSat:  12:00pm - 2:00am\r\nSun:  12:00pm - 12:00am","latitude":41.535541,"longitude":-87.516686,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2015-06-18 14:42:36","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"GoDmMT","name":"Munster","streetAddress":"9750 Indiana Parkway","locality":"Munster","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"46321","phone":"219-922-4425","website":"http:\/\/www.3floyds.com\/","latitude":41.535536,"longitude":-87.516687,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:16","updateDate":"2015-04-01 18:55:51","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"OEb69h","name":"Rusty Gun","nameDisplay":"Rusty Gun","description":"Hops hit first with a smooth finish.

After homebrewing on the family farm for years, homebrewer Cory Schroeder teamed up with Jim Wiesender to found the brewery in 1999.\r\n\r\nUsing equipment scrounged from various industries, such as a converted pudding tank for the brew kettle, the pair launched a successful business, brewing the beer just steps away from the chicken coop and a busy dairy farm.\r\n\r\nTheir Sand Creek Golden Ale and English Style Special Ale, available only on draft and in half-gallon growlers, soon developed a reputation throughout Wisconsin's many brew fests. With a capacity of only about 150 barrels per year, the brewery, now with a third owner on board, quickly outgrew the little farm shed converted into a brewhouse.\r\n\r\nHoping to remain in the Dunn\/St. Croix counties area, the company looked for a suitable place to relocate, but came up empty handed. Then opportunity knocked in the form of a phone call one evening from their friend in Black River Falls, Pioneer brewing's brewmaster Todd Krueger. The brewery was for sale.\r\n\r\nIn March of 2004 the combined forces of the two breweries officially formed the new Sand Creek Brewing Co. of Black River Falls, Wisconsin.","website":"http:\/\/www.sandcreekbrewing.com\/","established":"1999","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gsADrL\/upload_RPFu23-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gsADrL\/upload_RPFu23-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gsADrL\/upload_RPFu23-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gsADrL\/upload_RPFu23-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gsADrL\/upload_RPFu23-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:56:58","locations":[{"id":"TSKxwK","name":"Sand Creek Brewing Co","streetAddress":"320 Pierce St","extendedAddress":"Box 187","locality":"Black River Falls","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"54615","phone":"(715) 284-7553","website":"http:\/\/www.sandcreekbrewing.com\/","latitude":44.2830622,"longitude":-90.7913227,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1998","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2015-12-04 17:57:24","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"TrZVJC","name":"So I Bitter","nameDisplay":"So I Bitter","description":"Light in body and color this ESB is crisp and very drinkable.

Beers were brewed on Sunday mornings, where biscuity malt and hop aromas would waft through their house waking up their two other housemates. Before too long they realised they wanted to brew these beers every day of the week and share their passion of brewing and drinking good beer with the rest of London.\r\n\r\nRecipes were put together, brewing vessels were purchased, an industrial premises was let and the brewery in Summerstown, London, was born. Alex Bull and Chris Mills, the co-founders, had put together a microbrewery based in South-West London which created small-batch full-flavoured ales. Initially, four flagship ales were brewed for cask ale and bottles, with new on-off limited edition beers being created every month.\r\n\r\nWithin 18 months of operation the brewery was expanded with new vessels installed and a Brewery Tap was added. The expansion enabled keg beers to be produced, including a variety of lagers and stronger craft keg beers, with our Brewery Tap serving our beers directly from where they are brewed.\u00ad\r\nWe now produce four flagship ales and at least three varying seasonal ales every month. We also produce five flagship bottle beers which are sold to many of London\u2019s finest beer bottle shops and also have two flagship keg beer(our Crafty Lager 5.3% & Wolfie Smith Amber Ale 5.2%) with four seasonal kegs beers.","website":"http:\/\/www.bythehorns.co.uk\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/oCMAvB\/upload_Y5HzOD-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/oCMAvB\/upload_Y5HzOD-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/oCMAvB\/upload_Y5HzOD-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/oCMAvB\/upload_Y5HzOD-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/oCMAvB\/upload_Y5HzOD-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-12-13 22:12:28","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:02:16","locations":[{"id":"yN5FBR","name":"By The Horns Brewing Co","streetAddress":"25 Summerstown, Wandsworth","extendedAddress":"London","locality":"London","postalCode":"SW17 0BQ","phone":"+44 203 417 7338","website":"http:\/\/www.bythehorns.co.uk\/","latitude":51.4325056,"longitude":-0.1847287,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"GB","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-12-13 22:13:50","updateDate":"2014-12-23 12:31:07","country":{"isoCode":"GB","name":"UNITED KINGDOM","displayName":"United Kingdom","isoThree":"GBR","numberCode":826,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Nzo9El","name":"The Skippers Bitter","nameDisplay":"The Skippers Bitter","abv":"5.2","glasswareId":5,"styleId":4,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-07 21:56:29","updateDate":"2013-05-11 15:18:24","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"style":{"id":4,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Special Bitter or Best Bitter","shortName":"Special Bitter","description":"Special bitter is more robust than ordinary bitter.

However, we do believe in experimentation to develop unique beer styles and varieties. We invite you to enjoy one of our beers in our brewery or take some home for a true Capital experience.\r\n\r\n\r\nCapital Brewery was established with an important mission in mind, and we continually build on that sentiment, by delivering a unique experience and award winning beers to meet the changing demands of the craft beer community.","website":"http:\/\/www.capitalbrewery.com\/","established":"1984","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/visitor.r20.constantcontact.com\/manage\/optin?v=001QKOUjm76P7aUowbU3bchMmLlIKSnJ2dJN7B3SnkK1I-Dde4Q3J1O8o_MbR3cMmc9UYntPMmGLsuW8he0ZzVEDAGaJ2Jp9MbLzBs7xf-IS0iQq4FuDhj02K5Wn2ywuNqT","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/tWHPRC\/upload_S3hy0Z-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/tWHPRC\/upload_S3hy0Z-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/tWHPRC\/upload_S3hy0Z-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/tWHPRC\/upload_S3hy0Z-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/tWHPRC\/upload_S3hy0Z-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:50","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:42:36","locations":[{"id":"1g0RBG","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"7734 Terrace Avenue","locality":"Middleton","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"53562","phone":"608-836-7100","website":"http:\/\/www.capital-brewery.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Tue:  4:00pm - 9:00pm\nWed:  4:00pm - 9:00pm\nThu:  4:00pm - 9:00pm\nFri:  4:00pm - 9:00pm\nSat:  12:00pm - 5:00pm\nSun:  12:00pm - 5:00pm\n\nMonday: CLOSED TO THE PUBLIC\r\nTuesday: 4:00pm-9:00pm\r\nWednesday: 4:00pm-9:00pm\r\nThursday: 4:00pm-9:00pm \r\nFriday: 4:00pm-9:00pm\r\nSaturday: 12:00pm-5:00pm\r\nSunday: 12:00pm-5:00pm","latitude":43.094848,"longitude":-89.5165838,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1984","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:50","updateDate":"2014-09-29 20:12:03","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"qaD6jJ","name":"Wren's Bitter","nameDisplay":"Wren's Bitter","description":"don\u2019t let the name fool you, this is a smooth sessionable English Pale Ale.

John and Aaron met at church through their kids, who were (and still are) best friends. The kids would plan brew days at Aaron's house so they could play together, and John and Aaron could brew. John had started brewing on a beer kit and Aaron taught him the art of brewing all grain beers on his home made system. The planning of Tin Cannon came through many days of brewing with together in Aaron's dedicated brew room, or in John's garage. Aaron is an engineering guru and built a tremendous 10 gallon brewing system on his own, to include an electric master control panel. John likes to tinker and build stuff, and built stir plates, mash tuns, a kegerator and the like. When two innovative minds get together, they bring ingenuity, focus, style and creativity to each beer they brew.

We've been heavily influenced by so many beers particularly by breweries from the 1800's that have now long-since closed their doors. Heritage is important to us and all our beers are made with a definitive nod to the brewers and breweries of former times. If we can develop great beer and give people a history lesson at the same time we would be two very happy brewers!\r\n\r\nWe regularly produce a range of four core beers (North, South, West and East) and North Pole is brewed for the festive season. We also brew a new limited edition beer each month, produced in small batches and aimed the drinker wanting something just a little bit different.
