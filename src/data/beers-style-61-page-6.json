In 1930 they build a new malt house and a foeder room and in 1937 a new brewing room, a fermentation room, a tank room and a bottling hall. Their focus still is on the traditional low fermentation beers: bock, export and lager.\r\nLuc, the son of Paul, goes to brewery school and learns the trade as an apprentice in Germany and Wallonia.\r\nLuc takes over in 1953, changes the name in brewery Vanhonsebrouck and decides to stop brewing lager and focuses on \u2018old Flemish brown\u2019, Bacchus.\r\nIn 1957 he starts with lambic and later on with Gueuze and Kriek under the name Saint Louis. Brewery Vanhonsebrouck becomes the second largest brewery of Gueuze, thanks to the shirt sponsoring of FC Bruges, European soccer finalist in 1976 and 1978. The production of Gueuze Saint Louis booms to a record in that time of 1 million kg of malt.\r\nIn 1980 Luc responds to the growing demand for heavy blond beers and launches Brigand, named after the farmer\u2019s uprising against French occupation in 1798.\r\nIn 1986 the family buys Ingelmunster castle and 3 years later, the famous Kasteel(bier) is launched. It starts with \u2018Donker\u2019, than \u2018Tripel\u2019, \u2018Rouge\u2019 and \u2018Blond\u2019.\r\nIn 2009, the 5th generation, Xavier Van Honsebrouck, takes over.\r\nHis first achievement is the \u2018Cuv\u00e9e du Ch\u00e2teau\u2019.\r\nIn 2012 the high exclusive Trignac follows and in 2013 Kasteel Hoppy.\r\nIn commemoration of a 100 years World War I, \u2018Passchendaele\u2019, a Belgian Top Blond, with only 5.2\u00b0 alcohol is launched in 2013.

We knew what we wanted to drink, but we needed some help actually brewing it. So we enlisted our first brewer, took over some warehouse space on the Boston waterfront, and began introducing fresh, local craft beer to Boston drinkers. We tried to do it in a way that captured the spirit of fun that had brought us to beer in the first place. From that warehouse, surrounded by fish companies on the docks of South Boston (neighboring what is now the Seaport District), we couldn\u2019t imagine that craft brewing would become what it has today.  \r\n\r\nWe still remember our days on the other side of the bar, and have spent as much time spreading the joy of beer drinking as we have focusing on recipes, ingredients, and brewing equipment. Hopefully our sense of gratitude is reflected in both the quality of the beer and the spirit of fun and enjoyment surrounding our beer and breweries.

Rogue's first brewpub was located in Ashland, Oregon and was a 10bbl brewsystem. Rogue opened a second brewpub, 15bbl brewsystem, in May 1989 located in Newport, Oregon. Rogue closed its Ashland operation in 1997, after the great flood destroyed the place. In 1991, the 15bbl system, named Howard after John Maier's former boss, from the Newport brewpub was transferred across the bay to the current brewery and upgraded to a 30bbl system. In 1998 Rogue bought a 50bbl brewsystem, named Kobe. Kobe is the only brewsystem in use. Tours: We offer brewery tours every day at 3 pm (followed by a distillery tour at 4pm). Go up to the bar inside the brewery (Brewers on the Bay) and check in with the bartender and the tour will commence. Please call ahead if you have a large group and or to verify the tour time...Brewer's on the Bay phone is 541-867-3664.
