We are committed to the continued growth and revitalization of our neighborhood by being an interactive and supportive partner to the arts and business communities, as well as the burgeoning craft beer movement in Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nAngel City Brewing was founded in 1997. Starting modestly, Angel City quickly became a leader in the LA craft beer scene. In 2004 Angel City bought an 8,000 barrel German-made brewery in Alpine Village near Los Angeles on EBay! and lovingly restored the facility. In late 2010, Angel City relocated the brewery to the historic John A. Roebling Building in LA\u2019s Downtown Arts District. The vision was, and remains, to give this great city a great brewery.\r\n\r\nOn January 5, 2012, Angel City Brewery was acquired by Alchemy & Science, a craft beer collaboration led by Alan Newman and Stacey Steinmetz, formerly of Magic Hat Brewing Company.\r\n\r\nSince January 2012, we\u2019ve undergone massive renovations, including the addition of a new mustache bar. We began brewing in April of 2012, and started popping up in local LA bars and restaurants soon thereafter.\r\n\r\nIn February 2013, we opened the doors to the Brewery and Public House, but with limited hours as construction continued. We offer an ever-rotating selection of Angel City beer on tap, which includes a number of beers exclusively available at the Brewery. In addition to pints and flights, we offer brewery tours, events, and a great place to gather with friends. We have a small on-site retail store as well. Outside food is always welcome, and there are a number of great locations in our neighborhood that offer take out.

Ever since the beginnings of the American Beer Renaissance, I have wanted to brew my own great tasting beer and make it available to the beer drinking public and help people learn about and appreciate beer. Coming from Oshkosh, Wisconsin, beer brewing is in my veins.\r\n\r\nTwelve years ago my wonderful wife bought me the \"everything but the kitchen sink\" homebrew kit and it all started. After a few extract brew sessions, I built a 15 gallon brew sculpture and graduated to all-grain brewing, and things really got serious. Now after over 200 brews, BCB is in business!\r\n\r\nThe brewery is small, we call it a Nano-Brewery, we are hidden in the middle of 38 acres of woods in the heart of North Carolina. Most everything is recycled or made in-house. The Brew-House is an old 20' steel cargo container, the Beer-Garden brew patio is recycled flagstone and granite, nestled under spreading oaks and pines, our cooling water is stored rain water from a cistern, the chickens just love the spent mash. All the ingredients are as fresh as possible, some are even home grown. American malts, hops, and yeast are the mainstay of our beers. The water is from our 450' well and is just as pure and clean as can be. Our small batch brewing lets us assure you that each keg or bottle of beer will be as fresh and wonderful as though we were brewing it for ourselves to drink.","website":"http:\/\/www.bearcreekbrews.com\/","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/9GewxD\/upload_lRNESO-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/9GewxD\/upload_lRNESO-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/9GewxD\/upload_lRNESO-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/9GewxD\/upload_lRNESO-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/9GewxD\/upload_lRNESO-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-21 12:55:26","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:52:57","locations":[{"id":"EfLTd6","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"10538 NC 902 Hwy","locality":"Bear Creek","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"27207","phone":"(919) 200-3930","website":"http:\/\/www.bearcreekbrews.com\/","latitude":35.6518126,"longitude":-79.3329623,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"nano","locationTypeDisplay":"Nano Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2014-03-21 12:56:05","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"qz4HmX","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"10538 NC 902 Hwy","locality":"Bear Creek","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"27207","phone":"(919) 200-3930","website":"http:\/\/www.bearcreekbrews.com\/","latitude":35.6518126,"longitude":-79.3329623,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"nano","locationTypeDisplay":"Nano Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-21 12:56:06","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"jNPd7w","name":"WIT","nameDisplay":"WIT","description":"Belgian inspired ultra-pale wheat ale that's brewed with coriander seed and bitter orange peel.

The brewery addition was added back in 1994 but operated quietly as Oregon\u2019s smallest micobrewery for many years. With the more recent additions of David Vohden and Cameron Moore, we have refocused our efforts on producing and sharing a constantly changing lineup of fresh quality beers from right here in the Great Pacific Northwest. Vohden oversees all brewery operations which he has met with great success. Most recently of which was a Silver Medal for our Woozy Weizenbock at the Great American Beer Festival. We see our recent efforts bringing exciting results.\r\n\r\nWe reached completion of a 3,500 sq ft. addition to expand our brew house in the Summer of 2013. Vohden and Moore finished installation of the glycol system just in time to quench the thirsty demands of the 2013 Oregon Brewers Festival with a crowd pleasing Traverse Cherry Wit Bier. In addition to the brew house expansion we have added four 7-barrel fermentation tanks for an eventual all around 7-barrel system upgrade. A Cellar was also added for barrel aging, sours, and other delectable experiments.\r\n\r\nAlthough most of the square footage was utilized for brewing purposes. We were sure to save some space for all you beer drinkers. A mezzanine gives an elevated view down onto the open brewery floor. If you happen to drop by on a brew day you too can enjoy the sweet sensory overload and watch the action (or lack thereof). A beautiful black walnut bar, fully stocked with 13 drafts faucets was added to accompany the additional seating area and to cater to private events. However, the new bar and brewery seating are always open to patrons except in the case of private events. Another 60\u2032 TV was added to the new mezzanine area and we continue to play all major sporting events.

So when brothers Patrick and Daniel Conway opened Great Lakes Brewing Company on September 6, 1988, it not only signaled a new era in Cleveland brewing, it was also the first microbrewery in the state of Ohio.

The story goes, Wesley was approached by his father, Tim, one day about what he was going to do with his life. As an ocean lifeguard and co-owner of a bar, Wesley thought he had it made. His dad informed him of a trademark he had won in 2004 and subsequently protected in contest from Anheuser Busch. The name was TailGate Beer.\r\n\r\nTim thought TailGate Beer was something special. As an avid sports fan and tailgater, Tim implored Wesley to take his homebrews that people loved drinking and brew TailGate Beer! Wesley, having put himself through college at San Diego State University, grew up modestly. The gift of TailGate Beer was a generous one but, unlike some tales of entrepreneurism, didn\u2019t come with startup funds.\r\n\r\nThey both agreed the name was solid and the marketing would one day be fun, but Wesley was emphatic that the beer had to be excellent. From there, Wesley took what he liked to brew, and brewed in Southern California. All initial beers were brewed and packaged in kegs and glass bottles. Wesley entered into the Great American Beer Festival in 2007 and although no formal awards were won, TailGate Beer was a hit! This drew lots of attention from beer fans from all over the country. The common response was \u201cgreat beer!\u201d and \u201cgreat name!\u201d So with confirmation of Wesley\u2019s biggest apprehension \u2013 people loved the beer \u2013 TailGate Beer was born.","website":"http:\/\/www.tailgatebeer.com\/","established":"2007","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/tailgatebeer.com\/tailgate-newsletter\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/PuOZUW\/upload_R7nvG9-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/PuOZUW\/upload_R7nvG9-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/PuOZUW\/upload_R7nvG9-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/PuOZUW\/upload_R7nvG9-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/PuOZUW\/upload_R7nvG9-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:59:49","locations":[{"id":"XqWTM7","name":"TailGate Beer","streetAddress":"7300 Charlotte Pike","locality":"Nashville","region":"Tennessee","postalCode":"37209","phone":"615-457-1424","website":"http:\/\/www.tailgatebeer.com","latitude":36.119999,"longitude":-86.919825,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2007","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2015-06-11 14:29:16","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"QKagMo","name":"Witbier","nameDisplay":"Witbier","description":"The wheat beer is brewed from Emelisse in German style in which a substantial portion of the barley is substituted for wheat.
