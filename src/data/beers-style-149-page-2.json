(In North America hard cider is an alcoholic drink made from fermented apple juice.) Carefully crafted from the best apples grown on our family farm and nearby orchards, our ciders are made with 100% pure apple juice.\r\n\r\nLocated on the picturesque island of Prince Edward County in Southeastern Ontario, our tasting room and retail store welcomes visitors from May to November. Come visit us or look for County Cider Co. products at restaurants, bars and LCBO stores\r\n\r\nThe County Cider Company is located on Ontario\u2019s island of Prince Edward County. Most famous for the giant sand dunes and golden beaches of Sandbanks Provincial Park, the County also enjoys a dramatic history.\r\n\r\nFollowing the American Revolution of 1776 the Township of Marysburgh\u2014home to the County Cider Co.\u2014was one of many established for the settlement of United Empire Loyalists. Named in honour of Princess Mary, a daughter of King George III, it became home to a small group of disbanded German mercenaries under former Lieutenant Baron von Reitzenstein. This party, numbering about 40 persons, was one of the earliest German-speaking groups to settle in Ontario. By October 1784 they had begun to clear and cultivate the land. Henry David and his wife Elizabeth were among these early settlers and it was in 1830, that their son Conrad David, was given title to the lot, which the County Cider Co. now calls home.\r\n\r\nconradhouseToday, the 1832 Conrad David House is an area landmark. Set on the brow of the Waupoos escarpment, the stone house is an excellent example of Regency Cottage architecture. It features dramatic French doors, over-sized windows and veranda as well as a hipped roof. Next door, the property\u2019s picturesque 1832 stone barn houses the County Cider Co.\u2019s tasting room and retail store.

Owner\/Brewers Nick Anderson and Dan Chang started the company in 2004 with the help of a third partner, Robbie Stair after relocating to Minneapolis from Seattle. Robbie owned a farm in scenic Maiden Rock, WI just above the confluence of the Rush River and Lake Pepin. After converting a pole barn into a fully functioning brewery, the trio produced a limited quantity of draft-only beers while steadily building a reputation  for brewing high quality ales. After two and a half years of growth, it became evident that bottled beer was the next move to be made. Luckily, the town of River Falls, WI came to the table with an offer to build a custom building for a brand new brewery. In 2007, the new facility opened its doors with the addition of a refurbished bottling line, and additional fermenters. The new Rush River brewery was now poised to increase production and distributorship. We now have ten distributors in two states and produce nine brands including seasonals. Our small size still allows us to experiment with new styles, while the larger capacity for brewing and storage keep our regular brands flowing out the door.","website":"http:\/\/www.rushriverbeer.com","established":"2004","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wpQqy4\/upload_ws1vwp-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wpQqy4\/upload_ws1vwp-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wpQqy4\/upload_ws1vwp-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wpQqy4\/upload_ws1vwp-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wpQqy4\/upload_ws1vwp-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:56:30","locations":[{"id":"hHD54O","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"990 Antler Court","locality":"River Falls","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"54022","phone":"1-715-426-2054","latitude":44.8902357,"longitude":-92.6377675,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"IClVwy","name":"Hard Cider","nameDisplay":"Hard Cider","description":"This is our flagship product using a blend of apples from Samascott Orchards.

Although the farm was fully operational and proving to be a success, the goods produced were sold on mainly a wholesale level to a Grand Rapids area packing house. Beginning in, 2010, we decided to expand our business and our dream. This is where the 3rd, 4th, and 5th generation of Sietsema Orchards & Cider Mill hope to thrive and grow. We are committed to providing quality produce, and by opening our doors to the public, providing a family farm experience that we hope you enjoy here in West Michigan.","website":"http:\/\/www.sietsemaorchards.com\/","established":"1954","mailingListUrl":"info@sietsemaorchards.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/hTqdRR\/upload_749LZL-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/hTqdRR\/upload_749LZL-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/hTqdRR\/upload_749LZL-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/hTqdRR\/upload_749LZL-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/hTqdRR\/upload_749LZL-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-11-03 17:23:04","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:01:03","locations":[{"id":"G9QOj4","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"8540 2 Mile Rd NE","locality":"Ada","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49301","hoursOfOperation":"September Hours:\r\nThursday & Friday 10am-6pm\r\nSaturday 9am-6pm\r\n\r\nOctober Hours:\r\nTuesday-Friday\r\n10am-6pm\r\nSaturday\r\n9am-6pm\r\n\r\nNovember Hours:\r\nThursday & Friday:\r\n10am-6pm\r\n\r\nSaturday:\r\n9-6","latitude":42.997611,"longitude":-85.459116,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"cidery","locationTypeDisplay":"Cidery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-11-03 17:25:32","updateDate":"2014-11-03 17:25:32","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"yR5vgK","name":"Hard Cider Dry","nameDisplay":"Hard Cider Dry","description":"Brewed using the original process for ancient Celtic ciders.\r\n\r\nA different way to enjoy cider. cider lovers will find this to be a much more refreshing drink.

We knew what we wanted to drink, but we needed some help actually brewing it. So we enlisted our first brewer, took over some warehouse space on the Boston waterfront, and began introducing fresh, local craft beer to Boston drinkers. We tried to do it in a way that captured the spirit of fun that had brought us to beer in the first place. From that warehouse, surrounded by fish companies on the docks of South Boston (neighboring what is now the Seaport District), we couldn\u2019t imagine that craft brewing would become what it has today.  \r\n\r\nWe still remember our days on the other side of the bar, and have spent as much time spreading the joy of beer drinking as we have focusing on recipes, ingredients, and brewing equipment. Hopefully our sense of gratitude is reflected in both the quality of the beer and the spirit of fun and enjoyment surrounding our beer and breweries.
