This majestic white oak stands in the middle of where the road would have gone, if not for this tree\u2019s historical significance.  If you look closely at the trunk of this old oak, you will notice the mark of an equal armed cross carved into its bark. The cross was carved sometime between 1775 and 1776 when Spanish Lt. Colonel Juan Batista de Anza led more than 240 men, women and children on an overland journey from the frontier New Spain to settle in Alta California. During that 1,200 mile journey, the very thirsty Colonel carved the cross to signify the perfect location for a brewery\u2026well, that\u2019s our story at Barrelhouse and we can\u2019t exactly prove it, but we\u2019re sticking to it!
