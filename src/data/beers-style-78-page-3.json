It is one of Munich's oldest beer halls. It was originally founded as the brewery to the old Royal Residence, which at that time was situated just around the corner from where the beer hall stands today. The beer quickly became world famous thanks to the first brewer, Heimeran Pongratz, and the famous \"Bavarian Beer Purity Law\" of 1516 that stated that only natural ingredients could be used in the brewing process. In fact, the beer became so famous that it once saved the city from annihilation. When King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden invaded Bavaria during the Thirty Years' War in 1632, he threatened to sack and burn the entire city of Munich. He agreed to leave the city in peace if the citizens surrendered some hostages, and 600,000 barrels of Hofbr\u00e4uhaus beer.","website":"http:\/\/www.hofbraeuhaus.de\/","established":"1589","mailingListUrl":"info@hofbrauhaus.us","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/4rlPFf\/upload_I2Et6Q-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/4rlPFf\/upload_I2Et6Q-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/4rlPFf\/upload_I2Et6Q-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/4rlPFf\/upload_I2Et6Q-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/4rlPFf\/upload_I2Et6Q-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2016-06-17 14:36:33","locations":[{"id":"BzJnwS","name":"Hofbr\u00e4uhaus M\u00fcnchen","streetAddress":"Am Platzl 9","locality":"M\u00fcnchen","region":"Bayern","phone":"49-(0)89-\/-92105-0","website":"http:\/\/www.hofbraeuhaus.de\/","hoursOfOperation":"Daily 9:00am -

While visiting relatives in Bavaria, Germany and having traveled numerous times to the great brewing countries of the UK and Europe, Mark came to this simple conclusion, \u201cAmerican beers are boring and just are not very satisfying\u201d. In Europe and the UK every area had its own local brewery and the beer was fresh and had flavor and a lot of body. So his quest to bring premium fresh flavorful beers to his town was born.\r\n\r\nWorking as an apprentice with some of the original craft brewers in California, it gave him an a working knowledge and appreciation as well as insight into the business of craft beer. Heritage Brewing was co-founded by Mark in 1989 and was Orange County\u2019s first micro brewery (brewpub) and they also became known as the premier live blues venue in the OC. Several years later Mark founded his production facility in Riverside County and produced products under Heritage\u2019s label as well as producing white label products for restaurants such as Claim Jumper, Wahoo\u2019s, BJ\u2019s Pizza, etc. In addition, Mark's facility produced and packaged many bottled products that have sold in all major retailers throughout So Cal.\r\n\r\nMark has brewed on various systems from 7bbl to 110 bbl, as well as installations and recipe formulations for many local brewpubs. Mark has received numerous awards from local beer festivals, state fairs, national and international beer festivals. Having received over 20 awards ranging from best of show, blue ribbons, bronze, silver and gold, with a Gold medal at the Great American Beer Festival, you can rest assured that the philosophy surrounding Mark, is a quality product every time. Mark's Nut Brown Ale was also celebrated in Michael Jacksons world pocket guide to beer as \u201cworld class\u201d .","website":"http:\/\/www.legacybrewingco.com","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QXkarn\/upload_g7ZFSX-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QXkarn\/upload_g7ZFSX-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QXkarn\/upload_g7ZFSX-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QXkarn\/upload_g7ZFSX-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QXkarn\/upload_g7ZFSX-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-16 21:36:58","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:52:30","locations":[{"id":"HIzVEo","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"363 Airport Road","locality":"Oceanside","region":"California","postalCode":"92058","phone":"(760) 705-3221","website":"http:\/\/www.legacybrewingco.com","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Sun: 11:00 am - 11:00 pm","latitude":33.2153901,"longitude":-117.3507698,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-16 21:37:30","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"JbA8ks","name":"Tap and Kitchen","streetAddress":"7060 Miramar Road, Ste 100","locality":"San Diego","region":"California","postalCode":"92121","phone":"858-695-9953","website":"http:\/\/legacybrewingtapandkitchen.com","latitude":32.8793454,"longitude":-117.1637115,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-04-24 07:02:09","updateDate":"2016-05-12 20:33:39","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"wxXMiI","name":"Jacobsen Dark Lager","nameDisplay":"Jacobsen Dark Lager (2000)","description":"Original Dark Lager is brewed according to J.C.

All the equipment was removed and brought back to Lakewood, New York and set up at its new 10,000 square foot home, The Southern Tier Brewing Company. The Brewery began operations in February 2004 distributing regionally. By 2005 sales covered the majority of the New York State and the eastern half of Pennsylvania. In the beginning their two Flagship brands were a Pilsner and Mild Ale. Oh yeah they also brewed IPA! As it turned out the flagships were a flop and the IPA was a huge success. They next launched a line of seasonal beers which have gained great success. Since the beginning, Southern Tier has experienced steady growth, currently distributing to over 25% of the United States. Multiple expansions have been made to keep up with demand and the brewery continues to be innovative by producing new products.

By the end of the 19th-Century the brewery would be one of the largest in the United States. The brewery closed its doors when Prohibition began in 1919. The brand was revived in 1981 as one of the pioneer craft beers of todays craft beer movement, with the introduction of a series of Christian Moerlein beers by the Hudepohl Brewing Company. In 1984, Christian Moerlein Lager was the first American beer ever certified by the German government to pass the German Beer Purity Law (Reinheitsgebot). After a series of sales that took the business and brewing out of the region, the company was relocated once again to Cincinnati in 2004 by Gregory Hardman, its current local owner. With the goal of returning Cincinnati's grand brewing traditions, Hardman led the effort to build a world-class Moerlein Lager House brewery\/gastropub on the banks of the Ohio River which opened in 2012 in Cincinnati's Smale Riverfront Park next to Great American Ballpark, home of the Cincinnati Reds. A spectacular craft brewing facility and Malt House Taproom opened in 2013 in the historic Over-the-Rhine brewery district, just blocks from its original 19th century home. The brewery offers tours and has a taproom in an original 1860's malt house complete with historic underground lagering cellars. The brewery is the first American craft brewer to rescue a City's heritage beer brands and owns Hudepohl-Schoenling Brewing Co. including the brands of Hudepohl, Hudy Delight, Hudy 14-K, Burger and Little Kings Cream Ale brands.","website":"http:\/\/www.christianmoerlein.com\/","established":"1853","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Em1uno\/upload_DkG1sa-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Em1uno\/upload_DkG1sa-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Em1uno\/upload_DkG1sa-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Em1uno\/upload_DkG1sa-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Em1uno\/upload_DkG1sa-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:50","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:11:17","locations":[{"id":"qo6LCf","name":"Main Brewery, General Offices and Taproom","streetAddress":"1621 Moore St.","locality":"Cincinnati","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45202","phone":"513-827-6025","website":"http:\/\/www.christianmoerlein.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Wed:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\nThu:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\nFri:  4:00pm - 12:00am\nSat:  12:00pm - 12:00am\nSun:  12:00pm - 7:00pm\n\n","latitude":39.1137948,"longitude":-84.5150108,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1853","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:50","updateDate":"2014-12-15 02:45:48","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"X0HMO8","name":"Christian Moerlein Lager House","streetAddress":"115 Joe Nuxhall Way","locality":"Cincinnati","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45202","phone":"513-421-2337","website":"http:\/\/www.moerleinlagerhouse.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  1:00pm - 8:00pm, 11:00am - 11:00pm\nTue:  1:00pm - 8:00pm, 11:00am - 11:00pm\nWed:  1:00pm - 8:00pm, 11:00am - 11:00pm\nThu:  1:00pm - 8:00pm, 11:00am - 11:00pm\nFri:  11:00am - 10:00pm, 11:00am - 1:00am\nSat:  11:00am - 10:00pm, 11:00am - 11:00am\nSun:  12:00pm - 6:00pm, 11:00am - 10:00pm\n\n","latitude":39.0963619,"longitude":-84.5087017,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"restaurant","locationTypeDisplay":"Restaurant\/Ale House","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-02 18:10:31","updateDate":"2014-12-15 02:46:10","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"VbRWCk","name":"Lager Longfin","nameDisplay":"Lager Longfin","description":"When the coastal water near San Diego begin to warm up each year, anglers anticipate the return of the albacore Tuna, know locally as Longfin.

We currently distribute five of our favorite beers, Yellowtail Pale Ale,  Calico Amber Ale , Big Eye I.P.A., Black Marlin Porter and Wahoo Wheat Beer to a thirsty San Diego.  Come to our brewery and we will gladly give you a tour and allow you to sample our newest selection of beers. Currently our beer is available in twelve ounce bottles to 15.5 gallon kegs. We also offer half gallon and gallon glass jugs to go. Kegs are available for rent to the public with a minimum deposit.  The name for our brewery comes from the point where Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo first set foot in California. Located on the Point Loma Peninsula, Ballast Point is considered the gateway to San Diego Harbor.

The common thread that binds all of Penn\u2019s beers together, however, is exceptional quality and craftsmanship.  We produce all of our brews in the classic, old-world way, without taking any shortcuts. We use copper kettles for optimal heat control. We employ double-decoction grain mashing to release fuller flavor in our lagers.  And we lager all of our beers in horizontal tanks for a cleaner, crisper finish. \r\n\r\nPenn Brewery is housed in the mid-nineteenth century landmark E&O Brewery building and is one of only a handful of working breweries with original beer caves still on premise.

Rogue closed its Ashland operation in 1997, after the great flood destroyed the place. In 1991, the 15bbl system, named Howard after John Maier's former boss, from the Newport brewpub was transferred across the bay to the current brewery and upgraded to a 30bbl system. In 1998 Rogue bought a 50bbl brewsystem, named Kobe. Kobe is the only brewsystem in use. Tours: We offer brewery tours every day at 3 pm (followed by a distillery tour at 4pm).

Certain renditions of this beer style have  a perceivable level of hop flavor (note: hop flavor does not imply hop bitterness) and character but it is essentially balanced with malt character to retain its style identity. Malt character is sometimes bread-like yet always reminiscent of freshly and very lightly toasted malted barley. There should not be any caramel character. Color is light straw to golden. Fruity esters and diacetyl should not be perceived.
