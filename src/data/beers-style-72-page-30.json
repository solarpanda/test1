Since then, the Central PA natives have been handcrafting world-class beers that blend traditional brewing techniques with the innovation and eclecticism of the American craft brewing movement. Today, the Hershey, PA-based brewery produces six year-round beers (Hopback Amber Ale, Troegenator Double Bock, JavaHead Stout, Tr\u00f6egs Pale Ale, DreamWeaver Wheat, and Perpetual IPA); four seasonal releases as part of the Hop Cycle series (Cultivator Helles Bock, Sunshine Pils, Hop Knife Harvest Ale, and Blizzard of Hops Winter IPA); and two limited beers (Nugget Nectar and Mad Elf Ale). \r\n\r\nIn addition to these beers, Tr\u00f6egs produces a variety of experimental, small batch beers as part of its Scratch Beer Series. These beers are available exclusively at the brewery and most are draft-only limited releases, although some popular Scratch Beers (Fresh Hop Ale, Fest Lager, etc.) are bottled for release through the General Store at the brewery. \r\n\r\nIn late 2013, Tr\u00f6egs introduced a special line of cork & cage bottle releases. The first, LaGrave, is available year-round. Master of Pumpkins was also released in 2013 and will continue with availability in the fall. Other beers such as Jovial have since followed suit. The addition of a canning line not only offers the brewery more flexibility in the way it presents its beers, but also allows Tr\u00f6egs to provide customers with more packaging options. To date, Tr\u00f6egs has released Perpetual IPA and Sunshine Pils in 12-ounce cans and Troegenator in 16-ounce cans. Plans to release other seasonal and limited beers in cans are currently in the works. \r\n\r\nThe Splinter Series is an extremely limited line of barrel-aged beers packaged in cork & cage bottles. While only a handful of these beers have been produced, Tr\u00f6egs plans to expand this series with the inclusion of Nebulous (barrel-aged LaGrave with Brett), bourbon barrel-aged Troegenator, and others. \r\n\r\nTr\u00f6egs currently distributes its beers throughout Delaware, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Washington D.C. In addition, Tr\u00f6egs plans to expand into other New England markets in 2015.\r\n\r\nOur state-of-the-art facility gives visitors a glimpse into the workings of a full production brewery by offering both guided tasting and self-guided tours. Our Tasting Room provides ample seating with views of the brewhouse, where you can sit back and enjoy one of our six year-round beers as well as a variety of seasonal and small-batch experimental brews. \r\n\r\nOur Snack Bar reflects our constant desire to explore, discover and share by focusing on fresh, simple fare that is locally sourced and house-made. With that in mind, we feature a seasonally rotating menu with daily chef\u2019s specials.\r\n\r\nwww.troegs.com","website":"http:\/\/www.troegs.com\/","established":"1997","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/www.troegs.com\/about_us\/newsletter.aspx","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_d9lSk3-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_d9lSk3-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_d9lSk3-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_d9lSk3-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_d9lSk3-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:01:05","locations":[{"id":"C6iHOv","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"200 E Hersheypark Dr","locality":"Hershey","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"17033","phone":"717-232-1297","website":"http:\/\/www.troegs.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sun:  11:00am - 9:00pm\nThu:  11:00am - 10:00pm\nFri:  11:00am - 10:00pm\nSat:  11:00am - 10:00pm\n\nGeneral Store Hours\r\n------------------------------\r\nSunday: 11am to 5pm\r\nMonday - Saturday: 11am to 8pm","latitude":40.2972852,"longitude":-76.6428527,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1997","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2015-04-24 16:00:33","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"ZVY3LL","name":"S\u00e9ance","nameDisplay":"S\u00e9ance","description":"S\u00e9ance is a dark, complexly concocted Saison, rich with earthy hues and flavors.

Our beers are created with over 99% local Colorado ingredients. We ferment and age our beers in vintage oak barrels with a mixed culture of saccharomyces, brettanomyces and lactic acid bacteria. Time is one of the most important elements to us, as the barrel aging process creates flavors that are impossible to create any other way.  Our beers are unfiltered and 100% bottle conditioned.","website":"http:\/\/www.caseybrewing.com","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/J6OPsX\/upload_UrpdNM-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/J6OPsX\/upload_UrpdNM-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/J6OPsX\/upload_UrpdNM-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/J6OPsX\/upload_UrpdNM-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/J6OPsX\/upload_UrpdNM-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-01-04 02:32:50","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:03:03","locations":[{"id":"SlryVk","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"3421 Grand Avenue","locality":"Glenwood Springs","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"81601","phone":"(970) 230-9691","hoursOfOperation":"Since the majority of our beers are still aging, our brewery opening times will be extremely limited and sporadic.

A brown dubbel with earthy undertones named Abbey and a remarkably well-balanced amber he named Fat Tire. To say the rest was history would be to overlook his wife's involvement.

Eric and Tim quickly realized that this is an excercise in futility, but along the way, their steadfast persistence and the quest to make a truly satisfying beer has resulted in countless hours of research and experimentation. While the small 5 gallon batches allowed for plenty of great experience, they yearned for more creative control.\r\n\r\nThe brewers decided it was time for a more professional three vessel system, giving them complete control over the brewing process. The 1\/2 barrel system gave the brewers a solid platform to refine and perfect a lineup of beers for the most discerning pallet. This led to the creation of several great recipes, and a roster of clean crisp beers.

Let\u2019s start a craft beer brewery!\u201d  That Clarity in Thinking, led to the successful launch of Lucid Brewing.\r\n\r\nIn June of 2011, with a year of planning already completed, they realized jumping headfirst into the brewery was the only way they could make their dream a reality.  They quit their day jobs.  \r\n\r\nWith that leap of faith \u2013 and a ton of support from many friends and family \u2013 they started building their brewery from the ground up.  Through the sweltering heat of the 2011 summer, many friends labored side by side with Jon and Eric.  They did it all, start to finish, from digging trenches to assembling the last tank.  So of course they needed a refreshing and light drink to quench their thirst while they toiled away.  They found just the right recipe and brewed their first beer \u2013 AIR.  A beer made to get the job done.  Its slight citrus aroma and flavor, lower ABV and crisp dry finish made this their favorite \u201cgo to\u201d beer.  \r\n\r\nBy October the brewery was complete and cooking.  And in the spirit of the season, Eric and Jon gave thanks to the Brew gods when they made their first deliveries to their first three customers the week of Thanksgiving\u2026 in Jon\u2019s car.  Lucid was on its way!\r\n\r\nAlways keeping an eye on the demand for high quality while quickly catching the craft beer lover\u2019s attention, Lucid assembled a team of dedicated employees and introduced brews to quench their customers\u2019 demands.   AIR, DYNO, FOTO and DUO, along with seasonal and small-batch brews, are quickly becoming Minnesota favorites at local bars and restaurants.  \r\n\r\nGreat success has followed them after throwing away the daily grind for the daily brew.","website":"http:\/\/www.lucidbrewing.com\/","established":"2011","mailingListUrl":"www.LucidBrewing.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0cACKo\/upload_KCE6lg-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0cACKo\/upload_KCE6lg-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0cACKo\/upload_KCE6lg-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0cACKo\/upload_KCE6lg-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0cACKo\/upload_KCE6lg-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:01","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:22:32","locations":[{"id":"1xeovq","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"6020 Culligan Way","locality":"Minnetonka","region":"Minnesota","postalCode":"55345","phone":"612-810-9324","website":"http:\/\/lucidbrewing.wordpress.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Thu - Fri: 5:00 pm - 8:00 pm\r\nSat: 12:00 pm - 5:00 pm","latitude":44.895218,"longitude":-93.449725,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2009","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:01","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"kRFryO","name":"Silver Lining Saison","nameDisplay":"Silver Lining Saison","description":"A light, thirst-quenching saison with a twangy finish.","abv":"6.5","styleId":72,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-10-24 19:24:39","updateDate":"2014-10-24 19:24:39","style":{"id":72,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"French & Belgian-Style Saison","shortName":"Saison","description":"Beers in this category are golden to deep amber in color.

There is absolute no doubt that we run the safest brewing enterprise in the country as our premises used to be an air-raid shelter. Our premises have also been used for storing bibles, hence reigns an atmosphere of divine tranquillity only otherwise found in Belgian monasteries. Well...\r\n \r\nFounders of the brewery are the two friends and dedicated home brewers Mr. Morten Valentin Lundsbak and Mr. Jacob Storm, who since the opening of the brewery have achieved diplomas of their skills as they have become Diploma Brewers at the Scandinavian School of Brewing.\r\n \r\nIt is our ambition to cater to all beer lovers - every time, which is why we only use pure ingredients during the brewing process. We make no shortcuts by using artificial additives to speed or help the processes. Furthermore, we have deliberately chosen neither to pasteurize nor filter our beer as we would like to preserve the best possible flavours and aromas.\r\n \r\nWe allow the beer to mature completely in the bottle before releasing it to the market. This process implies that a natural sediment may remain in the bottle. This sediment can easily be consumed, but if an aesthetic beer experience is desired, pour the beer gently into the glass without the sediment. And preferably use a high pour to get the full and frothy head as well as to release all the pleasant aromas from this well-brewed beer from Amager Bryghus.","website":"http:\/\/www.amagerbryghus.dk\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/LOKnrY\/upload_4EzywV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/LOKnrY\/upload_4EzywV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/LOKnrY\/upload_4EzywV-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/LOKnrY\/upload_4EzywV-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/LOKnrY\/upload_4EzywV-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-03-06 18:54:21","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:28:23","locations":[{"id":"8tHhXL","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Fugleb\u00e6kvej 2 C","region":"Kastrup","postalCode":"2770","phone":"+45 32 50 62 00 \u200e","website":"http:\/\/www.amagerbryghus.dk\/","latitude":55.624252,"longitude":12.595661,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DK","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-03-06 18:55:10","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"DK","name":"DENMARK","displayName":"Denmark","isoThree":"DNK","numberCode":208,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"QpZN5a","name":"Siren's Lure","nameDisplay":"Siren's Lure","abv":"7.2","styleId":72,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-07-04 11:22:13","updateDate":"2016-07-04 11:22:13","style":{"id":72,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"French & Belgian-Style Saison","shortName":"Saison","description":"Beers in this category are golden to deep amber in color.

There may be quite a variety of characters within this style. Generally: They are light to medium in body. Malt aroma is low to medium-low. Esters are medium to high in  aroma, while, complex alcohols, herbs, spices, low Brettanomyces character and even clove and smoke-like phenolics may or may not be evident in the overall balanced beer. Hop aroma and flavor may be at low to medium levels. Malt flavor is low but provides foundation for the overall balance. Hop bitterness is moderate to moderately assertive. Herb and\/or spice flavors, including black pepper-like notes, may or may not be evident. Fruitiness from fermentation is generally in character. A balanced small amount of sour or acidic flavors is acceptable when in balance with other components. Earthy, cellar-like, musty aromas are okay. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Chill or slight yeast haze is okay. Often bottle conditioned with some yeast character and high carbonation. French & Belgian-Style Saison may have Brettanomyces characters that are slightly acidity, fruity, horsey, goaty and\/or leather-like.","ibuMin":"20","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"4.5","abvMax":"8.5","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"14","ogMin":"1.055","fgMin":"1.004","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:34:55"},"breweries":[{"id":"OCwm38","name":"Aslin Beer Co.","nameShortDisplay":"Aslin Beer Co.","description":"Since the inception of Aslin Beer Company, Andrew, Kai, & Richard wanted to create a company that they all would want to work for.
