It was developed by Gar and Lara Truppelli and Timon Malloy in 1997 after the Chalet had sat vacant for 17 years. To remodel and restore this historic building to its former glory so it could be a landmark to be enjoyed by future generations as well as to create a space for their restaurateurs\u2019 dreams, they brought Heller Manus Architects onboard to help make their dreams a reality.\r\n\r\nToday thousands of guests enjoy the Modern American Cuisine menu and hand crafted ales. The Beach Chalet offers a full bar, abundant free parking and a breathtaking ocean view. Bay Area residents and visitors find the Beach Chalet to be a wonderful San Francisco experience while visiting Golden Gate Park and Ocean Beach.

Out technical background in Microbiology, Chemistry, and Automation, made up the perfect storm needed to produce quality beer with a higher level of consistency and with improved shelf stability. Our passion for beer and diversity of tastes allowed us to craft carefully refined recipes that we know will delight you.\r\n\r\nWe chose Fountain Square because of the community. Since we will be the first to admit our creativity and talents exist on a side of the brain that has little capability to draw, we have this admiration and attraction to those whose talents reside in the arts. We have connected to this community over the past year and look forward to being a vehicle for expressing its artistic nature. Fountain Square is a community of hard working, creative, fun loving, and genuine people. They are probably the most helpful people we've ever met. We are truly honored to be a part of the community and will strive to be worthy ambassadors and stewards.","website":"http:\/\/www.fountainsquarebrewery.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/f78xIY\/upload_jbPLiV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/f78xIY\/upload_jbPLiV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/f78xIY\/upload_jbPLiV-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/f78xIY\/upload_jbPLiV-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/f78xIY\/upload_jbPLiV-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-04-16 19:49:52","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:28:59","locations":[{"id":"N1ToDA","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1301 Barth Ave.","locality":"Indianapolis","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"46203","phone":"317.493.1410","hoursOfOperation":"Thursday - 4pm to 9pm\r\nFriday - 4pm to 10pm\r\nSaturday - 2pm to 10pm\r\nSunday - Noon - 6pm","latitude":39.749645,"longitude":-86.140794,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-04-16 19:54:28","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
