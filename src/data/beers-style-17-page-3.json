For us, this is a passion, not a job. We believe that this comes through in the beers we make. Our beers have soul.\r\n\r\nWe brew several different beers; some are year round, some are seasonal and a few are single batch brews. They are available in bars, restaurants, grocery stores, liquor stores and warehouse stores throughout Texas and Louisiana.\r\n\r\nOur first keg of beer was shipped on June 9, 1994. Founded by Brock Wagner and Kevin Bartol, we chose Houston because, other than living here, this was the largest city in the country that did not have a microbrewery. Brock was a longtime homebrewer and had considered opening a brewery as far back as college, although that was quickly dismissed as a silly idea. Seven years after graduating, Brock revisited the idea, enlisted Kevin's help and the brewery was off and running. Kevin has since left the business after a bitter battle. (Just kidding - but don't you wish people wrote that when it was the truth?).\r\n\r\nPlease visit us if you are in Houston.

Each of the beers have been formulated from carefully selected malted barley, treated water, multiple varieties of hops, and a specific yeast strain to produce the flavor, mouth-feel, alcohol content, aroma and bitterness, as well as the complex flavor profile according to the time and temperature recipe intended by the brewer. In addition to the attention to detail required for consistent and repeatable brews the brewmaster and support personnel follow a disciplined regiment of cleaning manually, and automatically with Clean-In-Place Systems (CIP) to exclude off-flavors, contaminants, and other undesirables in our beers. Every beer we serve has been naturally processed without the assistance of filtration which is why we are intensely focused on the highest quality ingredients, temperature controls, and finish aging to serve a quality product that we hope you enjoy as much as we do.","website":"http:\/\/www.hogsheadbrewery.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/otXCdW\/upload_pJQGom-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/otXCdW\/upload_pJQGom-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/otXCdW\/upload_pJQGom-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/otXCdW\/upload_pJQGom-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/otXCdW\/upload_pJQGom-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-10-16 14:20:59","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:00:18","locations":[{"id":"B43raw","name":"Hogshead Brewery and Tap Room","streetAddress":"4460 W 29th Ave","locality":"Denver","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"80212","phone":"303-495-3105","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\nTue:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\nWed:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\nThu:  12:00pm - 10:00pm\nFri:  12:00pm - 10:00pm\nSat:  12:00pm - 10:00pm\nSun:  12:00pm - 10:00pm\n\n","latitude":39.7581892,"longitude":-105.045106,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-10-16 14:31:27","updateDate":"2014-10-16 14:31:27","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"qiogur","name":"Winter Warlock","nameDisplay":"Winter Warlock","description":"Available in December Winter Warlock was made in the tradition of some of England's great barley-wine ales. Our beer is made with delicious base malt and sugar. We boiled for over two hours to caramelize some of the sugars. The final product is as smooth as freshly resurfaced ice with a subtle hop character. This beer pairs nicely with calamari, ham and quail. Enjoy this beer with someone special on a cold winter's night. Get cozy by a roaring fire, and take time to reflect on how each beer is as unique as a snowflake.","abv":"10.1","ibu":"46","glasswareId":5,"srmId":7,"availableId":4,"styleId":17,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/qiogur\/upload_vwvnzC-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/qiogur\/upload_vwvnzC-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/qiogur\/upload_vwvnzC-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","originalGravity":"1.1","createDate":"2014-05-23 13:49:59","updateDate":"2015-12-17 14:05:38","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"srm":{"id":7,"name":"7","hex":"F39C00"},"available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":17,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"British-Style Barley Wine Ale","shortName":"British Barleywine","description":"British-style barley wines range from tawny copper to dark brown in color and have a full body and high residual malty sweetness.

In search of a calmer life and an even better beer, Jeff turned his passion for brewing into a career. After a temporary stint at Northern Brewer and a job as an assistant brewer at Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery, Flat Earth opened in Saint Paul and set out to create beers not normally found in the upper Midwest. Flat Earth's distinctive brews are often inspired by the couple's travels and time spent in conversation with family and friends. The company's brewing on the edge philosophy is reflected in its stylish interpretation of traditional brewing assumptions. Today, Flat Earth Brewing produces a variety of artisan ales and lagers every month. As the beers roll out of the brewery, you're sure to see a theme develop around their names  a hint of conspiracy, perhaps. The names are meant to get people thinking and talking. Whether you enjoy Flat Earth beers at home or out with friends, there are no secrets when it comes to good beer.","website":"http:\/\/flatearthbrewing.com\/","established":"2007","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/AulWoF\/upload_iM4ovC-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/AulWoF\/upload_iM4ovC-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/AulWoF\/upload_iM4ovC-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/AulWoF\/upload_iM4ovC-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/AulWoF\/upload_iM4ovC-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:45:56","locations":[{"id":"6gpvgZ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2035 Benson Avenue","locality":"St. Paul","region":"Minnesota","postalCode":"55116","website":"http:\/\/flatearthbrewing.com\/","latitude":44.9084187,"longitude":-93.1538067,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"LNr16q","name":"Hamm's Building","streetAddress":"688 Minnehaha Avenue East","locality":"Saint Paul","region":"Minnesota","postalCode":"55106","phone":"(651) 698-1945","website":"http:\/\/www.flatearthbrewing.com","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Sat: 12:00 pm - 6:30 pm","latitude":44.9629992,"longitude":-93.0716823,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-05-23 13:42:34","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"dQc9zM","name":"X 2.1 Barley Wine","nameDisplay":"X 2.1 Barley Wine","abv":"9.5","ibu":"60","styleId":17,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-12-16 21:04:37","updateDate":"2015-03-10 19:55:11","style":{"id":17,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"British-Style Barley Wine Ale","shortName":"British Barleywine","description":"British-style barley wines range from tawny copper to dark brown in color and have a full body and high residual malty sweetness.
