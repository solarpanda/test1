The original Downtown location opened in November 1994 and expanded with the addition of a pool hall in 1996. The wild success of the first Great Dane led to the decision to open more pubs in the Madison area.\r\n\r\nThe Fitchburg Great Dane began operations in 2002 and the Hilldale pub followed in 2006. In 2009, the Hilldale pub expanded its brewery and opened a 4,000 square foot pool hall. Additionally, in May of 2009, the first Great Dane outside of the Madison area debuted in Wausau, Wisconsin. The Wausau Great Dane added a 100 seat beer garden and outdoor bar in the spring of 2011.

Rogue's first brewpub was located in Ashland, Oregon and was a 10bbl brewsystem. Rogue opened a second brewpub, 15bbl brewsystem, in May 1989 located in Newport, Oregon. Rogue closed its Ashland operation in 1997, after the great flood destroyed the place. In 1991, the 15bbl system, named Howard after John Maier's former boss, from the Newport brewpub was transferred across the bay to the current brewery and upgraded to a 30bbl system. In 1998 Rogue bought a 50bbl brewsystem, named Kobe. Kobe is the only brewsystem in use. Tours: We offer brewery tours every day at 3 pm (followed by a distillery tour at 4pm). Go up to the bar inside the brewery (Brewers on the Bay) and check in with the bartender and the tour will commence. Please call ahead if you have a large group and or to verify the tour time...Brewer's on the Bay phone is 541-867-3664.

In the beginning we had only one ale, the Guldenberg, named after the Guldenberg Abbey in Wevelgem, where beer was brewed in the past. With a history in the beer world (since 1930 the Bacelle - Noffels family was active in beer commerce and as a lemonade producer), Nino had started experimenting with brewing ale in 1981. After an education as brewer at the CTL in Ghent in the mid eighties, he kept experimenting and in the nineties he thought his time had come (and his ale was good enough) to commercialize his ale. After a decent study of the possibilities to start his own brewery, he decided to start with brewing in a existing brewery. The good thing about this formula is that it\u2019s possible to brew profitable without big investments. The Deca brewery is Woesten was chosen to do this and in the first year 9000 litres of Guldenberg were brewed.","website":"http:\/\/deranke.be\/","established":"1994","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/C7C49d\/upload_erf4Bf-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/C7C49d\/upload_erf4Bf-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/C7C49d\/upload_erf4Bf-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/C7C49d\/upload_erf4Bf-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/C7C49d\/upload_erf4Bf-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:41:47","locations":[{"id":"qBSM79","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Brugsstraat 43","locality":"Wevelgem","region":"West-Vlaanderen","phone":"32-056-41-82-41","website":"http:\/\/deranke.be\/","latitude":50.8104527,"longitude":3.1857196,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"BE","yearOpened":"1994","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"BE","name":"BELGIUM","displayName":"Belgium","isoThree":"BEL","numberCode":56,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"laJu2o","name":"XXXB","nameDisplay":"XXXB","abv":"4.8","glasswareId":5,"availableId":1,"styleId":5,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-09-15 07:54:20","updateDate":"2015-09-16 20:06:43","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":5,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Extra Special Bitter","shortName":"ESB","description":"Extra special bitter possesses medium to strong hop aroma, flavor, and bitterness.

And the idea of a craft brewery in Cleveland caught on fast, as curious patrons hurried in for a pint crafted in the styles of old and drawn from the taps of the beautiful Victorian era bar. The company's commitment to sustainable business practices greatly contributed to its early popularity and success.

Rogue's first brewpub was located in Ashland, Oregon and was a 10bbl brewsystem. Rogue opened a second brewpub, 15bbl brewsystem, in May 1989 located in Newport, Oregon. Rogue closed its Ashland operation in 1997, after the great flood destroyed the place. In 1991, the 15bbl system, named Howard after John Maier's former boss, from the Newport brewpub was transferred across the bay to the current brewery and upgraded to a 30bbl system. In 1998 Rogue bought a 50bbl brewsystem, named Kobe. Kobe is the only brewsystem in use. Tours: We offer brewery tours every day at 3 pm (followed by a distillery tour at 4pm). Go up to the bar inside the brewery (Brewers on the Bay) and check in with the bartender and the tour will commence. Please call ahead if you have a large group and or to verify the tour time...Brewer's on the Bay phone is 541-867-3664.
