Kol\u2019 Beer is our award winning Kolsch style beer and has quickly become a local favorite and the go to beer for many a Texan. A subtle malt character, balanced with the right amount of hops. Clean, crisp and refreshing. \r\nTPA is the state\u2019s first Texas-style IPA, a sessionable and easy drinking, everyday IPA. Hoppy, clean and balanced. \r\nThe Luckenbock is our traditional German style bock beer Garnet in color, big in flavor. Malty, earthy and crisp. \r\nWe added two new beers this spring, Six-String Saison and Crossroads Coffee Stout. Six String is our non traditional take on the Franco- Belgian style farmhouse ale. Complex flavors. Spicy, citric and funky. The Cross Roads is a coffee stout with a unique blend of roasted barley, chocolate malt and oats. Infused with fresh roasted Brazilian micro lot coffee. Big, malty, roasted flavor. \r\nThe latest addition to the line up is our Evel Ale. A Blonde All American Ale.
