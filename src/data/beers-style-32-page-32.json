Using barley, oats, wheat, and rye, we\u2019ve brought the mood of fall to life with vibrant and flavorful passion.\r\n\r\nFarming is about precision, timing and care. At Ommegang we place the same emphasis a farmer has for his crops into the creation of our beers. Scythe and Sickle is a testament to the craft and care of farming, from which our farmstead-brewed beers benefit greatly.\r\n\r\nBrewed with balance in mind, Scythe & Sickle reveals a smooth and creamy mouthfeel with light toastiness and gentle sweetness. Bright amber in color from the mixed malts, the beer is balanced with delicate hopping to counter rather than overpower the malt profile.","abv":"5.8","availableId":3,"styleId":32,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/EM0COj\/upload_gFwLCw-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/EM0COj\/upload_gFwLCw-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/EM0COj\/upload_gFwLCw-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-02-26 12:27:01","updateDate":"2015-12-17 01:39:06","available":{"id":3,"name":"Not Available","description":"Beer is not available."},"style":{"id":32,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Amber\/Red Ale","shortName":"Amber","description":"American amber\/red ales range from light copper to light brown in color.

From a funky storefront on the famous Pacific Coast Highway the duo ran the \u201cPizza Port\u201d with a classic menu of pizza and chicken wings to which they added their own \u201cSan Diego\u201d twist.  The Original Pizza Port in Solana Beach\r\n\r\nThe parking was limited and the building crowded with simple hand-built picnic tables and a hodge-podge d\u00e9cor of surf-related paraphernalia almost at odds with the sophisticated flavors of the food. But word spread quickly and it wasn\u2019t long before Pizza Port was a local favorite. \r\n\r\nEarly on Vince took advantage of free space in the restaurant\u2019s storage area to dabble with home brewing. The hobby took off and he was eventually brewing more than could reasonably be consumed at home. So at the urging of friends and fans, the Vince and Gina decided to go into the brewpub business. Pizza Port offered its first craft-brewed beers to patrons in 1992. \r\n\r\nEmbracing the same \u201cflavor-driven\u201d principles that had made the pizza menu so popular, Pizza Port quickly gained a reputation in San Diego\u2019s nascent craft beer scene. In 1997 the company opened a second location a few miles north of Solana Beach in Carlsbad, and a third in 2003 in San Clemente. The same year San Clemente opened (as well as the year after), the original location in Solana Beach won Great American Beer Festival \u201cSmall Brewpub of the Year\u201d. \r\n\r\nThe Pizza Port family\u2019s reputation for great foods and craft beer continued to grow, making them landmarks not just for Southern Californians, but for beer lovers from around the world. In 2008 they opened a premium bottle shop with more that 600 craft beers adjacent to the Carlsbad locations, and by the end of the first decade of the 21st century, the Pizza Ports were a brewing dynasty. In 2009 the Pizza Ports won a staggering 9 medals at the 2009 Great American Beer Festival and Pizza Port Carlsbad was named \u201cLarge Brewpub of the Year\u201d.","website":"http:\/\/www.pizzaport.com\/","established":"1987","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QSVVxD\/upload_g7L5OH-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QSVVxD\/upload_g7L5OH-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QSVVxD\/upload_g7L5OH-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QSVVxD\/upload_g7L5OH-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QSVVxD\/upload_g7L5OH-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:10:31","locations":[{"id":"DrFlD0","name":"Carlsbad","streetAddress":"571 Carlsbad Village Dr.","locality":"Carlsbad","region":"California","postalCode":"92008","phone":"760-720-7007","website":"http:\/\/www.pizzaport.com\/locations\/carlsbad\/","latitude":33.1596505,"longitude":-117.3478111,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1997","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"qAyZMR","name":"Solana Beach","streetAddress":"135 N.

Some drive across state lines to acquire the finer choices at festivals and suppliers alike, while others exchange trades with those from other states in search of the locally forbidden. But for those who truly take matters into their own hands, homebrewing beer becomes the purest form of gratification.\r\n\r\nDriven by an extreme passion for both innovation and beer, our Brewmaster took what was once just a dream and decided to create a beer that would not only break state laws but also help change the very same laws that Mississippi has let fall behind. For eight years, he brewed beers of many different styles as a hobby - and with each tasting that he would hold at his home, the crowds grew larger. Eventually, he would be convinced that this beer should be available to those patrons who also appreciate the finer beers of the world.\r\n\r\nLucky Town Brewing Company was founded on this very notion \u2013 to craft beers that break boundaries between the working men and women of Mississippi and their wish for locally produced premium beer. With that mission, Lucas Simmons decided to grant those wishes by sharing his passion for crafting beer in 2011.","website":"http:\/\/www.luckytownbrewing.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/84iCMX\/upload_i51rj9-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/84iCMX\/upload_i51rj9-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/84iCMX\/upload_i51rj9-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/84iCMX\/upload_i51rj9-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/84iCMX\/upload_i51rj9-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-24 10:51:48","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:28:07","locations":[{"id":"qUIYuC","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1710 N Mill St","locality":"Jackson","region":"Mississippi","postalCode":"39202","phone":"(601) 201-0988","website":"http:\/\/www.luckytownbrewing.com","hoursOfOperation":"Fri:  4:00pm - 7:00pm\nSat:  4:00pm - 7:00pm\n\n","latitude":32.319632,"longitude":-90.188048,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-24 10:52:56","updateDate":"2015-02-10 18:15:33","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"eqCbpj","name":"Siren","nameDisplay":"Siren","description":"Its call is intoxicating.

It has been a wonderful and stressful journey so far and we can't wait to see where it takes us next.","website":"http:\/\/wetheadbrewery.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Hr6RhV\/upload_CQgxS6-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Hr6RhV\/upload_CQgxS6-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Hr6RhV\/upload_CQgxS6-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Hr6RhV\/upload_CQgxS6-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Hr6RhV\/upload_CQgxS6-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-23 05:07:23","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:59:27","locations":[{"id":"diJ77A","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"513 A St. NE","locality":"Auburn","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98001","website":"http:\/\/wetheadbrewery.com","latitude":47.3125924,"longitude":-122.2288865,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-23 14:10:55","updateDate":"2016-06-28 13:37:19","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"6uqzFu","name":"SLEDHEAD RED","nameDisplay":"SLEDHEAD RED","description":"An incredibly smooth red ale with moderate bitterness up front, which gives way to a delightful malty finish.
