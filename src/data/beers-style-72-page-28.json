We are huge fans of wine and bourbon barrel aged beers as well so it's only natural for us to have a barrel program. Think bourbon barrels loaded with big chewy imperial stouts, excessively hopped IPAs, fruited sour beers, and funky saisons. This is what we love. This is what we are all about. We hope you are too!\r\n\r\nPlease follow along for the ride as we build San Francisco's next great brewery.\r\n\r\nCheers!","website":"http:\/\/www.cellarmakerbrewing.com","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/kSUGO5\/upload_PjOdy3-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/kSUGO5\/upload_PjOdy3-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/kSUGO5\/upload_PjOdy3-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/kSUGO5\/upload_PjOdy3-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/kSUGO5\/upload_PjOdy3-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-02-24 20:56:28","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:51:35","locations":[{"id":"2MDtOB","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1150 Howard Street","locality":"San Francisco","region":"California","postalCode":"94103","phone":"(415) 863-3940","website":"http:\/\/www.cellarmakerbrewing.com","hoursOfOperation":"Tue:  3:00pm - 11:00pm\r\nWed:  3:00pm - 11:00pm\r\nThu:  3:00pm - 11:00pm\r\nFri:  3:00pm - 11:00pm\r\nSat:  12:00pm - 11:00pm\r\nSun:  1:00pm - 8:00pm","latitude":37.777218,"longitude":-122.410768,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-02-24 21:02:33","updateDate":"2015-08-06 20:11:31","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"506AWw","name":"Saison Gee","nameDisplay":"Saison Gee","glasswareId":8,"availableId":3,"styleId":72,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/506AWw\/upload_wraxLX-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/506AWw\/upload_wraxLX-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/506AWw\/upload_wraxLX-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","servingTemperature":"cool","servingTemperatureDisplay":"Cool - (8-12C\/45-54F)","createDate":"2012-03-07 16:57:39","updateDate":"2015-12-16 15:10:31","glass":{"id":8,"name":"Tulip","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":3,"name":"Not Available","description":"Beer is not available."},"style":{"id":72,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"French & Belgian-Style Saison","shortName":"Saison","description":"Beers in this category are golden to deep amber in color.

Traditionally brewed by Belgian and French farmers to provide refreshment during harvest. I'm guessing that flavour wasn't a main concern back then; the priority was to provide a beverage that was safe to drink, because water usually wasn't. Never the less, over time they developed a beverage chrarissed by beer geeks of the modern world. The alcohol content was low, so the workers could consume enough to keep hydrated and still perform their job: To load the barn with enough barley for next years brewing season. I bet these hardworking, humble farmers never imagined, that centuries later, their style of brewing would inspire brewers from all over the world. As all our beers, this is a very modern, you might say new world, interpretation of this style. Based on the tradition we have used a French Saison yeast, which provides a plethora of funky, earthy, very \"Belgian\" flavours. From there we have upped the ante a fair bit by doubling the amount of malt, and thereby the alcohol, and loaded the kettle with punchy Nelson Sauvin hops. Unlike the original, this is not a beer meant to be drunk by the gallon. Moderation is the key for full enjoyment of all great beers.","abv":"7","ibu":"50","glasswareId":5,"srmId":6,"availableId":1,"styleId":72,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-17 21:46:48","updateDate":"2014-10-14 20:16:38","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"srm":{"id":6,"name":"6","hex":"F8A600"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":72,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"French & Belgian-Style Saison","shortName":"Saison","description":"Beers in this category are golden to deep amber in color.
