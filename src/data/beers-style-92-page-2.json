Today, Chris is an independent brewer \u2013 he owns no facility \u2013 instead brewing and collaborating with other breweries.

These strong beers were made popular in the early 1600s by monks in order to minimize their hunger during fasting periods. While most bocks are dark, Blonde Bock is golden-colored and malty with a rich, creamy head.
