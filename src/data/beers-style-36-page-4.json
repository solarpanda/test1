Although Big Horn Brewing Company is now one of the largest brewpub companies in the country, the goal of our brewers continues to be to produce the freshest, most \u201cdrinkable\u201d beer of the highest quality.","website":"http:\/\/www.cbpotts.com\/","established":"1971","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Thbhby\/upload_rsWfXK-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Thbhby\/upload_rsWfXK-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Thbhby\/upload_rsWfXK-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Thbhby\/upload_rsWfXK-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Thbhby\/upload_rsWfXK-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:42:26","locations":[{"id":"Qg6dpg","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1650 Dell Range Boulevard","locality":"Cheyenne","region":"Wyoming","postalCode":"82001","phone":"307-632-8636","website":"http:\/\/www.cbpotts.com\/","latitude":41.160727,"longitude":-104.801787,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1971","yearClosed":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"nTzKAN","name":"Highlands Ranch","streetAddress":"43 W Centennial Blvd","locality":"Highlands Ranch","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"80126","phone":"720-344-1200","website":"http:\/\/www.cbpotts.com","hoursOfOperation":"Monday -

Always looking to take a good thing too far, we sat down and over a beer (or two) decided that beer itself was a good idea. Of course, not just some easy-drinking institutional prole beer, but stuff like the beers we'd had at great bars. We had frequented places with extensive and varied beer lists. Places with lists 180 items long, all of which we tried twice (not in one night). In short, we wanted beer with flavor. Complexity. Character. Intensity. Not words found in the mass market lexicon.\r\n\r\nSo with a banjo burner, a bunch of industrial kitchen sized pots and as many buckets as we could find, we jumped in feet first. Once a week, every week. We tried to emulate the beers we liked, but soon we were adding a little of this, or some of that and after a while we started having a hard time pegging our beer in a style category. Our first success was a Porter that was mainly porter, slightly stout. We ran it blind with our friends against the porters we liked and people liked it. \"We're on to something\", we thought. Twenty iterations, modifications and tweaks later it is Distorter, and is still our favorite beer.\r\n\r\nThis led to twice a week brewing and handing out bottle after bottle to everyone we knew. Along the way we screwed up a wheat beer by accidentally making it into sort of a copper ale with a few too many hops. And so Red Bud Ale was born. We had some extra noble hops and threw them in the IPA, and with some tinkering we most certainly had a one-of-a-kind IPA. You get the picture. All of this has firmly cemented our \"anything goes\" approach to beer making. Our inability to ever get quite within the style guidelines means we may never win an award, but we're ok with that.\r\n\r\nNow, several years later and with a 90% super-cool\/10% Rube Goldberg 7 bbl version of our banjo burner and kitchen pots, we're befuddling the beer judges and converting the masses. One pint at a time.\r\n\r\nStop in the storefront and try our mainstays, seasonals and small-batch runs. Not to mention our lab beers, where we continue to screw up one thing or another in search of the next great beer.","website":"http:\/\/www.greenbushbrewing.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:19:53","locations":[{"id":"AlhRYb","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"5885 Sawyer Rd.","locality":"Sawyer","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49125","phone":"269-405-1076","website":"http:\/\/www.greenbushbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sunday - Thursday: 12-8\r\nFriday and Saturday: 12-10","latitude":41.8856286,"longitude":-86.5946671,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"smPLMQ","name":"Big Mama Blonde","nameDisplay":"Big Mama Blonde","description":"An \"imperialized\" (amplified) version of our Mother's Beach Blonde.

Please look forward to keeping up to date with us on our progress and exciting new changes to our product range.","website":"http:\/\/www.harviestoun-brewery.co.uk\/","established":"1983","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Ix655q\/upload_oGkvqb-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Ix655q\/upload_oGkvqb-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Ix655q\/upload_oGkvqb-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Ix655q\/upload_oGkvqb-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Ix655q\/upload_oGkvqb-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:57","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:47:51","locations":[{"id":"sAmmqA","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Hillfoots Business Village","locality":"Alva Industrial Estate Alva, Central","region":"Scotland","postalCode":"FK12 5DQ","phone":"44-(01259)-769100","website":"http:\/\/www.harviestoun-brewery.co.uk\/","latitude":56.15306,"longitude":-3.798604,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"GB","yearOpened":"1985","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:57","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"GB","name":"UNITED KINGDOM","displayName":"United Kingdom","isoThree":"GBR","numberCode":826,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"FjbeAQ","name":"Bizarra Blonde Ale","nameDisplay":"Bizarra Blonde Ale","abv":"5","availableId":1,"styleId":36,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/FjbeAQ\/upload_Bkgije-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/FjbeAQ\/upload_Bkgije-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/FjbeAQ\/upload_Bkgije-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-06-27 21:24:23","updateDate":"2015-12-18 02:37:02","available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":36,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Golden or Blonde Ale","shortName":"Blonde","description":"Golden or Blonde ales are straw to golden blonde in color.

With the advent of industrialization, however, local breweries all but disappeared, bringing to an end the era of the authentic microbrewery.\r\n\r\nTwenty years ago, a family of brewers decided to revive the traditions of the past that were deeply rooted in three generations of their family \u2013 thus the name The 3 Brewers \u2013 \u201cthree\u201d for three generations of brewing tradition.
