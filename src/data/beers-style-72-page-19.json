For Ken Landin and Janine Bennett the answer to that question would always be \"listening to live music and drinking craft beer.\" Fueled by their outrage over the political and corporate disaster that unfolded on the nightly news, and frustrated by the thought that their lifestyle may contribute to the problem, they were at a crossroads. And so began the plan for Crossroads Brewing Company.\r\n \r\nThere was many years of discussion, research, paperwork, rejection, and searching for the perfect property.  After having deals fall through and the economy taking a turn for the worse, their hopes were fading. Then, in December of 2008, the Brooks Opera House in Historic Athens was discovered by accident. After leaving a restaurant just 2 miles from home they noticed a for sale sign on the deteriorating building and it's just like the old saying goes............when you know, you know.\r\n \r\nIt was quickly realized that when a community believes in what you are doing and puts it's support behind you, great things can happen. So they were off and running from the first turn of the key. Restoring a Historic Opera House from 1893 was not part of the original plan but with hard work and their secret weapon, Janine's brother Jimmy, things are coming together. Ken, Janine, Jimmy and Janine's Dad, Jim, have had their hands on just about every square inch of this 15,000 square foot building. Little by little, this grand and unique property will be restored to it's former glory.\r\n  \r\nEveryday seems to bring a new challenge but the ultimate goal remains clear. This building was once the hub of this sleepy riverside village and Ken and Janine intend to return it to the community. The second floor, where the Opera House once was, will get a new stage for plays and musical performances of all kinds. Athens is surrounded by hard working farmers so looking any further for meats and produce just doesn't make sense.  From organic menu items to earth friendly building materials the environment is a factor in every decision that is made along the way. They hope to eventually have the brewery running \"off the grid\" as well.\r\n \r\nKen, Janine, Brewer Hutch Kugeman and Chef Paul Parillo invite you to come visit the pub in Athens, NY.  There's 10 craft beers on tap and a menu that showcases the small farms of the Hudson Valley.   Cheers!","website":"http:\/\/crossroadsbrewingco.com\/","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/tE9Evu\/upload_EHTHYJ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/tE9Evu\/upload_EHTHYJ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/tE9Evu\/upload_EHTHYJ-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/tE9Evu\/upload_EHTHYJ-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/tE9Evu\/upload_EHTHYJ-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:11:28","locations":[{"id":"yqQtUG","name":"Brewery & Restaurant","streetAddress":"21 Second Street","locality":"Athens","region":"New York","postalCode":"12015","phone":"518-945-2337","website":"http:\/\/crossroadsbrewingco.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon, Wed & Thurs.: 4:00 pm-9:00 pm\r\nFriday: 4:00 pm-12:00 am\r\nSaturday: 1:00 pm-12:00 am\r\nSunday: 1:00 pm-9:00 pm\r\nClosed Tuesdays","latitude":42.260511,"longitude":-73.8096826,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2010","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"tr0Brr","name":"Maggie\u2019s Peach Farmhouse Ale","nameDisplay":"Maggie\u2019s Peach Farmhouse Ale","description":"Maggie's Peach Farmhouse Ale has all the flavor and aroma of a freshly picked peach combined with the complexity of a well executed farmhouse ale.","abv":"5.3","ibu":"22","glasswareId":10,"srmId":3,"availableId":4,"styleId":72,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/tr0Brr\/upload_JPIafz-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/tr0Brr\/upload_JPIafz-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/tr0Brr\/upload_JPIafz-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"Pair this with a perfect GA farm-fresh lunch; a fried green tomato sandwich with garlic aioli on freshly-baked bread and a spicy arugula salad dressed with Sweet Grass Dairy Thomasville Tomme and fig vinaigrette.","servingTemperature":"cool","servingTemperatureDisplay":"Cool - (8-12C\/45-54F)","originalGravity":"1.046","createDate":"2013-08-14 16:00:41","updateDate":"2016-06-05 00:51:46","glass":{"id":10,"name":"Oversized Wine Glass","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"srm":{"id":3,"name":"3","hex":"FFCA5A"},"available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":72,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"French & Belgian-Style Saison","shortName":"Saison","description":"Beers in this category are golden to deep amber in color.

This journey has opened our eyes (and taste buds) to some of the finest examples of beer this planet has to offer. Our tastes and expectations have forever changed, and so have our methods of enjoyment. From beer trades, to home brewing, to attending release parties and festivals one thing became clear\u2026 We rarely drink the same beer over and over again, and we love to share.\r\n\r\nOur IPAs will be constantly revolving depending on inspiration, hop variety, availability, and season. We will make everything from low gravity Sessions, to Regulars, Doubles, Triples and even a San Diego Pale Ale or two. We will make sure these styles are released, distributed, and tapped\u2026 FRESH!\r\n\r\nWe like big beers and we cannot lie! From the biggest Russian Imperial Stouts aged in spirit barrels to malty Double Reds, Smooth Porters, and velvety Wee Heavies, we just can\u2019t get enough of these complex beauties. Thick mouthfeel, high gravity, and rich flavors suitable for aging to be shared with family and friends. Crack one open to celebrate a special occasion, or just because its a Tuesday.\r\n\r\nMouth puckering sour ales is another style which we adore. One which we hoard, savor, and curse for not being more readily available. Using wine barrels from local Virginia Wineries we will age some carefully crafted super tart ales, blending them when needed and using fruits for character. Once the bugs catch up to our pipeline, expect a new sour to be released every month.\r\n\r\nAt Ocelot, we love two things\u2026 Beer and Music!\r\n\r\nWe believe in inspiration. It can come in many forms and varies from person to person. For us, music has always been our inspiration. Music has been the soundtrack to our lives and has in one way or another crafted every decision we\u2019ve made. We aim to create and dedicate our beers to the music that has inspired our journey through life.\r\n\r\nOcelot Brewing Company is a reflection of us, our styles, and our habits. From chasing freshies to cellaring whales and everything in between. We will craft many different beers in small batches. We brew beer we want to drink when we want to drink it. Come by and visit, listen to some tunes, grab a pint, fill a growler, and join us on this adventure.","website":"http:\/\/ocelotbrewing.com\/","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Qvbd2N\/upload_wfdHi6-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Qvbd2N\/upload_wfdHi6-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Qvbd2N\/upload_wfdHi6-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Qvbd2N\/upload_wfdHi6-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Qvbd2N\/upload_wfdHi6-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-12-12 17:31:01","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:49:14","locations":[{"id":"oPxIne","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"23600 Overland Drive","extendedAddress":"#180","locality":"Sterling","region":"Virginia","postalCode":"20166","phone":"(703) 474-3050","website":"http:\/\/ocelotbrewing.com","latitude":38.9629988,"longitude":-77.4992517,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-12-12 17:31:34","updateDate":"2016-03-22 17:54:38","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"qF1pEY","name":"Maillot Jaune","nameDisplay":"Maillot Jaune","description":"Maillot Jaune, or \"Yellow Shirt\", is named for the jersey of honor given to the leader of the Tour De France bicycle race held every July.

Brad Lincoln first experienced craft beer while working as an accountant in Portland, OR. The two met during the winter of 2009 while attending the Siebel Institute and studying brewing science. After being immersed in beer for the better part of five months, the two graduated and shared a desire to open a brewery. This resulted in the Saison-focused brewery that is now Funkwerks, opening December 9, 2010.\r\n \r\nSaisons originated as Belgian farmhouse ales- brewed during winter months for the farm workers during the summer months. Usually having a dry profile and complex fruity aromas, Saisons today are brewed year-round and generally have a higher alcohol percentage than their original versions.\r\n \r\nFunkwerks\u2019 two flagship beers, Saison and Tropic King, are produced year round. Also brewed annually are four seasonals, a number of small experimental batches, and select barrel-aged releases. Funkwerks flagship Saison was awarded a gold medal at the 2012 Great American Beer Festival (GABF) and a silver medal in 2011. Deceit, a Belgian-Style golden strong ale, was also awarded a gold medal at the GABF in 2012. In addition to receiving two gold medals in 2012, the GABF named Funkwerks the 2012 Small Brewing Company of the Year.\r\n \r\nFunkwerks is located at 1900 East Lincoln Avenue in Fort Collins, Colorado. The tasting room- complete with an indoor bar, retail area and spacious outdoor, dog-friendly patio- is open 7 days a week: Sunday through Thursday from 12pm-8pm; Friday and Saturday from 12pm-9pm. Brewery tours are given Saturdays at 2pm.\r\n \r\nFunkwerks is currently distributed in:\r\nColorado:\r\nC.R.

During \u201cBrew Nights,\u201d friends were made, a community was fostered and a brand was started.\r\n\r\nPine Street Brewery was designed so that our products would be available for many different palates in many different communities.

Both had been home brewing for years, and started brewing together in their back yards in the summer of 2010. The goal of the first brews was to make enough beer for Nate\u2019s upcoming wedding. In the ensuing months the two continued brewing on a regular basis, creating better beers, refining the equipment and process and devising some great new recipes. As they continued to brew together, talk turned to the idea of an eventual commercial venture.\r\n\r\nTJ, a mutual friend of the two brewers noted that he could provide some equipment to allow for some larger brewing projects. Having this greater capacity led to the realization, that as much fun as it might be to try, the three of them would not be able to drink nearly as much as they were certain to produce and the beer would have to be shared with the public. The wheels were officially set in motion to make the jump from hobbyists to professional brewers.\r\n\r\nTo round out the team, the trio turned to some other friends. Drew had joined in on the occasional brewing session, and one of his creations took home a prize at a local brewing competition. Ron brought to the table the business and accounting skills needed to make this a business. Five friends who enjoyed hanging out together had just hit on the magic formula to turn fun into a business.\r\n\r\nBucket opened its pilot brewery in the Lorraine Mills in Pawtucket. The space was a 375 square foot room, and the equipment was largely retooled and designed to create a 1 BBL brewery. The first keg of beer went on tap in November 2012 and within a couple of months it was clear that the demand was huge and a bigger brewery would be needed.\r\n\r\nIn June of 2013, the pilot brewery closed and construction began on a full scale production brewery in August. Located in the mill at 545 Pawtucket Avenue, the new space was nearly 10 times larger at 3400 square feet. With a 10 BBL brewhouse, the production capacity grew ten-fold as well.\r\n\r\nIn the Fall of 2013, brewing began in the new facility and in November, Bucket Brewery was officially opened to the public. In addition to the kegs of beer that were the exclusive packaging in the pilot site, Bucket started shipping beer in 64oz and 32oz containers. The beer has beer very well received by our Rhode Island customers and the brewery continues to grow!\r\n\r\nBucket now holds tours and tastings every Saturday, as well as the Friday Night Sound Check music and art series, and other events.","website":"http:\/\/bucketbrewery.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ZB3WRj\/upload_a6AxDn-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ZB3WRj\/upload_a6AxDn-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ZB3WRj\/upload_a6AxDn-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ZB3WRj\/upload_a6AxDn-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ZB3WRj\/upload_a6AxDn-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-21 13:02:25","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:05:11","locations":[{"id":"PwIQok","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"545 Pawtucket Ave","locality":"Pawtucket","region":"Rhode Island","postalCode":"02860","website":"bucketbrewery.com","hoursOfOperation":"Friday 1:00-7:30 \r\nSaturday 11:00-5:00","latitude":41.859093,"longitude":-71.398175,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-21 13:02:26","updateDate":"2015-11-19 22:15:08","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"sBTXRJ","name":"Merica","nameDisplay":"Merica","description":"Merica is a single malt, single hop farmhouse ale.

The Bethlehem Steel plant had been shutting down slowly for years \u2013 a dying industrial giant of a bygone day \u2013 and the region was suffering the loss hard. The downtown had also been bled by the malls and box stores that promised savings to the consumer in exchange for genuine local culture and community. Yet on April 15th, 1998, the same day the the historic Hotel Bethlehem declared bankruptcy and closed, the Bethlehem Brew Works optimistically opened its doors to the public at the corner of Main and Broad Streets. The one other restaurant in the neighborhood closed the following week.\r\n\r\nBethlehem Brew Works chose to ignore the public exodus, and instead celebrated the history of \u2018Steel\u2019 and paid tribute to the region\u2019s working class culture in it\u2019s decor and menu. The Fegley\u2019s believed a transformation was already well underway, and would grow with the city as it came to life. Over the course of a dozen years, the family became more involved in the community, and worked with the downtown shop owners to strengthen the downtown. One by one, new restaurants began open, and stores began to keep longer hours to accommodate the growing crowds. Historic Bethlehem now is home to a burgeoning restaurant row and retail shops of all kinds.\r\n2002\r\n\r\nMost importantly, the restaurant and brewery grew as well. The Steelgaarden lounge was added, and quickly became a Valley hotspot, and a few years later, the lounge exanded again, annexing another two shop spaces for more nightlife and event space. The kitchen also tripled in size with new space, and the brewery added additional tanks to keep up with the demand for the brews.\r\n2005\r\n\r\nWith an eye still on things to come, the family looked west into Allentown. Opportunity was difficult to see in a city who\u2019s retail heyday had ended some years before with the departure of Hess\u2019s department store. But the optimistic Fegleys became smitten with the history of the \u201cQueen city\u201d \u2013 from it\u2019s role in the War of Independence, to the great silk industry that supplied the world\u2019s fashions, and the great retail era the followed. \u201cThe All-American City\u201d as it was known, seemed to be frosted over \u2013 and the Fegleys believed it was about to thaw.\r\n2007\r\n\r\nIn June 2007, years in the making, the Allentown Brew Works opened on Hamilton Street, housed inside the historic Harold\u2019s Furniture Building. Proud to be part of another resurging downtown, the 400 seat restaurant is a testament to the vibrant heartbeat that thrives in the city. Offering two and a half levels of dining, plus state-of-the-art banquet facilities in The Hamilton Room, and multiple bars offering different atmospheres, as well as an outdoor casual patio, Der Biergarten and a new seductive lower level lounge, Silk. The 15-barrel brewery in the Allentown location boasts seven fermentation tanks and eight serving tanks \u2013 built with capacity to add a bottling line and begin outside sales of Fegley\u2019s Brew Works in earnest.\r\n2008\r\n\r\nIn 2008, the Philadelphia Phillies AAA team, the Iron Pigs, opened the new Coca-Cola Park stadium, and added Fegley\u2019s Brew Works to its lineup. With that account in place, and a new sales team behind the brewery sales, Fegley\u2019s Brew Works can now be found at almost 200 locations in the region from Harrisburg to central New Jersey, north to Scranton, and south to Philadelphia where it is very popular.\r\n2010\r\n\r\nOne of the nation\u2019s leading beer writers and co-founder of Philly Beer Week, Don Russell (aka Joe Sixpack), named Hop\u2019Solutely the Beer of the Year.\r\n\r\nBecoming supportive and active in the Allentown community, during their first few years the Brew Works saw eateries come and go. In 2010, the tide seemed to change with major restaurants adding to the draw of the city. For some time, the Fegleys had been constantly thinking up good ideas that they would love to see happen in the neighborhood, when it finally struck them that they should just do it themselves. In an effort to continue to move the Fegley brand toward healthy, sustainable \u201cgreen\u201d practices, they chose concepts that would fit that ideal.\r\n2011 to Present\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Fegley\u2019s brewery continues to be recognized as their Arctic Alchemy wins it\u2019s first bronze medal at the Great American Beer Festival and Blueberry Belch wins \u201cBest Summer Beer\u201d at the Philadelphia Summer Ale Festival at the Philadelphia Zoo .

While the small 5 gallon batches allowed for plenty of great experience, they yearned for more creative control.\r\n\r\nThe brewers decided it was time for a more professional three vessel system, giving them complete control over the brewing process. The 1\/2 barrel system gave the brewers a solid platform to refine and perfect a lineup of beers for the most discerning pallet. This led to the creation of several great recipes, and a roster of clean crisp beers. The original hobby transformed into a passion for sharing world-class hand crafted beers with those who would appreciate them. \r\n\r\nLevante Brewing currently brews on our 15 bbl production brewery system located in West Chester, PA.

They were allowed to borrow the canteen in the school's closing and began to brew. This meant however that most of the brew was made between the hours of 22 and 6 on weekdays, which resulted in some hard school day for both the two pupils and the teacher, but the beer was appreciated by all the school (near the school cafeteria, which grumbled over filth ).\r\n\r\nLater created Mikkel brewery Mikkeller , which has garnered wide international recognition, while Tobias and Tore moved their production into their parents' basement after they were dropped out of high school.

Always looking to take a good thing too far, we sat down and over a beer (or two) decided that beer itself was a good idea. Of course, not just some easy-drinking institutional prole beer, but stuff like the beers we'd had at great bars. We had frequented places with extensive and varied beer lists. Places with lists 180 items long, all of which we tried twice (not in one night). In short, we wanted beer with flavor. Complexity. Character. Intensity. Not words found in the mass market lexicon.\r\n\r\nSo with a banjo burner, a bunch of industrial kitchen sized pots and as many buckets as we could find, we jumped in feet first. Once a week, every week. We tried to emulate the beers we liked, but soon we were adding a little of this, or some of that and after a while we started having a hard time pegging our beer in a style category. Our first success was a Porter that was mainly porter, slightly stout. We ran it blind with our friends against the porters we liked and people liked it. \"We're on to something\", we thought. Twenty iterations, modifications and tweaks later it is Distorter, and is still our favorite beer.\r\n\r\nThis led to twice a week brewing and handing out bottle after bottle to everyone we knew. Along the way we screwed up a wheat beer by accidentally making it into sort of a copper ale with a few too many hops. And so Red Bud Ale was born. We had some extra noble hops and threw them in the IPA, and with some tinkering we most certainly had a one-of-a-kind IPA. You get the picture. All of this has firmly cemented our \"anything goes\" approach to beer making. Our inability to ever get quite within the style guidelines means we may never win an award, but we're ok with that.\r\n\r\nNow, several years later and with a 90% super-cool\/10% Rube Goldberg 7 bbl version of our banjo burner and kitchen pots, we're befuddling the beer judges and converting the masses. One pint at a time.\r\n\r\nStop in the storefront and try our mainstays, seasonals and small-batch runs. Not to mention our lab beers, where we continue to screw up one thing or another in search of the next great beer.","website":"http:\/\/www.greenbushbrewing.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:19:53","locations":[{"id":"AlhRYb","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"5885 Sawyer Rd.","locality":"Sawyer","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49125","phone":"269-405-1076","website":"http:\/\/www.greenbushbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sunday - Thursday: 12-8\r\nFriday and Saturday: 12-10","latitude":41.8856286,"longitude":-86.5946671,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"3DqVYS","name":"Mullineaux (made when I feel like it)","nameDisplay":"Mullineaux (made when I feel like it)","description":"Cette bi\u00e8re ese pour vous mere.

At 6.2% ABV, it\u2019s a bit higher than your strictly traditional farmhouse. The wheat and oats makes the mouthfeel silky and light at the same time. They also bring some additional cloudiness to this unfiltered brew. The peppery-spice character develops during a fairly warm fermentation (78\u00b0F) using the Forbidden Fruit Yeast strain and not any actual spice addition to the beer. Hopped with Styrian Goldings and finished with Saaz, this beer has a noticeable hoppy dryness which makes it a fine thirst quencher which is something the original Farmhouse Ales were intended to be. These beers would be served to workers out in the fields on hot summer days as a restorative. Muse will be available in May 2009.\r\n\r\nOpen a bottle and enjoy this natural beauty while imagining yourself out in the flat fields of Belgium!
