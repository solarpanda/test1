Anne Dawson opened the mill in 1822 at the mouth of the Manayunk Canal and the Krook family followed with the existing building just short of 100 years later in 1912. A cornerstone from the original mill was placed in the new building. Krook's Mill eventually closed its doors in 1992.\r\n\r\nFour years later, Harry Renner IV brought the facility back to life as a space for retail business, a fine eatery, a brewery and as an entertainment complex for both neighbors and visitors alike to enjoy.

This was the second business venture for Corcoran whom had been making award winning wines since 2004. Corcoran which is family owned and operated decided in 2011 to branch out into the hand crafted beer industry. Initially started in a barn on old farmland near Corcoran Vineyards, this combination became Virginia\u2019s first vineyard \/ brewery combo in the state. After several years of growing business it was realized that there was not enough room to stay as demand for the beer grew. In early 2014 the brewery was moved to Purcellville Virginia which is about 6 miles from where it started.\r\n\r\nCorcoran Brewing Company has produced over thirty three distinct beers since opening day. We strive to create both traditional beer types as well as creating unique experiences with experimental beers. On any given day we have twelve beers on tap ranging from Kolch style, American Pale Ales, IPA\u2019s, Imperial IPA\u2019s, Stouts, Bourbon barrel aged, port barrel aged and more. This daily broad selection of quality hand-made craft beers has been a primary reason for our success.
