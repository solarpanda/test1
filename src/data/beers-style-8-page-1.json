We hope to engender the spirit of camaraderie and hard work that we imagine those living and brewing in this neighborhood at that time embodied.\r\n\r\nWe self distribute our beer, which means each beer that you drink in a bar or restaurant is poured from a keg that we delivered cold in our refrigerated van (keep your eyes peeled for it around town). We like to keep beer as fresh as possible, which means that every keg we fill is immediately moved into cold storage where it sits until we load it onto our refrigerated van for delivery to the coldbox of each local account.

Jason Hendricks and Jason Schlaff met in the fall of  2009.  They didn\u2019t know then that their friendship would bloom, but when it did, a brewery would be the flower.\r\n\r\nThe Jasons started humbly with a five gallon pot, a homebrew starter kit, and an idea of what good should be.  The first brew was just ok, an American Ale extract kit that did not allow for any artistry.  They quickly realized they needed to switch things up in order to attain the flavors they wanted.  So, the two amateurs ventured into the world of all-grain brewing.  The first mash tun, a cooler, the first brew, a porter.  Jason and Jason had their first failure.  \r\n\r\nPoor taste and terrible color ruined their tongues but not their spirit.  They could do much much better.   Schlaff, an avid reader and researcher, dove head first into every book he could find.  Hendricks scoured the internet and talked to every expert he could find.  Armed with brains full of knowledge the two gents embarked on the brewing adventure again.  \r\n\r\nThe second beer, a blonde ale, crafted with the newfound comprehension they acquired.  After a two weeks of eager anticipation, success!  The Jasons now had the knowledge, the drive, and the skill.  Each ale after that was instant hit among their friends and family.  Gary Schlaff, Jason\u2019s distinguished father, joined the endeavor in 2013.  Gary, a marketing genius, is nearing retirement and has decided to throw his business knowledge into the mix.\r\n\r\nThe brewery itself will not serve or prepare food.  Patrons will be allowed to bring in outside food, as well as have food delivered to them at the brewery.\r\n\r\nWe strive to be as sustainable and as local as possible.  The brewhouse and fermenters will be purchased for Psycho Brew LLC of Greenville, MI.  Our hops will be purchased from the many growers in Michigan.  Our spent grain will be sold to local farmers instead of going to waste in a landfill.  As a side project, we will also used the spent grain to made organic dog treats.","website":"http:\/\/fbcbrewing.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ohbgYE\/upload_WwIcxm-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ohbgYE\/upload_WwIcxm-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ohbgYE\/upload_WwIcxm-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ohbgYE\/upload_WwIcxm-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ohbgYE\/upload_WwIcxm-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-11-24 00:48:05","updateDate":"2016-04-10 21:15:30","locations":[{"id":"fSqavF","name":"Farmington Brewing Company","streetAddress":"33336 Grand River","locality":"Farmington","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"48336","phone":"(248) 957-9543","website":"http:\/\/fbcbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Wed:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\nThu:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\nFri:  4:00pm - 11:00pm\nSat:  2:00pm - 11:00pm\nSun:  2:00pm - 9:00pm\n\n","latitude":42.464946,"longitude":-83.375958,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2014","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-11-24 00:51:59","updateDate":"2016-04-10 21:15:14","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"edGwrn","name":"Cernunnos","nameDisplay":"Cernunnos","abv":"8.5","ibu":"25","styleId":8,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-04-06 14:01:09","updateDate":"2015-04-06 14:01:09","style":{"id":8,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Scottish-Style Heavy Ale","shortName":"Scottish Heavy","description":"Scottish heavy ale is moderate in strength and dominated by a smooth, sweet maltiness balanced with low, but perceptible, hop bitterness.

We are proud and excited to bring this wonderful piece of Rockford history back to life and look forward to exceeding expectations.","website":"http:\/\/www.rockfordbrewingco.com\/","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/y8IIGV\/upload_UYyn3q-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/y8IIGV\/upload_UYyn3q-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/y8IIGV\/upload_UYyn3q-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/y8IIGV\/upload_UYyn3q-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/y8IIGV\/upload_UYyn3q-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-15 07:26:15","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:58:48","locations":[{"id":"sr0F35","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"200 Prairie St","locality":"Rockford","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"61107","hoursOfOperation":"Sun:  11:00am - 10:00pm\nMon:  11:00am - 10:00pm\nTue:  11:00am - 10:00pm\nWed:  11:00am - 10:00pm\nThu:  11:00am - 12:00am\nFri:  11:00am - 2:00am\nSat:  11:00am - 2:00am\n\n","latitude":42.273299,"longitude":-89.087174,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-15 16:52:34","updateDate":"2014-09-15 16:52:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"C6wWvy","name":"Charles The Second Scotch Ale","nameDisplay":"Charles The Second Scotch Ale","description":"Named after the Brtish \"Merrie Monarch\" who lost the Civil war to Oliver Cromwell in the Battle of Worcester in 1651.

The brewery was established by Hugh Sisson in 1995. Previously, Sisson operated Maryland's first brewpub, Sisson's. The brewery is named for the famed Clipper ship - first developed and built in the home port of Baltimore. While the name of the company remains Clipper City Brewing Company, all of its beer falls under the Heavy Seas brand. Heavy Seas is located at 4615 Hollins Ferry Road, Suite B, in the Halethorpe section of Baltimore. Heavy Seas currently offers a variety of beer styles in approx. 18 states within the United States.\r\n\r\nHeavy Seas mission is to bring back the local brewery, and to do it in such a way that we are more than just a fringe player, but a positive part of our area. To accomplish this mission we have created a broad portfolio of products with enough diversity that we have at least one beer that can appeal to everyone. Whether your preference is for a classic American style lager beer, or a big, challenging Hop Cubed Ale, we have a something that will suit your taste. We believe in bringing beer drinkers the quality and flavor of a handcrafted beer while supporting the local communities we serve.","website":"http:\/\/www.hsbeer.com\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wTFQaf\/upload_DPoml0-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wTFQaf\/upload_DPoml0-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wTFQaf\/upload_DPoml0-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wTFQaf\/upload_DPoml0-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wTFQaf\/upload_DPoml0-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:43:22","locations":[{"id":"yX6twV","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"4615-B Hollins Ferry Road","locality":"Baltimore","region":"Maryland","postalCode":"21227","phone":"410-247-7822","website":"http:\/\/www.hsbeer.com\/","latitude":39.230827,"longitude":-76.6751309,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2014-11-20 13:52:46","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"vh3ZUn","name":"Heavy Seas Alehouse - Baltimore","streetAddress":"1300 Bank Street","locality":"Baltimore","region":"Maryland","postalCode":"21231","phone":"(410) 753-1403","website":"http:\/\/heavyseasalehouse.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  4:00pm - 12:00am\nTue:  4:00pm - 12:00am\nWed:  4:00pm - 12:00am\nThu:  4:00pm - 12:00am\nFri:  12:00pm - 2:00am\nSat:  12:00pm - 2:00am\nSun:  11:00am - 12:00am\n\n","latitude":39.286626,"longitude":-76.598808,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"restaurant","locationTypeDisplay":"Restaurant\/Ale House","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-05-23 22:13:06","updateDate":"2014-11-20 13:51:07","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"gmfbj6","name":"Heavy Seas Alehouse - Arlington","streetAddress":"1501 Wilson Blvd","locality":"Arlington","region":"Virginia","postalCode":"22209","phone":"(703) 879-4388","website":"http:\/\/heavyseasalehouse.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  11:00am - 12:00am\nTue:  11:00am - 12:00am\nWed:  11:00am - 12:00am\nThu:  11:00am - 12:00am\nFri:  11:00am - 2:00am\nSat:  11:00am - 2:00am\nSun:  11:00am - 12:00am\n\n","latitude":38.8952016,"longitude":-77.0742466,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"restaurant","locationTypeDisplay":"Restaurant\/Ale House","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-11-20 13:52:30","updateDate":"2014-11-20 13:52:46","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"mrZabu","name":"Drafty Kilt","nameDisplay":"Drafty Kilt","description":"A roasty scotch ale with a hint of smoke.

An accomplished home brewer since 1995, Yager has designed numerous seasonal and specialty batches, from the Dark Hammer Belgian Quad to the UberAlt sticke ale. Other recurring ales are more experimental, blending styles, as with Tobacco Road, an imperial amber designed to complement a good cigar, or the occasional Lonesome Hop series, which spotlights the character of an individual hop. Yellowhammer is Yager's first commercial undertaking.\r\n\r\nYellowhammer Brewing opened on Oct. 16, 2010 with the best-selling Belgian white ale and the IPA. Other staples sold throughout the year include a German style altbier and the Miracle Worker, a potent Belgian tripel.","website":"http:\/\/www.yellowhammerbrewery.com\/","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BI8mE7\/upload_Kf31WU-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BI8mE7\/upload_Kf31WU-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BI8mE7\/upload_Kf31WU-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BI8mE7\/upload_Kf31WU-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BI8mE7\/upload_Kf31WU-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:13","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:23:20","locations":[{"id":"4V6C7Y","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2406 Clinton Avenue","locality":"West Huntsville","region":"Alabama","postalCode":"35805","phone":"256-975-5950","website":"http:\/\/www.yellowhammerbrewery.com\/","latitude":34.722525,"longitude":-86.603703,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2010","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:13","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"mVrwzD","name":"Full Boar","nameDisplay":"Full Boar","description":"Full Boar\u2122 Scotch Ale is deeply malted and caramel apparent with overtones of chocolate and a slight hint of a mild, smoky flavor.\r\n\r\nOur Full Boar Scotch Ale\u2019s proprietary malt blend, lightly smoked with peat moss, imparts subtle hints of chocolate, caramel and smoke in a beer that drinks astonishingly smoothly.","abv":"7.4","ibu":"12","glasswareId":5,"availableId":1,"styleId":8,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/mVrwzD\/upload_R3fvpM-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/mVrwzD\/upload_R3fvpM-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/mVrwzD\/upload_R3fvpM-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"First-Class chefs pair this Wee Heavy style ale with the finest cuts of meat, yet it has been infused into everything from artisanal cheeses to ice cream.","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:15","updateDate":"2016-05-03 19:42:59","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":8,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Scottish-Style Heavy Ale","shortName":"Scottish Heavy","description":"Scottish heavy ale is moderate in strength and dominated by a smooth, sweet maltiness balanced with low, but perceptible, hop bitterness.
