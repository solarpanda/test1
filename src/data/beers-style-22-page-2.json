This was the second business venture for Corcoran whom had been making award winning wines since 2004. Corcoran which is family owned and operated decided in 2011 to branch out into the hand crafted beer industry. Initially started in a barn on old farmland near Corcoran Vineyards, this combination became Virginia\u2019s first vineyard \/ brewery combo in the state. After several years of growing business it was realized that there was not enough room to stay as demand for the beer grew. In early 2014 the brewery was moved to Purcellville Virginia which is about 6 miles from where it started.\r\n\r\nCorcoran Brewing Company has produced over thirty three distinct beers since opening day. We strive to create both traditional beer types as well as creating unique experiences with experimental beers. On any given day we have twelve beers on tap ranging from Kolch style, American Pale Ales, IPA\u2019s, Imperial IPA\u2019s, Stouts, Bourbon barrel aged, port barrel aged and more. This daily broad selection of quality hand-made craft beers has been a primary reason for our success.

But the Old Lompoc Brewery (as it was formerly know) has been producing handcrafted ales and lagers since December 1996, while the tavern has been open since 1993.\r\n\r\nThe name originally came from the movie \u2018The Bank Dick\u2019 starring W.C. Fields and Mae West. Most of the movie took place in the \u2018Old Lompoc House\u2019, which was the local watering hole as well as a boarding house.\r\n\r\nOur food menu is an excellent array of Northwest pub fare with a great selection of entrees, soups and salads. We have also remodeled the patio and added a sun deck.","website":"http:\/\/www.lompocbrewing.com\/","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gPm93w\/upload_HIK3tR-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gPm93w\/upload_HIK3tR-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gPm93w\/upload_HIK3tR-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gPm93w\/upload_HIK3tR-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gPm93w\/upload_HIK3tR-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03
