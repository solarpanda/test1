He started the Boulder, Colorado company with the 'natural philosophy' that he produce the highest quality honey wine on the market.\r\n\r\nBecause of this 'philosophy of mead', Redstone does not cork (to avoid oxidation) but instead uses swing top bottles. This ensures the mead will not breathe while cellaring plus offers a much longer shelf life once the bottle has been opened.\r\n\r\nIn keeping with the 'natural' approach, Redstone does not add any sulfites, a known allergen, as honey is it's own natural preservative. Redstone only pasteurizes the must (unfermented mead) and never boils. The company strives to feature the flavors of the fermentable as much as possible.\r\n\r\nIn 2003 Redstone Meadery brought the International Mead Festival (www.meadfest.com) to Boulder, Colorado and with that helped to establish mead as its own beverage category. Also at this time Redstone spearheaded the creation of the International Mead Association (www.meadfest.org) to help promote and educate the masses about the world's first fermented beverage.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Redstone products are distributed to 20 states across the U.S., making it the widest distributed wine from the state of Colorado and one of the most widely distributed meads in the country!

Several years later, we found friends that were home brewing mead with good results. We decided to try our hand at it too.\r\n\r\nIn February 2006, we entered our first competition and took Best in Show out of over 210 entries in the home mead-maker category at the International Mead Association\u2019s Mead Festival. The competition was judged by seven professionals in the mead industry; including Ken Schramm, author of The Compleat Mead Maker, and meadery owners from around the world. The Best in Show prize was selected from the gold medal winners in nine categories. Our \u201cStarrlight Mulled Apple Cyser\u201d was awarded not only the gold medal in the cyser (mead made with apples) category, but was also selected as the best overall representation of mead making. It was at that point we decided to try creating a business from our love of mead.\r\n\r\nBen shares his expertise and love of brewing by conducting demonstrations and workshops on mead making in the local community. We also organize and conduct the local Mead Day celebration each August (since 2005) and are a key part of the product tasting team for mead reviews on Gotmead.com. Becky worked with Chatham Hill Winery for 2 years learning tasting room and wine club management. We are members of the Chatham County Beekeepers Association, and the NC Winegrowers Association.","website":"http:\/\/starrlightmead.com","established":"2009","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Hdz6Zk\/upload_GiHF7L-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Hdz6Zk\/upload_GiHF7L-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Hdz6Zk\/upload_GiHF7L-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Hdz6Zk\/upload_GiHF7L-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Hdz6Zk\/upload_GiHF7L-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-06-27 15:30:02","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:44:11","locations":[{"id":"XPKDbB","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"480 Hillsboro Street","extendedAddress":"Suite 1000","locality":"Pittsboro","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"27312","phone":"919-533-6314","website":"http:\/\/starrlightmead.com","hoursOfOperation":"Regular Hours\r\nThursdays and Fridays from noon til 6 pm\r\n\r\nSaturdays from noon til 6 pm\r\nMeadery tours at 1 pm, 3 pm & 5 pm.\r\n\r\nSundays from 1 pm til 5 pm\r\nMeadery tours at 2 pm & 4 pm.","latitude":35.7269418,"longitude":-79.1752021,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"meadery","locationTypeDisplay":"Meadery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-06-27 15:32:51","updateDate":"2015-07-13 19:07:23","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"ZqV5J3","name":"Scorn","nameDisplay":"Scorn","description":"This is one of our limited release meads only available in limited quantities.

He started the Boulder, Colorado company with the 'natural philosophy' that he produce the highest quality honey wine on the market.\r\n\r\nBecause of this 'philosophy of mead', Redstone does not cork (to avoid oxidation) but instead uses swing top bottles. This ensures the mead will not breathe while cellaring plus offers a much longer shelf life once the bottle has been opened.\r\n\r\nIn keeping with the 'natural' approach, Redstone does not add any sulfites, a known allergen, as honey is it's own natural preservative. Redstone only pasteurizes the must (unfermented mead) and never boils. The company strives to feature the flavors of the fermentable as much as possible.\r\n\r\nIn 2003 Redstone Meadery brought the International Mead Festival (www.meadfest.com) to Boulder, Colorado and with that helped to establish mead as its own beverage category. Also at this time Redstone spearheaded the creation of the International Mead Association (www.meadfest.org) to help promote and educate the masses about the world's first fermented beverage.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Redstone products are distributed to 20 states across the U.S., making it the widest distributed wine from the state of Colorado and one of the most widely distributed meads in the country!
