They met in September 2002 in the tiny Scottish village of St. Andrews, Scotland. Bailey was a Harvard student doing a semester abroad and Robyn was beginning undergrad at St. Andrews. They bonded over being put into the worst dorm for overseas orientation and teaching Danish people how to play beer pong. Though after three months Bailey went back to Cambridge, you can't break the bonds that are made when teaching Europeans drinking games and a true friendship was born. During the next eight years, they both graduated, Bailey went off to Vanderbilt Law School, and Robyn entered the working world, but both thought they were meant for much bigger and more alcoholic things.","website":"http:\/\/www.jackalopebrew.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/p1tFbP\/upload_FgvJzY-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/p1tFbP\/upload_FgvJzY-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/p1tFbP\/upload_FgvJzY-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/p1tFbP\/upload_FgvJzY-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/p1tFbP\/upload_FgvJzY-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:04:10","locations":[{"id":"Syl46S","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"701 8th Avenue South","locality":"Nashville","region":"Tennessee","postalCode":"37203","phone":"857-998-2571","website":"http:\/\/www.jackalopebrew.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Thursday: 4PM - 8PM\r\nFriday: 4PM - 8PM\r\nSaturday: 4PM - 8PM","latitude":36.1503749,"longitude":-86.779494,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"NlwCS1","name":"Cyclone Series Luke","nameDisplay":"Cyclone Series Luke","description":"India style red ale.","abv":"8.6","styleId":14,"isOrganic":"Y","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-06-30 21:01:46","updateDate":"2015-06-30 21:01:46","style":{"id":14,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Strong Ale","shortName":"Strong Ale","description":"Light amber to mid-range brown in color, strong ales are medium to full bodied with a malty sweetness and may have low levels of roast malt character.

During his college days the head brewer, Derek Luke, reaquired a homebrewing kit he had given his sister and quickly went to work brewing and passing his knowledge along to the company's president, Brent Ryan. As Graduation grew near and the cold reality of post-collegiate life set in Luke and Ryan knew that they could turn their affinity for beer and their new found ability to make it into a viable alternative to unemployment or sitting at a desk answering to \"The Man\". Of course, they couldn't do it by themselves, so after very little convincing, they got roommate and friends, Mark Sinclair and Will Rafferty to join them.\r\n\r\nOn Father's Day in 1999, after almost two years of planning and preperation, the first batch of Hurricane Amber Ale was brewed. By July 2nd the first kegs had been shipped to three Newport Restaurants and were quickly tapped and emptied. A little over a month after the release of the first kegs, 6-packs of Hurricane Amber Ale began to hit the shelves. Since then we have expanded our product line and our distribution territory but continue to brew up a storm in our Middletown Brewery.","website":"http:\/\/www.newportstorm.com\/","established":"1999","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/IphbdN\/upload_FchmX0-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/IphbdN\/upload_FchmX0-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/IphbdN\/upload_FchmX0-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/IphbdN\/upload_FchmX0-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/IphbdN\/upload_FchmX0-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:43:44","locations":[{"id":"oz1oll","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"307 Oliphant Lane","locality":"Middletown","region":"Rhode Island","postalCode":"02842","phone":"401-849-5232","website":"http:\/\/www.newportstorm.com\/","latitude":41.5369904,"longitude":-71.2796012,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1999","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2014-09-26 13:18:19","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"GovoeE","name":"Damned Spot Scotch Ale","nameDisplay":"Damned Spot Scotch Ale","description":"Assistant Brewer Chris Borgia\u2019s first recipe.
