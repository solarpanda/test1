Nothing strange about that, we love to brew all sorts of beers!\r\n\r\nThis time we were looking to make the un-lawnmower beer (with an emphisis on the \u201cUN\u201d). Just how do we go about doing that? How about by starting with some of the world\u2019s greatest pilsner malt from Weyermann in Bamberg, Germany? There\u2019s no rice and corn in our darling either \u2013 just the best malted barley for purpose in the world. What else? All of the hops used in brewing American Darling come from the Hallertau hop region of Germany. Fermentation uses a blend of three of Europe\u2019s great lager yeasts, low temperature fermentation and lagering, over a period of six weeks. Yes, that\u2019s the UN lawnmower beer.\r\n\r\nThe next step in the process is to filter so that it can be more portable, without sediment to worry about disturbing. Put it in your coolers, your picnic baskets\u2026 your saddlebags. Take it to family reunions and pie eating contests, parades, beaches, fancy mustache conventions, hot dog factory tours, monorail excursions, secret basement lairs\u2026 wherever good summer fun happens!\r\n\r\nThen fire up the grill, not just once \u2013 how about like every day!

Bitter orange peel was added in the boil along with the hops to further enhance and contribute to the citrusy quality of the beer. The resulting mixture was then fermented with a blend of Belgian Wit yeast and Champagne yeast to ensure a hearty fermentation and to add that perfect Champagne-like fruitiness to make this the quintessential Dogfish Head Brew Year\u2019s toast.  Champ\u2019Pain Domain pours cloudy from the Wit yeast, which traditionally stays in suspension to enhance the flavor of the beer style, as well as the large addition of New Zealand and Australian dry hops which add a natural haze.  Notes of light tropical fruit, cider, and white grape dominate the profile, along with background hints of rosewater, mint, and a gentle acidic finish.

We have a DIY ethic when it comes to our beer, our brewery and our business - in other words, we prefer to do things our own way (often, the hard way).  All of our beers' recipes were designed and perfected by us, and even our 5-barrel brewing system was custom built by the Jackrabbit crew.

His family was collecting rice from farmers as land taxes for the Mito Tokugawa family. He began his brewery with the idea of using the remaining rice stocks in the warehouse. At this time in Japan a new political movement began to reform the Tokugawa regime. Fujita Toko, one of the movement's activists, advocated an ideology to build a new organizational government with a reverence of the emperor, and his thought led to the Meiji Restoration.\r\n\r\nFujita was a close friend of Kiuchi, who named one of his sakes \"KIKUSAKARI\" as a respect to the emperor. KIKU (chrysanthemum) is a crest of the imperial household, and SAKARI means 'property'.\r\n\r\n1950's Mikio Kiuchi inherited the brewery legacy in 1950. It was the time when the sake industry flourished as the rapid growth of Japan's economy after the World War II. Although many sake breweries started mass producing low quality sake due to increased demand, Kiuchi Brewery maintained their policy of pursuing the best quality of sake with the optimum ingredients and craftsman-ship.\r\n\r\nHitachino Beer In autumn 1996, Kiuchi started beer brewing business, named the brand \"HITACHINO NEST BEER\" with unique owl character logo.\r\nOver the years, Kiuchi Brewery has gained Japan and worldwide attention by winning awards at numerous world beer competitions.\r\nIn 2000, Brew on Premises facilities has opened to introduce the Lager is the main stream in the beer industries in Japan.\r\n\r\nShochu Kiuchi Kiuchi built a Distillation facility in March, 2003. to aid with recycling and reduction of waste, beginning with the production of \"Shochu Kiuchi\" Distilled liquor made from Sakekasu (Sake lees) which is the by-product of Sake Brewing.\r\n\r\nThe wine brewing project is the latest challenge of Kiuchi Brewery. Kiuchi bought 4000 square meters of land next to the brewery for the vineyard. The grape seedlings, Merlot and Chardoney were imported from France. The vineyard produced its first crop in 2000.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, 3 tonnes of grapes were harvested producing 2000 Litres of Wine. This wine is hoped to be able to offer on a market as another prestigious Kiuchi brand in the near future...","website":"http:\/\/www.kodawari.cc\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/a2GCv8\/upload_CkHjaS-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/a2GCv8\/upload_CkHjaS-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/a2GCv8\/upload_CkHjaS-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/a2GCv8\/upload_CkHjaS-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/a2GCv8\/upload_CkHjaS-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:59","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:49:44","locations":[{"id":"01Bp2T","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1257 Kounosu","locality":"Naka-shi","region":"Ibaraki","phone":"+81 (0)29-298-0105","website":"http:\/\/www.kodawari.cc\/","latitude":36.46801,"longitude":140.475563,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"JP","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:59","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"JP","name":"JAPAN","displayName":"Japan","isoThree":"JPN","numberCode":392,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Jn1nmK","name":"Hogs Back Hogstar","nameDisplay":"Hogs Back Hogstar","description":"A new style of English Lager with a lot more flavour and aroma, using 5 different hops and matured for much longer than normal.","abv":"4.5","styleId":138,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/Jn1nmK\/upload_ZsyYKK-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/Jn1nmK\/upload_ZsyYKK-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/Jn1nmK\/upload_ZsyYKK-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-01-15 17:36:59","updateDate":"2016-01-15 17:40:44","style":{"id":138,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Other Strong Ale or Lager","shortName":"Strong Ale","description":"Any style of beer can be made stronger than the classic style guidelines.
