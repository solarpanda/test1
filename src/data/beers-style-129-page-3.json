The original brewery was built by Nick and Simon in a run down warehouse located in Hammond, Indiana. The first beers brewed by the brothers were designed to be a departure from the fairly bleak craft brewing scene in the region. Nick and Simon brewed intense balanced beers that were and still remain \u201cnot normal\u201d by conventional standards.\r\n\r\nIn November of 2005, after receiving numerous visitors to the brewery over the years, Three Floyds opened its own brewpub at the production facility. What was once office space is now a refuge for the craft beer enthusiast. With all the Three Floyds mainstays, seasonal offerings, special small batch beers and many guest beers it is a mecca for craft beer. The pub also has a full service kitchen providing pub fare of the best quality supported by a 3000 square foot organic herb and vegetable garden.","website":"http:\/\/www.3floyds.com","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/iodDki\/upload_Va4zor-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/iodDki\/upload_Va4zor-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/iodDki\/upload_Va4zor-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/iodDki\/upload_Va4zor-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/iodDki\/upload_Va4zor-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2016-07-29 12:02:44","locations":[{"id":"71LkGn","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"9750 Indiana Parkway","locality":"Munster","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"46321","phone":"1-219-922-3565","website":"http:\/\/www.threefloydspub.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nTue:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nWed:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nThu:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nFri:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nSat:  12:00pm - 2:00am\r\nSun:  12:00pm - 12:00am","latitude":41.535541,"longitude":-87.516686,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2015-06-18 14:42:36","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"GoDmMT","name":"Munster","streetAddress":"9750 Indiana Parkway","locality":"Munster","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"46321","phone":"219-922-4425","website":"http:\/\/www.3floyds.com\/","latitude":41.535536,"longitude":-87.516687,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:16","updateDate":"2015-04-01 18:55:51","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"CDrDdj","name":"Roll Down the Windows Dad, Smoke Lager","nameDisplay":"Roll Down the Windows Dad, Smoke Lager","description":"A very dark lager, brewed with both German and American Malts.

We can't wait to share our beer with Charlotte and beyond and look forward welcoming everyone to our spacious tap room very soon.","website":"http:\/\/triplecbrewing.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wtU6qB\/upload_rHErGK-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wtU6qB\/upload_rHErGK-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wtU6qB\/upload_rHErGK-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wtU6qB\/upload_rHErGK-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wtU6qB\/upload_rHErGK-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-12 13:30:28","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:28:00","locations":[{"id":"Qfcr4y","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2900 Griffith St.","locality":"Charlotte","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"28203","phone":"704-372-3212","website":"http:\/\/www.triplecbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"MONDAY - closed \r\nTUESDAY 5 - 9 pm\r\nWEDNESDAY 5 - 9 pm\r\nTHURSDAY 5 - 9 pm\r\nFRIDAY 4 - 9 pm\r\nSATURDAY 2 - 9 pm\r\nSUNDAY 1 - 6 pm","latitude":35.200972,"longitude":-80.869119,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-12 13:32:27","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"cq7ZRj","name":"Smoked Apple Ale","nameDisplay":"Smoked Apple Ale","description":"The scents of late fall in a glass!

Because the brewer did not have the money to afford a new batch of malt, he was forced to use the smoked malt in his beer production. To his surprise, the townspeople loved the newly created beer; which in return became a new beer style in Germany. During the production of our smoked lager, we use a beechwood-smoked malt from a famous German malt house. This dark brown lager gives off a smoky and meat-like aroma. The complementary flavor follows the aroma characteristics with a balancing blend of smoke and malt along with a slight bitterness.","abv":"5.7","ibu":"19","srmId":16,"styleId":129,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-04-20 16:31:26","updateDate":"2015-04-20 16:31:26","srm":{"id":16,"name":"16","hex":"B54C00"},"style":{"id":129,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Smoke Beer (Lager or Ale)","shortName":"Smoke Beer","description":"Any style of beer can be smoked; the goal is to reach a balance between the style's character and the smoky properties.

In 1886 Adam Schumacher bought the brewery and started brewing beer. In 1906, the Potosi Brewing Company was founded by Adam and his brothers Nicholas and Henry. At its peak, the Potosi Brewery had grown to be the fifth largest in Wisconsin, shipping a variety of labels including Good Old Potosi, Holiday, Garten Brau, Augsburger and others to destinations throughout the United States. In 1972 the brewery ceased operations and closed its doors.\r\n\r\nThe restoration of the Potosi Brewery began in 1995 when Gary David bought the ruined Potosi Brewery Bottling buildings. This nearly one square block of buildings had just suffered a major fire and most of the buildings were a total loss. After working three years to rebuild parts of what had been destroyed, Gary then turned his attention to the Brewery itself. Being awarded the high bid at the county auction he then enlisted the help of his friend Rick Tobin and cousin Denis David. It was the marketing genius of Denis and his wife Madonna in 1999 that brought the public on board through a community meeting. This meeting was overwhelmingly attended by the public and brought forth numerous suggestions as well as additional support. It was this gathering of the public that led to the formation of the Potosi Brewery Foundation in February of 2000.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, with restoration underway, the Potosi Brewery Foundation was selected by the American Breweriana Association to be the home to its national museum. According to Len Chylack, president of the American Breweriana Association, Potosi was selected over cities such as Milwaukee and St. Louis because of their passion for beer, brewery history and beer-making culture.","website":"http:\/\/www.potosibrewery.com\/","established":"1852","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_ZDaYgp-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_ZDaYgp-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_ZDaYgp-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_ZDaYgp-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_ZDaYgp-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2016-06-24 17:44:52","locations":[{"id":"HeStKS","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"209 South Main Street","extendedAddress":"Box 177","locality":"Potosi","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"53820","phone":"608-763-4002","website":"http:\/\/www.potosibrewery.com\/","latitude":42.6716654,"longitude":-90.7271709,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1852","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"pO0ouy","name":"Triple Smoked Cubcrawler","nameDisplay":"Triple Smoked Cubcrawler","abv":"6","styleId":129,"isOrganic":"Y","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-07-14 21:31:31","updateDate":"2015-07-14 21:31:31","style":{"id":129,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Smoke Beer (Lager or Ale)","shortName":"Smoke Beer","description":"Any style of beer can be smoked; the goal is to reach a balance between the style's character and the smoky properties.

The wheat and barley is smoked at the brewery over oak for two hours prior to mashing.","abv":"4","ibu":"33","glasswareId":4,"srmId":3,"availableId":2,"styleId":129,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/FJBHl5\/upload_gPqfRD-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/FJBHl5\/upload_gPqfRD-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/FJBHl5\/upload_gPqfRD-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"An excellent accompaniment to brats, sausages, and need I add, kielbasa!","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:44:27","updateDate":"2015-12-16 08:20:10","glass":{"id":4,"name":"Pilsner","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"srm":{"id":3,"name":"3","hex":"FFCA5A"},"available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"style":{"id":129,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Smoke Beer (Lager or Ale)","shortName":"Smoke Beer","description":"Any style of beer can be smoked; the goal is to reach a balance between the style's character and the smoky properties.
