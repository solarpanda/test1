Previously known as the \u201cBib Corner\u201d, this location has an interesting historical past. Originally designed for the Peninsula restaurant, this three story structure was built by Nicholas Bauman in 1874.\r\n\r\nThis elegant restaurant gave way to the Franklin and Folz clothing store from 1884 to 1924. Through the years, the building housed a succession of businesses, including the Kalamazoo Stove company, a book bindery and a hotel.\r\n\r\nIt became the headquarters for W.R. Biggs\/Gilmore Agency in 1973. Severely damaged by the 1980 tornado, the building was completely rehabilitated in 1980-81.\r\n\r\nThe current owners, Marie and Stephen Blinn, wish to bring back a piece of history for all of Kalamazoo to enjoy. We are proud to offer to you the freshest beer available, brewed on-site in our 7-barrel brew house.","website":"http:\/\/oldepenkazoo.com\/","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/nyWnVf\/upload_dC1x7d-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/nyWnVf\/upload_dC1x7d-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/nyWnVf\/upload_dC1x7d-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/nyWnVf\/upload_dC1x7d-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/nyWnVf\/upload_dC1x7d-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:04","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:53:46","locations":[{"id":"fWfbGJ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"200 East Michigan Avenue","locality":"Kalamazoo","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49007","phone":"1-269-343-2739","website":"http:\/\/oldepenkazoo.com\/","latitude":42.2916515,"longitude":-85.5815665,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:04","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"rEL1SB","name":"Sunset Red","nameDisplay":"Sunset Red","styleId":32,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:44:20","updateDate":"2012-03-22 13:04:55","style":{"id":32,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Amber\/Red Ale","shortName":"Amber","description":"American amber\/red ales range from light copper to light brown in color.

There would be much to say and tell it to start back over the key dates. In 1986, Teo decides, with his partner then Michelle, a pretty young French dancer, to open in Piozzo, a small town unknown to the door of the Langhe where he was born, a \"creperie\"! He rents a former \"tavern\" with an attached mini apartment on the top floor and a gravel courtyard on the back and opens its doors. At first, his passion for beer, and a little 'light his aversion for wine led him to fill the menu with more than two hundred references international beers, as well as dainties to enjoy to work alongside the crepes. Gradually, the goodness of the choices made \u200b\u200bgood name and port customers to small local baptized \"Le Baladin\" by his friend Fran\u00e7ois of CIRQUE BIDON in homage to the nature of Teo same. Years went by and the room expands, you change, you will see a big circus tent to cover the courtyard paved with gravel now tables and chairs in style \"Oktoberfest\" and hand in hand also changes his mentor: Nora is now its new companion and muse together and decide a new course of the local : transform the creperie in a brewpub! After months of study and travel with Nora to discover Belgian brewers have our hero returns with huge bins loaded onto a van Volkswagen Westfalia and places them in the garage of the ousted former owner of the house, adjacent to the restaurant, now transformed into a microbrewery. So begins the adventure productive BEER BALADIN that sees just two beers \"taxes\" to the regulars who frequent the pub goers somewhat perplexed and embarrassed to taste these first, honestly a bit 'adventurous productions Teo. Over time, the production will be moved to other places for sizing issues and logistics, but still the aura of magic that permeated the early days of the brewery remains unchanged. Today, large kitchen has taken the place of the production and in the pub beers are on tap now classic carnet baladiniano as well as all production in the bottle. Occasionally a few small tweaks gives customers reason of surprise and veiled \"Amarcord\" in which one of them remembers the beginnings of this place, now a destination for \"pilgrimage\" by many fans of the beer world.

His dad informed him of a trademark he had won in 2004 and subsequently protected in contest from Anheuser Busch. The name was TailGate Beer.\r\n\r\nTim thought TailGate Beer was something special. As an avid sports fan and tailgater, Tim implored Wesley to take his homebrews that people loved drinking and brew TailGate Beer! Wesley, having put himself through college at San Diego State University, grew up modestly. The gift of TailGate Beer was a generous one but, unlike some tales of entrepreneurism, didn\u2019t come with startup funds.\r\n\r\nThey both agreed the name was solid and the marketing would one day be fun, but Wesley was emphatic that the beer had to be excellent. From there, Wesley took what he liked to brew, and brewed in Southern California. All initial beers were brewed and packaged in kegs and glass bottles. Wesley entered into the Great American Beer Festival in 2007 and although no formal awards were won, TailGate Beer was a hit! This drew lots of attention from beer fans from all over the country. The common response was \u201cgreat beer!\u201d and \u201cgreat name!\u201d So with confirmation of Wesley\u2019s biggest apprehension \u2013 people loved the beer \u2013 TailGate Beer was born.","website":"http:\/\/www.tailgatebeer.com\/","established":"2007","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/tailgatebeer.com\/tailgate-newsletter\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/PuOZUW\/upload_R7nvG9-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/PuOZUW\/upload_R7nvG9-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/PuOZUW\/upload_R7nvG9-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/PuOZUW\/upload_R7nvG9-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/PuOZUW\/upload_R7nvG9-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:59:49","locations":[{"id":"XqWTM7","name":"TailGate Beer","streetAddress":"7300 Charlotte Pike","locality":"Nashville","region":"Tennessee","postalCode":"37209","phone":"615-457-1424","website":"http:\/\/www.tailgatebeer.com","latitude":36.119999,"longitude":-86.919825,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2007","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2015-06-11 14:29:16","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Sw6b7F","name":"Tall Poppy","nameDisplay":"Tall Poppy","description":"This is an ale that is not afraid of standing tall among other great beers.

Scott and Michele changed the name to wholesale their beer throughout the United States.\r\n\r\nKevin continued on as Sequoia's Brewmaster, putting together a creative mix of 11 unique ales and lagers on tap brewed with the finest ingredients including monthly special beers, wines, specialty drinks, and their homemade Root Beer. Recently, Rick Bouke took over as Brewmaster, and is responsible for the high quality and craft beer character our customers have come to expect. Sequoia's menu offers great food with the freshest ingredients, serves Certified Angus Beef, prepares their sauces and items from scratch and offers fresh daily fish.\r\n\r\nSequoia offers a menu for all ages in a warm and comfortable atmosphere, where everyone knows your name. Sequoia is a hot spot for live music featuring the best local bands and a private party room. A second location with a mountain lodge atmosphere, rock fireplace and a patio was opened in Northeast Fresno in July of 2005 at Piazza del Fiore. Along with the same great beers on tap, there is a full bar at the Champlain location.","website":"http:\/\/www.sequoiabrewing.com\/","established":"2003","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:57:42","locations":[{"id":"WPIz5n","name":"Tower District","streetAddress":"777 East Olive Avenue","locality":"Fresno","region":"California","postalCode":"93728","phone":"559-264-5521","website":"http:\/\/www.sequoiabrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Wed 11am - 10pm\r\nThur 11am - 11pm\r\nFri - Sat 11am - Midnight\r\nSunday 10am - 10pm\r\n\r\nHAPPY HOUR\r\nMon - Fri 3pm - 6pm\r\nSat 1pm-4pm\r\nSun 10am - 12pm. 1pm - 4pm","latitude":36.758189,"longitude":-119.801674,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2003","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"HcnHXH","name":"North Fresno","streetAddress":"1188 E.

With the closing of the Stark Mill Brewery and the many changes that have befell the city in the recent years, Peter felt that Manchester, as New Hampshire's Queen City, was sadly falling the way of commercial and contract beers.

That early Web site helped generate positive press coverage and helped attract the investors needed to make the virtual brewery a real one. Muller said the idea was to make the Web site \u201cThis Old House meets the World Wide Web\u201d\u2014letting people go behind the taps and see the thousands of details needed to put a microbrewery together.\r\n\r\nHe also wanted to give beer lovers a chance, via their computers, to roll up their cyber-sleeves and help build the brewery. The site let beer lovers help select and name beers, design t-shirts and labels, volunteer to be a taste-tester and even apply for a job as a brewer. Visitors to the Web site can sign up for FlyingFishMail a monthly e-mail newsletter which now boasts more than 12,000 subscribers.\r\n\r\nMuller, who got into the brewing field to become a brewer, trained at Chicago's Siebel Institute of Technology, America's oldest brewing school. He quickly realized someone was going to have to run the day-to-day business of the brewery and now serves as President and Head Janitor (though not necessarily in that order).\r\n\r\nFlying Fish Brewing Company is located in Somerdale, New Jersey, approximately seven miles east of Philadelphia. In a state that once boasted 50 breweries, it is the first microbrewery in Southern New Jersey and the first new brewery built in that part of the state in more than half a century. From its opening in late 1996, Flying Fish has tripled its capacity and become the largest of the approximately 20 craft breweries in the state.","website":"http:\/\/www.flyingfish.com\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/M5zcKb\/upload_itowqN-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/M5zcKb\/upload_itowqN-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/M5zcKb\/upload_itowqN-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/M5zcKb\/upload_itowqN-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/M5zcKb\/upload_itowqN-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:46:07","locations":[{"id":"qjZIZq","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"900 Kennedy Boulevard","locality":"Somerdale","region":"New Jersey","postalCode":"08083","phone":"856-504-3442","website":"http:\/\/www.flyingfish.com\/","latitude":39.853834,"longitude":-75.019803,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"ZP79OI","name":"TerreFerme","nameDisplay":"TerreFerme","description":"TerreFerme the beer is well built that takes you on trails houblonn\u00e9s sprinkled rich floral aroma and bitterness both strong and delicate.

In five years, the brewery has more than doubled its brewing capacity - from 2,000 barrels per year to over 5,000 barrels per year and has won fifteen nationally-recognized awards, including a Bronze Medal at the 2008 World Beer Cup for Bucking Bock and 2009 National Grand Champion from the United States Beer Tasting Championships for Iron Thistle.","website":"http:\/\/www.rahrbrewery.com\/","established":"2004","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/WCBdy2\/upload_ixkkW0-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/WCBdy2\/upload_ixkkW0-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/WCBdy2\/upload_ixkkW0-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/WCBdy2\/upload_ixkkW0-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/WCBdy2\/upload_ixkkW0-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:55:35","locations":[{"id":"X6U0o8","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"701 Galveston Avenue","locality":"Fort Worth","region":"Texas","postalCode":"76104","phone":"817-810-9266","website":"http:\/\/www.rahrbrewery.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Wed:5:00 pm - 7:30 pm\r\nSat:1:00 pm - 3:00 pm","latitude":32.7368128,"longitude":-97.3275585,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2004","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2014-10-29 16:04:43","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"IOh22G","name":"Thanksgiving Ale","nameDisplay":"Thanksgiving Ale","description":"A traditional amber ale recipe, this beer has an addition of pumpkin and yam added to the mash.

Although no longer the largest brewery in the world, it is still the largest brewer of stout in the world. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the brewery owned most of the buildings in the surrounding area, including many streets of housing for brewery employees, and offices associated with the brewery. The brewery also made all of its own power using its own power plant.\r\n\r\nThere is an attached exhibition on the 250-year-old history of Guinness, called the Guinness Storehouse.","website":"http:\/\/www.guinness.com\/","established":"1759","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/HaPdSL\/upload_b3rzyZ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/HaPdSL\/upload_b3rzyZ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/HaPdSL\/upload_b3rzyZ-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/HaPdSL\/upload_b3rzyZ-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/HaPdSL\/upload_b3rzyZ-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:38:48","locations":[{"id":"9RsQkk","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"109 James's Street","locality":"Dublin City","region":"Dublin","postalCode":"8","website":"http:\/\/www.guinness.com\/","latitude":53.34309,"longitude":-6.290799,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"IE","yearOpened":"1759","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"IE","name":"IRELAND","displayName":"Ireland","isoThree":"IRL","numberCode":372,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"hQSqTr","name":"The Anonymous Amber","nameDisplay":"The Anonymous Amber","description":"Dry hopped to give the malty backbone a crispy counterpart for balance!","styleId":32,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-10 19:10:02","updateDate":"2015-02-10 19:10:02","style":{"id":32,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Amber\/Red Ale","shortName":"Amber","description":"American amber\/red ales range from light copper to light brown in color.

When he wasn\u2019t busy handcrafting smoked summer sausage and pepperoni at the deli he was handcrafting small batches of beer.  Dick built from scratch a three barrel brew house (which we still use today as our pilot system) to start designing and creating recipes in the back of the deli. The beer was so popular among Dick\u2019s friends that he soon found himself exceeding the annual production limit for homebrewers.  In 1992 Dick decided to make his hobby a business and started the application and permit process to create Dick\u2019s Brewing Company.  After two years and many batches brewed, and many beers drank, Dick\u2019s Brewing Company became a reality.\r\n\r\nDick quickly realized he would need more space for his growing passion and built a 2,100 square foot building adjacent to the deli.  He started with the three barrel system and would brew once a week yielding 6 kegs.  Initially he focused solely on three beers: Pale, Porter and Dick Danger.  Dick Danger Ale, is still our best selling beer to date.  When asked why he started the brewery Dick always answered, and I quote, \u201cI started brewing beer for one reason, I was thirsty\u201d.   And we are all so grateful he was.\r\n\r\nThe brewery was located behind the Deli on Prather Road from 1995 to 2008.  Over those 13 years the brewery grew from 200 bbls in sales in one state to over 3000 bbls in 6 states.   New uni tanks and bright tanks were added along with a brand new bottling line to keep up with demand, and Dicks creative passion for brewing also grew, starting with three recipes in 1994 to over twenty different styles in 2009.  Life was good and  Dick\u2019s Beers were flying out the door.\r\nIn 2006 Dick set his sights even higher, and he started construction on a new brewing facility. After two long years of work  we moved into the brand new 18000 square foot brewing facility on Galvin Road in Centralia.\r\n\r\nDick wore many hats and he was so many things to so many people.  In 2009 we lost a brewmaster, a friend, a dad, a partner, a son, a teacher, a rebel, an electrician, a plumber, a carpenter, a craftsman, a joker, a complete and unique leader.  He will always be remembered and by doing so his vision and his dream will forever live on in every bottle or keg that gets shipped from the warehouse to someone that is thirsty.\r\n\r\nToday, the Dick\u2019s Brew Crew is led by Dick\u2019s daughter, Julie Young.  With the new brewing facility producing 23 different styles and with plenty of room for growth, we feel that the sky is the limit when it comes to Dick\u2019s legacy.  All of us here at Dick\u2019s are proud to continue the dream that our founder started, and we are proud to have you all along for the ride.","website":"http:\/\/dicksbeer.com\/","established":"1984","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/GC3a1f\/upload_tiILgV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/GC3a1f\/upload_tiILgV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/GC3a1f\/upload_tiILgV-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/GC3a1f\/upload_tiILgV-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/GC3a1f\/upload_tiILgV-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:44:31","locations":[{"id":"TkT8Rc","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"5945 Prather Road","locality":"Centralia","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98531","phone":"800-586-7760","website":"http:\/\/dicksbeer.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Fridays 3pm - 7pm","latitude":46.771347,"longitude":-123.007543,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1984","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"7LZSG8","name":"The Detroit Dwarf","nameDisplay":"The Detroit Dwarf","description":"Copper\/amber in color.

Slight yeast haze is acceptable for bottle-conditioned products.","ibuMin":"30","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"4.5","abvMax":"6","srmMin":"11","srmMax":"18","ogMin":"1.048","fgMin":"1.012","fgMax":"1.018","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:26:52"},"breweries":[{"id":"DPLTAJ","name":"Terrapin Beer Company","nameShortDisplay":"Terrapin","description":"Terrapin Beer Company was born when two brewers met while working together at a microbrewery in Atlanta. Looking around at what other breweries in the SE were doing, Spike and John felt they could make a contribution. Realizing that anyone could make just another pale ale, brown ale or stout, Spike and John set their sights on crafting beers unlike any that were currently available in the SE.\r\n\r\nTerrapin introduced its first beer, the Rye Pale Ale in April of 2002. Six months later while only available on draft in Athens, Terrapin\u2019s sole offering won the American Pale Ale Gold Medal at the 2002 Great American Beer Festival.  Only six months old, Terrapin had arrived in style!","website":"http:\/\/www.terrapinbeer.com\/","established":"2002","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/DPLTAJ\/upload_02FSdj-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/DPLTAJ\/upload_02FSdj-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/DPLTAJ\/upload_02FSdj-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/DPLTAJ\/upload_02FSdj-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/DPLTAJ\/upload_02FSdj-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:59:59","locations":[{"id":"lA94r8","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"265 Newton Bridge Road","locality":"Athens","region":"Georgia","postalCode":"30606","phone":"888-557-2337","website":"http:\/\/www.terrapinbeer.com\/","latitude":33.9804178,"longitude":-83.3956826,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2002","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
