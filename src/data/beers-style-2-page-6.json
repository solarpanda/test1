The process of appreciation through education we call beer liberation.\r\n\r\nToday Short\u2019s Brewing Company continues the effort to educate and liberate consumers.  We take pride in our hands on, mom and pop approach and the energy we put into the quality of our beer, food, staff, customers and facilities. We believe in the power of the smallness.   We intend on remaining a smaller, state wide beer distributor and focusing our energies close to home (the SBC Michigan stimulus package).

With a lot of elbow grease, blind ambition and a little luck, the quest to create a community pub in Northwest Lower Michigan began to take shape.  The philosophy was to bring an appreciation of craft beer to the north with product education and creativity.  The process of appreciation through education we call beer liberation.\r\n\r\nToday Short\u2019s Brewing Company continues the effort to educate and liberate consumers.  We take pride in our hands on, mom and pop approach and the energy we put into the quality of our beer, food, staff, customers and facilities. We believe in the power of the smallness.   We intend on remaining a smaller, state wide beer distributor and focusing our energies close to home (the SBC Michigan stimulus package).  Our goal is to get to a comfortable production volume, enjoy what we do and love life in Northern Michigan.","website":"http:\/\/www.shortsbrewing.com\/","established":"2004","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2016-02-04 14:44:21","locations":[{"id":"CzopCY","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"121 North Bridge Street","locality":"Bellaire","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49615","phone":"231-533-6622","website":"http:\/\/www.shortsbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sun - Thu: 11:00 am \u2013 11:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:00 am - 12:00 am","latitude":44.976269,"longitude":-85.210357,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2004","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"YlwoAq","name":"The Haberdasher","nameDisplay":"The Haberdasher","description":"The Haberdasher is an English-style IPA, brewed with all English malts and all English hops.\r\n\r\nThe malt presence balances artfully with the earthy English hops, creating a drinkable beer that is unlike anything else that we brew.","abv":"5.4","availableId":2,"styleId":2,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/YlwoAq\/upload_vhqenS-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/YlwoAq\/upload_vhqenS-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/YlwoAq\/upload_vhqenS-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-09-11 18:22:06","updateDate":"2015-12-18 05:16:04","available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"style":{"id":2,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"English-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"English IPA","description":"Most traditional interpretations of English-style India pale ales are characterized by medium-high hop bitterness with a medium to medium-high alcohol content.

The saloon enjoyed a brisk business from the turn of the century until the advent of prohibition in 1920. The building, rich in history, is on the national registry of historic landmarks and has been restored to much of its original grandeur. Among the original architectural elements that remain today are the beautiful bar, intricate mosaic tile floor, much of the stained glass and of course the decorative ceiling. The luxurious back-bar won the coveted blue ribbon for craftsmanship at the 1893 World Columbian Exposition in Chicago.

Although Dominion has moved on, the Tuppers are back at it, brewing Tuppers\u2019 25K with us here at Lost Rhino. The name for this brew denotes a milestone: the Tuppers are approaching their 25,000th beer and to commemorate this incredible achievement we have helped them produce this wonderful ale. In addition to reaching this milestone, the Tuppers have also taken thorough notes through all their tasting sessions and will be compiling those notes into a book. Despite a starting gravity of 18.5\u00b0P (about 1.076) Tuppers\u2019 25K is an easy drinking beer. The hop additions bring citrus aromas and flavors with floral, herbal, and spice hints. Those flavors are paired with a malt bill that includes both Cararye (a malted rye that has undergone a preparation process similar to caramel\/crystal varieties of malted barley) and flaked rye, which together bring an additional spiciness to this ale.","abv":"7.9","ibu":"75","styleId":2,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-04 15:24:29","updateDate":"2014-09-07 17:31:13","style":{"id":2,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"English-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"English IPA","description":"Most traditional interpretations of English-style India pale ales are characterized by medium-high hop bitterness with a medium to medium-high alcohol content.

In 1978 they began taking formal tasting notes on each new beer they could find.\r\n\r\nBy the early 1990s the Tuppers had tasted and evaluated over 6,000 beers and visited hundreds of breweries.  They had found many excellent beers, but envisioned an ale that no one had made\u2014one that would encompass bold American flavors and traditional European brewing techniques.  They asked Old Dominion Brewing Co., which they felt was one of the very best craft breweries in the country, to work with them to develop this ideal ale.  Tuppers\u2019 Hop Pocket Ale was the result.  \r\n\r\nIn 1997 the Tuppers again worked with the Old Dominion brewers to create Tuppers\u2019 Hop Pocket Pils, based on the Keller or Hefe Pils style of Northern Bavaria, but with a unique American boldness to the flavor.\r\n\r\nThe Tuppers live in Bethesda, Maryland, where Bob teaches history.  Ellie works in Washington as a production editor of scientific books.  The Tuppers still travel and taste beers and now have notes on over 14,000 different brews.","website":"http:\/\/tuppersbeers.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/7JTum5\/upload_ROqFMo-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/7JTum5\/upload_ROqFMo-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/7JTum5\/upload_ROqFMo-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/7JTum5\/upload_ROqFMo-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/7JTum5\/upload_ROqFMo-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:01:15","locations":[{"id":"SsYPgS","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"6404 Redwing Road","locality":"Bethesda","region":"Maryland","postalCode":"20817","phone":"301-229-2027","website":"http:\/\/tuppersbeers.com\/","latitude":38.973459,"longitude":-77.127249,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"zK0nK8","name":"Lost Rhino Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Lost Rhino","description":"Lost Rhino\u2122 is a new craft brewery in Ashburn, VA with deep roots in Loudoun County.
