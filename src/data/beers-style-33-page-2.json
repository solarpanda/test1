After ending up on the wrong side of the tracks a few times, they were finally pointed in the direction of Virginia-Highlands and found a few bars willing to take a chance on them. \"We'll give you a shot as long as your dog stops begging for leftovers on our patio\" was the cautious approval they needed to get the brand rolling.\r\n\r\nSweetWater's second and current location is in Midtown Atlanta, adjacent to Ansley Park, in the Armour Circle Industrial Park just off of Piedmont and Monroe. The boys saved all of their pennies to buy the 25,000 square feet of brewing goodness and smack in the middle of all the action. Since the company began we've wanted to be closer to our homes, the bars and stores that sell our beer, and all the good folks that drink it. Fortunately seven years of great growth gave the company that opportunity. We learned a lot from that location and left all those mistakes behind as we built our new home. SweetWater Brewing Company has been here since 2004 and it feels good to be settled in. Our new home has enough capacity to brew 100,000 barrels of beer a year (A few more years at this rate.)","website":"http:\/\/www.sweetwaterbrew.com\/","established":"1997","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TMc6H2\/upload_3il9e7-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TMc6H2\/upload_3il9e7-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TMc6H2\/upload_3il9e7-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TMc6H2\/upload_3il9e7-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TMc6H2\/upload_3il9e7-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:59:40","locations":[{"id":"MfINpl","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"195 Ottley Drive","locality":"Atlanta","region":"Georgia","postalCode":"30324","phone":"404-691-2537","website":"http:\/\/www.sweetwaterbrew.com\/","latitude":33.808102,"longitude":-84.38119,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1997","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"zLPaD2","name":"Dawn of the Red","nameDisplay":"Dawn of the Red","description":"An IRA bursting with tropical notes, this beer finishes juicy with a subtle malty backbone.

We\u2019re at the foot of Lookout Mountain just steps away from the world-famous Incline Railway and very near to the great Moccasin Bend of the Tennessee River. \r\n\r\nMBBC was started by two brewers whose quest for the perfect beer led them to learn the art of brewing.  Chris Hunt and Duncan Guy began their brewing education in the Barley Mob Brewers homebrewing club and continued to search for unique and distinctive ale and lager formulas. They decided to offer their creations to the public through a small batch microbrewery in 2006.  Soon thereafter, award-winning brewer Courtney Tyvand joined the two and presented his smoked porter at the brewery\u2019s first beer dinner in October of 2006.\r\n\r\nThe brewery is located on the ground floor of a historic building at 4015 Tennessee Avenue in St. Elmo.  The building is constructed of foot-square cedar timbers and two-foot thick walls made of granite stone and mortar.  Built in 1911 as a packaging factory for K-Rations for WWI, we occasionally find artifacts from that era in the building walls and ceiling.  The brewery shares space with the Chattanooga U-Brew, a brew-on-premises business owned by Greg McCort. \r\n\r\nMBBC is proud to offer small batch specialty ales and lagers in kegs of various sizes.  A tasting room is part of the brewery; samples of our beers can be tasted and tested on premises.  Occasionally we have tasting events or tapping events at the brewery or at a nearby bar or restaurant.  Please check our calendar for scheduled tasting events at the brewery.","website":"http:\/\/www.bendbrewingbeer.com\/","established":"2006","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/zpGIxB\/upload_qc0XVO-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/zpGIxB\/upload_qc0XVO-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/zpGIxB\/upload_qc0XVO-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/zpGIxB\/upload_qc0XVO-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/zpGIxB\/upload_qc0XVO-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:02","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:09:53","locations":[{"id":"7MLLbj","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"4015 Tennessee Avenue","locality":"Chattanooga","region":"Tennessee","postalCode":"37409","phone":"423-821-6392","website":"http:\/\/www.bendbrewingbeer.com\/","latitude":35.007563,"longitude":-85.327766,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2006","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:02","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"pkT4Ce","name":"Deadhead Double Red Ale","nameDisplay":"Deadhead Double Red Ale","description":"Intense hop bitterness, flavor & aroma are balanced by high and notable alcohol content","abv":"10","ibu":"92","srmId":17,"availableId":2,"styleId":33,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/pkT4Ce\/upload_t4Pkg5-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/pkT4Ce\/upload_t4Pkg5-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/pkT4Ce\/upload_t4Pkg5-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","originalGravity":"1.089","createDate":"2013-11-06 21:08:43","updateDate":"2015-12-17 06:49:54","srm":{"id":17,"name":"17","hex":"B04500"},"available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"style":{"id":33,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Imperial Red Ale","shortName":"Imperial Red","description":"Imperial Red Ales are deep amber to dark copper\/reddish brown.

Let\u2019s start a craft beer brewery!\u201d  That Clarity in Thinking, led to the successful launch of Lucid Brewing.\r\n\r\nIn June of 2011, with a year of planning already completed, they realized jumping headfirst into the brewery was the only way they could make their dream a reality.  They quit their day jobs.  \r\n\r\nWith that leap of faith \u2013 and a ton of support from many friends and family \u2013 they started building their brewery from the ground up.  Through the sweltering heat of the 2011 summer, many friends labored side by side with Jon and Eric.  They did it all, start to finish, from digging trenches to assembling the last tank.  So of course they needed a refreshing and light drink to quench their thirst while they toiled away.  They found just the right recipe and brewed their first beer \u2013 AIR.  A beer made to get the job done.  Its slight citrus aroma and flavor, lower ABV and crisp dry finish made this their favorite \u201cgo to\u201d beer.  \r\n\r\nBy October the brewery was complete and cooking.  And in the spirit of the season, Eric and Jon gave thanks to the Brew gods when they made their first deliveries to their first three customers the week of Thanksgiving\u2026 in Jon\u2019s car.  Lucid was on its way!\r\n\r\nAlways keeping an eye on the demand for high quality while quickly catching the craft beer lover\u2019s attention, Lucid assembled a team of dedicated employees and introduced brews to quench their customers\u2019 demands.   AIR, DYNO, FOTO and DUO, along with seasonal and small-batch brews, are quickly becoming Minnesota favorites at local bars and restaurants.  \r\n\r\nGreat success has followed them after throwing away the daily grind for the daily brew.","website":"http:\/\/www.lucidbrewing.com\/","established":"2011","mailingListUrl":"www.LucidBrewing.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0cACKo\/upload_KCE6lg-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0cACKo\/upload_KCE6lg-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0cACKo\/upload_KCE6lg-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0cACKo\/upload_KCE6lg-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0cACKo\/upload_KCE6lg-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:01","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:22:32","locations":[{"id":"1xeovq","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"6020 Culligan Way","locality":"Minnetonka","region":"Minnesota","postalCode":"55345","phone":"612-810-9324","website":"http:\/\/lucidbrewing.wordpress.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Thu - Fri: 5:00 pm - 8:00 pm\r\nSat: 12:00 pm - 5:00 pm","latitude":44.895218,"longitude":-93.449725,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2009","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:01","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"7tiy63","name":"Due South Category 4 (Cat 4)","nameDisplay":"Due South Category 4 (Cat 4)","description":"The aroma you get from the Pacific North West hops only tell half the story of what you're about to experience in this red India pale ale.

Gordon is brewed with dash of chocolate malt in it, to round out its load of hops and balance the beer. The result is an assertive yet exceptionally smooth version of strong beer.\r\n\r\nWe brew Gordon in tribute to the late Gordon Knight. In addition to opening some of Colorado's first microbreweries, Knight was a Vietnam vet, grade-A citizen, and huge promoter of craft beer. He lost his life in 2002 while fighting a wild fire outside of Lyons, Colorado.\r\n\r\nOriginally our winter seasonal beer, it has become a cult favorite of extreme-beer lovers, so we now brew occasional batches of Gordon throughout the year. Released in bottles in 2003 and 2004, Gordon is now sold in four packs of hand-labeled cans and on draft in select markets.","abv":"8.7","ibu":"85","glasswareId":5,"availableId":1,"styleId":31,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/69R1Vd\/upload_Ze6ZJK-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/69R1Vd\/upload_Ze6ZJK-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/69R1Vd\/upload_Ze6ZJK-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:15","updateDate":"2016-02-10 17:26:20","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":31,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ale","shortName":"Imperial IPA","description":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma.

We will make everything from low gravity Sessions, to Regulars, Doubles, Triples and even a San Diego Pale Ale or two. We will make sure these styles are released, distributed, and tapped\u2026 FRESH!\r\n\r\nWe like big beers and we cannot lie! From the biggest Russian Imperial Stouts aged in spirit barrels to malty Double Reds, Smooth Porters, and velvety Wee Heavies, we just can\u2019t get enough of these complex beauties. Thick mouthfeel, high gravity, and rich flavors suitable for aging to be shared with family and friends. Crack one open to celebrate a special occasion, or just because its a Tuesday.\r\n\r\nMouth puckering sour ales is another style which we adore. One which we hoard, savor, and curse for not being more readily available. Using wine barrels from local Virginia Wineries we will age some carefully crafted super tart ales, blending them when needed and using fruits for character. Once the bugs catch up to our pipeline, expect a new sour to be released every month.\r\n\r\nAt Ocelot, we love two things\u2026 Beer and Music!\r\n\r\nWe believe in inspiration. It can come in many forms and varies from person to person. For us, music has always been our inspiration. Music has been the soundtrack to our lives and has in one way or another crafted every decision we\u2019ve made. We aim to create and dedicate our beers to the music that has inspired our journey through life.\r\n\r\nOcelot Brewing Company is a reflection of us, our styles, and our habits. From chasing freshies to cellaring whales and everything in between. We will craft many different beers in small batches. We brew beer we want to drink when we want to drink it. Come by and visit, listen to some tunes, grab a pint, fill a growler, and join us on this adventure.","website":"http:\/\/ocelotbrewing.com\/","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Qvbd2N\/upload_wfdHi6-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Qvbd2N\/upload_wfdHi6-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Qvbd2N\/upload_wfdHi6-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Qvbd2N\/upload_wfdHi6-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Qvbd2N\/upload_wfdHi6-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-12-12 17:31:01","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:49:14","locations":[{"id":"oPxIne","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"23600 Overland Drive","extendedAddress":"#180","locality":"Sterling","region":"Virginia","postalCode":"20166","phone":"(703) 474-3050","website":"http:\/\/ocelotbrewing.com","latitude":38.9629988,"longitude":-77.4992517,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-12-12 17:31:34","updateDate":"2016-03-22 17:54:38","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"VeyPwv","name":"Highstick","nameDisplay":"Highstick","description":"No penalties or fouls called on this \"High Stick\"!
