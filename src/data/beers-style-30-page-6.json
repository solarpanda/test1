For us, this is a passion, not a job. We believe that this comes through in the beers we make. Our beers have soul.\r\n\r\nWe brew several different beers; some are year round, some are seasonal and a few are single batch brews. They are available in bars, restaurants, grocery stores, liquor stores and warehouse stores throughout Texas and Louisiana.\r\n\r\nOur first keg of beer was shipped on June 9, 1994. Founded by Brock Wagner and Kevin Bartol, we chose Houston because, other than living here, this was the largest city in the country that did not have a microbrewery. Brock was a longtime homebrewer and had considered opening a brewery as far back as college, although that was quickly dismissed as a silly idea. Seven years after graduating, Brock revisited the idea, enlisted Kevin's help and the brewery was off and running. Kevin has since left the business after a bitter battle. (Just kidding - but don't you wish people wrote that when it was the truth?).\r\n\r\nPlease visit us if you are in Houston.

The horse of the dark nature holds the scales where the wheat and barley feedeth, not taketh from the mouths of man.

We set sail in December 2009, during the height of a global economic storm, and have quickly become one of the fastest growing breweries in Washington, with our beer is now sacking and pillaging cities throughout Washington and British Columbia. We have taken a different tack than many new brewers, and rather than going for a number of very big, single batch beers, we are focused on food-friendly beers in a smaller lineup that is readily available year round. We realized a long time ago that food-friendly by no means needs to be less flavorful, and we actually add ingredients to widen the palate of our beers above and beyond their original styles.\r\n\r\nTo better integrate with a meal and make our beers more \u2018sessionable\u2019 in general, we utilize highly attenuating yeasts to dry out our beers to make them less sweet and filling, then replace that desired sweetness with an addition outside the norm, such as Juniper, Ginger or even Angelica. These ingredients are always kept at a level to avoid building a \u2018spice beer\u2019, and always present themselves as a unique and complementary addition. We also focus on extremely clean finishes, and use the entire recipe to build bittering rather than just using the hops to reduce lingering starchiness.\r\n\r\nIn the end, the true beauty of any flavor is in the eye (and mouth) of the beholder. Read about our beers here, then taste them at your local restaurant or store and judge for yourself if we have truly crafted \u2018Great Beer Designed With Great Food In Mind\u2019.

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and\/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character.
