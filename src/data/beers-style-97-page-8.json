Sleeman arrived in Ontario from Cornwall, England. By 1851, he started the first Sleeman brewery to be located in Guelph, Ontario, brewing small 100-barrel batches. \r\n\r\nThe passion that drove John's great-great-grandfather to begin his renowned Canadian brewing tradition is the same passion that runs through John's veins today - and we look forward to passing on the tradition to many more generations to come.\r\n\r\nAn art as much as a science, beer making depends equally on the talent of the brewmaster and the quality of the ingredients. \r\n\r\nPremium brewing employs a time-honoured process in which natural ingredients are blended in myriad combinations and brewed in small batches to produce beers that range from contemporary light brews to 'Old World' dark stouts.","website":"http:\/\/www.sleeman.ca\/","established":"1851","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/D61TcY\/upload_y0NF7M-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/D61TcY\/upload_y0NF7M-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/D61TcY\/upload_y0NF7M-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/D61TcY\/upload_y0NF7M-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/D61TcY\/upload_y0NF7M-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:58:18","locations":[{"id":"q878Wn","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"551 Clair Road West","locality":"Guelph","region":"Ontario","phone":"1-519-822-1834","latitude":43.4870365,"longitude":-80.2067709,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"CA","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"CA","name":"CANADA","displayName":"Canada","isoThree":"CAN","numberCode":124,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"yPiQU2","name":"Original Ittinger Klosterbr\u00e4u","nameDisplay":"Original Ittinger Klosterbr\u00e4u","styleId":97,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:53","updateDate":"2013-11-09 12:37:56","style":{"id":97,"categoryId":8,"category":{"id":8,"name":"North American Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"American-Style Premium Lager","shortName":"American Premium Lager","description":"This style has low malt (and adjunct) sweetness, is medium bodied, and should contain no or a low percentage (less than 25%) of adjuncts.

The previous owner of the Pig's Eye brands, Minnesota Brewing Company, had gone out of business in June of that year.  We (two former Minnesota Brewing Company employees - Phil Gagne', the Brewmaster, and Jeff Crawford, the VP of Sales) formed Pig's Eye Brewing Company, and purchased the Pig's Eye brands from ... Minnesota Brewing company's creditors in September 2002. \r\n\r\nWith the old brewery closed, and  limited resources at our disposal, we applied for, and received, permission from the Bureau of Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau to brew as an \"alternating proprietor\" at City Brewing Company - La Crosse, WI; a brewery with a longstanding brewing heritage, and a commitment to quality.  As an \"alternating proprietor\", we are a \"brewery within a brewery\", essentially renting brewing and packaging equipment from City whenever we are brewing and packaging our products.\r\n\r\nOur inaugural brews of Pig's Eye Pilsner and Pig's Eye Light were started on February 18, 2003, with the 1st product run was on March 25, 2003.  To the chagrin of some of our loyal customers, we made the decision to drop the \"Pirate\" rendering of \"Pig's Eye\" from our packaging, in favor of a historically accurate portrayal of Pierre \"Pig's Eye\" Parrant.  In May 2004, in response to consumer interest in low-carb products, we replaced Pig's Eye Light with Pig's Eye Lean Light (the original Pig's Eye light beer).  Our product line expanded again in January 2006 - with the introduction of Pit Bull High Gravity Ice Malt Liquor, and again in June 2007 - with the re-introduction of Pig's Eye Ice.  We  also, for a short period of time, operated as an alternating proprietorship and packaged 24\/12 Returnable Bottles at Stevens Point Brewery- Stevens Point, WI, but had to discontinue the production of the returnable bottle package due to increases in packaging costs. \r\n\r\nWe started out in 2002 as a 2 man owner\/operator brewer, and remain so to this day.  Beer is our life, and our livelihood - We, and our families, appreciate your interest and support!","website":"http:\/\/www.pigseyebeer.com\/","established":"2002","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/JjzyTT\/upload_Vy65DU-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/JjzyTT\/upload_Vy65DU-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/JjzyTT\/upload_Vy65DU-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/JjzyTT\/upload_Vy65DU-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/JjzyTT\/upload_Vy65DU-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:05","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:08:34","locations":[{"id":"NkKRig","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"10107 Bridgewater Parkway","locality":"St. Paul","region":"Minnesota","postalCode":"55129","phone":"651-734-1661","website":"http:\/\/www.pigseyebeer.com\/","latitude":44.922333,"longitude":-92.901392,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2002","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:05","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"6W6Edk","name":"Pils","nameDisplay":"Pils","styleId":97,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:57","updateDate":"2012-03-22 13:04:50","style":{"id":97,"categoryId":8,"category":{"id":8,"name":"North American Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"American-Style Premium Lager","shortName":"American Premium Lager","description":"This style has low malt (and adjunct) sweetness, is medium bodied, and should contain no or a low percentage (less than 25%) of adjuncts.

Our intent is to encapsulate this muse exhibiting an artistic rendition to the best of our abilities.","website":"http:\/\/www.stillwaterales.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/UgR74t\/upload_0hjXOv-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/UgR74t\/upload_0hjXOv-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/UgR74t\/upload_0hjXOv-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/UgR74t\/upload_0hjXOv-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/UgR74t\/upload_0hjXOv-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:59:16","locations":[{"id":"AfUn8b","name":"Main Brewery","locality":"Baltimore","region":"Maryland","website":"http:\/\/www.stillwaterales.com\/","latitude":39.290585,"longitude":-76.609264,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"NFlggm","name":"Premium Draft Beer","nameDisplay":"Premium Draft Beer","abv":"5","styleId":97,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/NFlggm\/upload_WPJOlS-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/NFlggm\/upload_WPJOlS-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/NFlggm\/upload_WPJOlS-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-03 00:42:54","updateDate":"2015-12-17 02:45:32","style":{"id":97,"categoryId":8,"category":{"id":8,"name":"North American Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"American-Style Premium Lager","shortName":"American Premium Lager","description":"This style has low malt (and adjunct) sweetness, is medium bodied, and should contain no or a low percentage (less than 25%) of adjuncts.
