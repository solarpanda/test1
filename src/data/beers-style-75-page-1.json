It was initially offered on November 12, 1997. The brewing was later moved to the Sandlot Brewery at Coors Field. In February of 2012, Barmen production was moved back to AC Golden Brewing Company in order to make room for more Blue Moon innovations at the Sandlot Brewery.\r\n\r\nBarmen was born of Pete Coors\u2019 desire to brew a German Pilsner that tastes exactly like the great pilsners of northern Germany. The beer was named after Barmen, Germany; birthplace of Adolph Herman Joseph Coors. Barmen is offered in only a few bars and restaurants in and around Golden, CO.\r\n \r\nTo ensure you enjoy the full Barmen experience, bars and restaurants offering Barmen are requested to honor the traditional \u201cGerman Seven-Minute Pour\u201d and to serve the beer in the proper Barmen branded pilsner glass. When properly poured, it should look like this. Feel empowered to send the beer back to the bartender if it isn\u2019t served correctly.\r\n\r\nThis Pilsner pours a golden straw color, with a beautiful cap of fluffy white foam that creates a \u201clace\u201d on the sides of the glass as the beer is drank.\r\n\r\nTrue to the style, Barmen begins with toasty bread and biscuity flavors before being rounded out by the spicy and floral hop flavors that only the Noble varieties can provide. Full bodied for a Pilsner, the brew finishes clean and crisp with just the perfect level of carbonation.

This was the second business venture for Corcoran whom had been making award winning wines since 2004. Corcoran which is family owned and operated decided in 2011 to branch out into the hand crafted beer industry. Initially started in a barn on old farmland near Corcoran Vineyards, this combination became Virginia\u2019s first vineyard \/ brewery combo in the state. After several years of growing business it was realized that there was not enough room to stay as demand for the beer grew. In early 2014 the brewery was moved to Purcellville Virginia which is about 6 miles from where it started.\r\n\r\nCorcoran Brewing Company has produced over thirty three distinct beers since opening day. We strive to create both traditional beer types as well as creating unique experiences with experimental beers. On any given day we have twelve beers on tap ranging from Kolch style, American Pale Ales, IPA\u2019s, Imperial IPA\u2019s, Stouts, Bourbon barrel aged, port barrel aged and more. This daily broad selection of quality hand-made craft beers has been a primary reason for our success. Customers can always find a beer that meets their drinking style.","website":"http:\/\/www.corcoranbrewing.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Z7U3KK\/upload_DVPTNR-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Z7U3KK\/upload_DVPTNR-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Z7U3KK\/upload_DVPTNR-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Z7U3KK\/upload_DVPTNR-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Z7U3KK\/upload_DVPTNR-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:14:21","locations":[{"id":"G7WXOq","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"205 Hirst Rd, Suite 105","locality":"Purcellville","region":"Virginia","postalCode":"20132","phone":"540-441-3102","website":"http:\/\/www.corcoranbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Wed:  3:00pm - 9:00pm\r\nThu:  3:00am - 9:00pm\r\nFri:  12:00pm - 10:00pm\r\nSat:  12:00pm - 10:00pm\r\nSun:  12:00pm - 6:00pm","latitude":39.143536,"longitude":-77.712861,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2015-06-09 18:47:13","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"mT0W9Z","name":"Berliner Pilsner","nameDisplay":"Berliner Pilsner","description":"Berliner Pilsner a classic German Pilsener beer.","abv":"5","glasswareId":5,"srmId":3,"availableId":1,"styleId":75,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/mT0W9Z\/upload_gFlg5z-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/mT0W9Z\/upload_gFlg5z-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/mT0W9Z\/upload_gFlg5z-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:47","updateDate":"2015-12-16 08:47:19","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"srm":{"id":3,"name":"3","hex":"FFCA5A"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":75,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"German-Style Pilsener","shortName":"German Pilsener","description":"A classic German Pilsener is very light straw or golden in color and well hopped.

Krook's Mill, now the Manayunk Brewery and Restaurant, was one of the linchpins of the then booming industry. Anne Dawson opened the mill in 1822 at the mouth of the Manayunk Canal and the Krook family followed with the existing building just short of 100 years later in 1912. A cornerstone from the original mill was placed in the new building. Krook's Mill eventually closed its doors in 1992.\r\n\r\nFour years later, Harry Renner IV brought the facility back to life as a space for retail business, a fine eatery, a brewery and as an entertainment complex for both neighbors and visitors alike to enjoy. Our first batch of fresh-brewed beer was tapped on October 17, 1996. In 2000, we expanded our outdoor seating with a deck overlooking the Schuylkill River. In 2003, we added a Stone Pizza Oven and a Sushi Bar to expand our menu selection.
