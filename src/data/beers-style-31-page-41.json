Like many home brewers he eventually grew in knowledge and recipes and wanted to make more and different beers.\r\n\r\nHe landed that home brewers dream job at New Haven Brewing in 1992 cleaning kegs and packing cases. But his obvious passion for the brewing craft led him to the title assistant brewer and eventually head brewer in short three years. At that time he joined forces with former NHB colleague Blair Potts to run Quality Assured Brewing, a consulting service for microbreweries throughout the North East. 1996 saw Rob as the Brew Master for both the Manchester and Westport, CT locations in The John Harvard\u2019s Brew House chain. While there, Rob won a gold medal at the Great American Beer Festival in the German Altbier category. Southern Connecticut, especially Norwalk, took a liking to Rob and that was where he became the brewmaster and operations manager for New England Brewing. He learned the sales end of beer and when the owners wanted to get out of the brewery business, Rob immediately took the opportunity to acquire the name of the company and re-locate the whole business just down the street from the kitchen where he first started making beer.","website":"http:\/\/newenglandbrewing.com\/","established":"2001","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/rAHla4\/upload_W9hQ0C-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/rAHla4\/upload_W9hQ0C-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/rAHla4\/upload_W9hQ0C-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/rAHla4\/upload_W9hQ0C-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/rAHla4\/upload_W9hQ0C-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:03","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:04:29","locations":[{"id":"jzO9Iv","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"7 Selden St","locality":"Woodbridge","region":"Connecticut","postalCode":"06525","phone":"203-387-2222","website":"http:\/\/newenglandbrewing.com\/","latitude":41.3389393,"longitude":-72.9816961,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2001","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:03","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"p0O2HR","name":"Ziggy's Royal Stardust","nameDisplay":"Ziggy's Royal Stardust","abv":"9.8","styleId":31,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-01-25 15:40:04","updateDate":"2016-01-25 15:40:04","style":{"id":31,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ale","shortName":"Imperial IPA","description":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma.

Hop character should be fresh and lively and should not be harsh in quality. The use of large amounts of hops may cause a degree of appropriate hop haze. Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have medium-high to full body. Diacetyl should not be perceived. The intention of this style of beer is to exhibit the fresh and bright character of hops. Oxidative character and aged character should not be present.","ibuMin":"65","ibuMax":"100","abvMin":"7.5","abvMax":"10.5","srmMin":"5","srmMax":"13","ogMin":"1.075","fgMin":"1.012","fgMax":"1.02","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:26:46"},"breweries":[{"id":"rHCSHp","name":"515 Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"515","description":"Exceptional Folks Drink Exceptional Beer","website":"http:\/\/www.515brewing.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/rHCSHp\/upload_NLtM7U-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/rHCSHp\/upload_NLtM7U-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/rHCSHp\/upload_NLtM7U-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/rHCSHp\/upload_NLtM7U-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/rHCSHp\/upload_NLtM7U-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-10-23 13:38:07","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:38:18","locations":[{"id":"ir0rpe","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"7700 University Ave","locality":"Clive","region":"Iowa","postalCode":"50325","phone":"(515) 661-4615","website":"http:\/\/www.515brewing.com\/","latitude":41.5999157,"longitude":-93.7226797,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-10-23 13:39:07","updateDate":"2016-01-04 19:35:13","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
