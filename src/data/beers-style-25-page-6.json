Automatic is a modern pale ale with an ABV of 5.2-\u00ad\u2010percent that features a prominent hop flavor and aroma. The beer appears hazy and straw colored with densely packed and persistent white foam. A mix of Mosaic and Crystal hops are used to create a delicate balance and give the beer an aroma that features a complex array of berry, citrus, herbal and pine notes.\r\n\r\n\u201cAutomatic is meant to be light, refreshing and quite drinkable without falling into the common pitfall of ending up too thin, watery or insipid. No color malts were used, however, the relatively full mouthfeel is enough to support this heavily hopped beer,\u201d says Co-\u00adFounder and Brewmaster Adam Beauchamp. \u201cThe flavor mirrors the aroma with a bit more earthiness and stone fruit, leading to a nicely balanced and moderately bitter finish.\u201d\r\n\r\nOnce again, we collaborated with a local artist to design the can label. Athens\u2019 painter, Michelle Fontaine was inspired by 1950s American popular culture as well as the origin of our facility \u2013 a former 1940s Chevy dealership and later the Snow Tire Company.

The first piece of the puzzle was David Stein who at the time was the head brewer at Twain's Billiards & Tap, a well-known brewpub in Decatur, GA.   David was a home brewer turned pro, whose passion for craft beer had moved him through working at some of the top craft beer establishments.  David was using the name Creature Comforts for his personal home brews and that name became the foundation for the brewery we run today.  David quickly brought on his friend Adam Beauchamp, who was in his seventh year of brewing beer at Sweetwater Brewing Company in Atlanta, GA, a brewery he began working at after leaving a PHD in Genetics program at Emory.  Adam himself was an accomplished home-brewer and he had a wealth of experience running a production brewery.                   \r\n\r\nWith the help of a craft beer enthusiast and local Athens, GA businessman, Derek Imes, we began building Creature Comforts in a beautiful 13,000 square foot historic warehouse building in downtown Athens.  The building was originally built in the 1940's as a Chevy dealership and later became Snow Tire Co., before Creature Comforts took over.  Building in a 1940's warehouse presented a lot of challenges as well as many wonderful opportunities.  One such opportunity was the chance to salvage and reclaim the old wood from the building that was subsequently refinished and then put back into the brewery in the form of bar tops, tables, wall paneling, and ceilings.  The final result, is a brewery that has won an award for outstanding rehabilitation by the Athens Heritage Foundation and something that we are extremely proud to share with the world.\r\n\r\nApproximately two months before opening, we found the final missing piece.  We knew we wanted to bring someone into the family who would handle the business aspects of the brewery, considering the fact that Adam and David are brewers dedicated to spending every minute of their day making the best possible beer.  Through a long journey that ended with a very serendipitous introduction that came via a person in Vancouver, British Columbia, Chris Herron, a Georgia native himself who was living in Connecticut, became the CEO of Creature Comforts.  Chris had spent 12 years working in sales, pricing, and finance for major beverage alcohol suppliers, and was intent on starting a craft brewery in Georgia, which made him joining Creature Comforts an easy choice.   We have since added, Blake Tyers a veteran and forward thinking home brewer as a brewer at Creature Comforts, and we brought on Katie Beauchamp to manage our office activities, tours and special events.  Combined with the nearly 20 part time tour staff we have, our entire family is together and we have  20+ years of experience.\r\n\r\nWhat started out as curious exploration of what we love, turned into us uncovering our passion, following that passion, and finding happiness, which has allowed us to enjoy the Creature Comforts of life.   Creature Comforts Brewing Company is truly our very own creature comfort.  Our brewery is what makes us happy, it is what makes us feel at home, it is what comforts us, and puts us in a happy place.  Creature Comforts is the end result of the story of our past and the starting point for the story our future, and we look forward to writing that story with you.","website":"http:\/\/www.creaturecomfortsbeer.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/POBUM3\/upload_oQan0u-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/POBUM3\/upload_oQan0u-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/POBUM3\/upload_oQan0u-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/POBUM3\/upload_oQan0u-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/POBUM3\/upload_oQan0u-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-11-07 00:01:58","updateDate":"2016-06-13 13:52:05","locations":[{"id":"r9KC4e","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"271 W.

From the explorers of the 1700s through the Gold Rush, many a thirsty Alaskan has been able to enjoy locally made beers.\r\n\r\nIn 1986, 28-year-olds Marcy and Geoff Larson reignited that tradition when they opened the Alaskan Brewing Company, the 67th brewery in the country and the first brewery in Juneau since Prohibition. Alaskan beers reflect many of the same characteristics of beers that were brewed here during the gold rush era. From the historically based Alaskan Amber recipe to alder-smoked malts and Sitka spruce tips, Alaskan beers reflect Juneau's local brewing history and innovation.\r\n\r\nMarcy and Geoff were drawn to the beauty and adventure of Alaska, but finding a livelihood that would allow them to stay was a challenge. \"Why not start a brewery?\" a friend suggested. Other than the extreme financial and logistical challenges of brewing beer in the Last Frontier, they couldn't think of why not.\r\n\r\nMaybe the idea wasn't so far-fetched. After all, Geoff was a chemical engineer and a homebrewer and was married to Marcy, an adventure-seeking accountant and aspiring bush pilot. Together they brought a unique skill set to the task of opening a brewery in Alaska.\r\n\r\nWhile researching brewing in Alaska, Marcy unearthed shipping records from Douglas City Brewing Co. (1899-1907) that listed ingredients for its popular beers and a newspaper article that described the way it was brewed. Geoff homebrewed a batch of the Gold Rush-era brew and they could see what made it so popular. That beer is now known as Alaskan Amber.\r\n\r\nIn December 1986, Alaskan Brewing Co. officially began operations when Geoff, Marcy and 10 volunteers spent 12 hours hand packaging the first 253 cases of Alaskan Amber for distribution in Juneau, Alaska. From that very humble beginning, Alaskan Brewing Co. has grown to become the most award-winning craft brewery in the history of the Great American Beer Festival and expanded distribution to 14 states.","website":"http:\/\/www.alaskanbeer.com","established":"1986","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/VPHkaP\/upload_psVrqV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/VPHkaP\/upload_psVrqV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/VPHkaP\/upload_psVrqV-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/VPHkaP\/upload_psVrqV-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/VPHkaP\/upload_psVrqV-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:43","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:38:23","locations":[{"id":"krIs45","name":"Main Location","streetAddress":"5429 Shaune Dr","locality":"Juneau","region":"Alaska","postalCode":"99801-9540","phone":"907-780-5866","website":"http:\/\/www.alaskanbeer.com\/","latitude":58.3570171,"longitude":-134.4893459,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1986","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:43","updateDate":"2015-12-03 19:08:04","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"h5hUfy","name":"Azacca Spring Ale","nameDisplay":"Azacca Spring Ale","abv":"5.5","ibu":"38","srmId":9,"availableId":5,"styleId":25,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","servingTemperature":"cold","servingTemperatureDisplay":"Cold - (4-7C\/39-45F)","originalGravity":"1.052","createDate":"2015-06-11 14:49:32","updateDate":"2015-06-11 14:50:48","srm":{"id":9,"name":"9","hex":"E58500"},"available":{"id":5,"name":"Spring","description":"Available during the spring months."},"style":{"id":25,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"American Pale","description":"American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.

One or more of these hop characters is the perceived end, but the perceived hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. American pale ales have medium body and low to medium maltiness. Low caramel character is allowable. Fruity-ester flavor and aroma should be moderate to strong. Diacetyl should be absent or present at very low levels. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.","ibuMin":"30","ibuMax":"42","abvMin":"4.5","abvMax":"5.6","srmMin":"6","srmMax":"14","ogMin":"1.044","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.014","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:25:18"},"breweries":[{"id":"Zk82Pq","name":"Cedar Creek Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Cedar Creek","description":"Cedar Creek Brewery started as an idea in October 2010 and has become a reality in 2012. Session beers are our passion and we really want that to be the focus of the brewery. Don\u2019t get us wrong we really love those huge hop and malt bombs and will be releasing them as part of our seasonal and specialty lineup but having a few while enjoying the company of friends is the way we love to drink beer. So keeping our beers drinkable and with enough creativity that you want to keep coming back for more is our goal.","website":"http:\/\/www.cedarcreekbrewery.com\/","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Zk82Pq\/upload_SzMZ9R-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Zk82Pq\/upload_SzMZ9R-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Zk82Pq\/upload_SzMZ9R-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Zk82Pq\/upload_SzMZ9R-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Zk82Pq\/upload_SzMZ9R-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:50","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:16:38","locations":[{"id":"H81Yew","name":"Main Brewery & Taproom","streetAddress":"336 E.
