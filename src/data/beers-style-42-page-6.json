Not this time around.\r\n \r\nA brewer slowly climbed from the lowest points of business life with a sore ass, as he ascended to a new level. Hark! The horse of the dark nature holds the scales where the wheat and barley feedeth, not taketh from the mouths of man. A non-filtered view of hard work, careful perseverance of expansion, sticking to what is believed to be the right way and the only way to stay true to high quality, and also, the vague understandings of possible humor; blurring his family\u2019s, employees\u2019 and customers\u2019 drinking experience and vision between a no-bullshit approach to brewing big, outstanding beers and selling nonsensical imagery and haberdashery\u2026Proven to the masses as a Darkhorse trademark for the man behind the reigns.\r\n \r\nCan true patrons of quality, time and devotion deal with the inner workings of a mad-man\u2019s psyche as he speaks of visions of smacking Umpa Lumpas with snow shovels, or allows the obscure drawings of lawn jarts and tinker toys to be hung on the walls of his establishment? They seem to\u2026A madman\u2019s passion for brewing comes out in strange ways indeed; where his employees and fellow brew house boys may know not how to deal with his tongue twisted ramblings and contortions of the face at first; where the same can definitely scare away newcomers.\r\n \r\nTrue patrons know how to accept the obscure humor. Some have lent a hand in some way or another. They know what \u201cpour to the line\u201d means; they have been to every annual crawfish boil and some find the passion within themselves to put the Darkhorse name to skin\u2026still they barely understand the immature drawings created in the brewery\u2026 True patrons know the hard work the brewers put in to create and keep the Darkhorse name in the lead.\r\n \r\nSome things in life are easily read and some things keep you guessing. Should we take turns consuming garage sale items and vomiting them on the walls or should we follow the square, straight and narrow? Slip into the pub and look around. Go out and buy a six-pack, and read the holder the beer comes in. Read the back of your growler. When you\u2019re done, you\u2019ll either get it or you won\u2019t. No matter, as you\u2019re drinking some of the best fuckin\u2019 beer made in the great state of Michigan.

The common thread that binds all of Penn\u2019s beers together, however, is exceptional quality and craftsmanship.

We employ double-decoction grain mashing to release fuller flavor in our lagers.  And we lager all of our beers in horizontal tanks for a cleaner, crisper finish. \r\n\r\nPenn Brewery is housed in the mid-nineteenth century landmark E&O Brewery building and is one of only a handful of working breweries with original beer caves still on premise.

In 2003 Skip and Phin purchased the defunct Old Saddle Back Brewing Co. in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. All the equipment was removed and brought back to Lakewood, New York and set up at its new 10,000 square foot home, The Southern Tier Brewing Company. The Brewery began operations in February 2004 distributing regionally. By 2005 sales covered the majority of the New York State and the eastern half of Pennsylvania. In the beginning their two Flagship brands were a Pilsner and Mild Ale. Oh yeah they also brewed IPA! As it turned out the flagships were a flop and the IPA was a huge success. They next launched a line of seasonal beers which have gained great success. Since the beginning, Southern Tier has experienced steady growth, currently distributing to over 25% of the United States. Multiple expansions have been made to keep up with demand and the brewery continues to be innovative by producing new products.

We miss 'em too, but we proved it's real hard to put the big hamburger chains out of business.

We sold our Bremerton location and remodeled the Silverdale location into what it is today.\r\n\r\nWe operate today on the same principles as we did when we opened our first Top Notch Burger.

As businesses continue to evolve and change in Raleigh, we wanted to bring that feeling to the local restaurant scene by offering items that no one else does.  The self-serve beer wall, The Downpour, allow patrons to sample, select, and pour their own beer.  We are importing beers from both Europe and across America to supplement our soon to be released beer line.  A collaborative effort of Matt MacNeil and Adam Hoffman, the goals of the company are simple: Great Beer, Great Food, and Great Service.\r\n\r\nLocated in the Historic CP&L Garage, the space has been renovated to bring back the industrial feel that the Powerhouse Square District deserves.  With garage doors that connect the patio to the restaurant, exposed columns, and I-beams, as well as a custom concrete bar with reclaimed wood accents, we\u2019ve blended the modern with the historic.  The industrial atmosphere has been infused with technology wherever possible. Wi-Fi tablets for tableside service, LED lighting, and of course The Downpour (our self-serve beer wall), all come together to create a space that feels both raw and unfinished, yet modern and  functional.  Come enjoy a drink with friends, cheer your favorite team to victory, or host a company event.\r\n\r\nA bar and restaurant focused on craft beer, Clouds Brewing is home to The Downpour; using RFID technology you can start a tab and pour your own beer. And the best part is you pay by the ounce, not by the pint! Feel free to try a small taste of each beer, or a pint of your favorite\u2014the choice is yours. With 10 rotating taps there is always something new to try, and with no need to buy whole pints, you can try them all! So seriously, come on down, grab a glass, and \u201cExperience the Downpour!\u201d\r\n\r\nOur bar features 40 beers on draft with 10 of those located on The Downpour.  We also offer a large selection of canned and bottled beer, ciders and mead, along with wine and liquor.","website":"http:\/\/www.cloudsbrewing.com","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/B5jTO7\/upload_cjWIhN-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/B5jTO7\/upload_cjWIhN-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/B5jTO7\/upload_cjWIhN-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/B5jTO7\/upload_cjWIhN-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/B5jTO7\/upload_cjWIhN-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-06 13:38:27","updateDate":"2016-03-17 14:20:24","locations":[{"id":"c2Ifvu","name":"Main Brewpub","streetAddress":"126 N.

Brothers Jason and Tom Sobocinski come from a Polish\/Italian family where food and drink is always the focus of every gathering. From Jason\u2019s wedding to his son\u2019s birthdays, roasting a pig has become the favorite way to celebrate any special occasion. Tyler Jones, an old family friend and former brewer of The Portsmouth Brewery in New Hampshire, contacted Jason and Tom with a plan to move to New Haven so his wife and son could be closer to their family. With a plan in the works to form a brewery that would celebrate family and food, they needed to encompass all that they were passionate about. When they celebrate, they roast a hog and the Berkshire hog is the breed of choice, thus Black Hog brewing was born! \r\n\r\nBlack Hog Brewing (BHB) will have a strong tie to local agriculture with a focus on unique craft brews that are pleasant to drink and pair well with foods of all types. Black Hog Brewing will craft year round and seasonal brews with a seasonal Farm Land Series dedicating a percentage of proceeds to support CT Farm Land. 3-4 pig roasts per year, using CT raised Berkshire pigs fed our spent brewing grains will celebrate the release of our seasonal brews. We hope you\u2019ll enjoy Black Hog Brewing Company at one of our pig roasts soon or whatever occasion brings you together for great beer and food with friends and family.","website":"http:\/\/www.blackhogbrewing.com","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/WgTa5f\/upload_KnhGJu-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/WgTa5f\/upload_KnhGJu-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/WgTa5f\/upload_KnhGJu-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/WgTa5f\/upload_KnhGJu-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/WgTa5f\/upload_KnhGJu-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-08-24 01:04:56","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:57:58","locations":[{"id":"LoZU74","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"115 Hurley Rd","extendedAddress":"Bldg 9A","locality":"Oxford","region":"Connecticut","postalCode":"06478","website":"http:\/\/www.blackhogbrewing.com","latitude":41.4757707,"longitude":-73.1520822,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-08-24 01:04:56","updateDate":"2014-08-25 11:53:08","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Lp0hUY","name":"Coffee Stout","nameDisplay":"Coffee Stout","abv":"6","styleId":42,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-10-23 04:10:27","updateDate":"2014-10-28 13:44:00","style":{"id":42,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Stout","shortName":"American Stout","description":"Initial low to medium malt sweetness with a degree of caramel, chocolate and\/or roasted coffee flavor with a distinctive dryroasted bitterness in the finish.
