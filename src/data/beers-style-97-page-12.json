Previously known as the \u201cBib Corner\u201d, this location has an interesting historical past. Originally designed for the Peninsula restaurant, this three story structure was built by Nicholas Bauman in 1874.\r\n\r\nThis elegant restaurant gave way to the Franklin and Folz clothing store from 1884 to 1924. Through the years, the building housed a succession of businesses, including the Kalamazoo Stove company, a book bindery and a hotel.\r\n\r\nIt became the headquarters for W.R. Biggs\/Gilmore Agency in 1973. Severely damaged by the 1980 tornado, the building was completely rehabilitated in 1980-81.\r\n\r\nThe current owners, Marie and Stephen Blinn, wish to bring back a piece of history for all of Kalamazoo to enjoy.
