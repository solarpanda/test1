In 2003 Skip and Phin purchased the defunct Old Saddle Back Brewing Co. in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. All the equipment was removed and brought back to Lakewood, New York and set up at its new 10,000 square foot home, The Southern Tier Brewing Company. The Brewery began operations in February 2004 distributing regionally. By 2005 sales covered the majority of the New York State and the eastern half of Pennsylvania. In the beginning their two Flagship brands were a Pilsner and Mild Ale. Oh yeah they also brewed IPA! As it turned out the flagships were a flop and the IPA was a huge success. They next launched a line of seasonal beers which have gained great success. Since the beginning, Southern Tier has experienced steady growth, currently distributing to over 25% of the United States. Multiple expansions have been made to keep up with demand and the brewery continues to be innovative by producing new products.  Keep a look out for new products coming to stores near you.","website":"http:\/\/www.southerntierbrewing.com\/","established":"2002","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/x8kqVp\/upload_4gTXFP-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/x8kqVp\/upload_4gTXFP-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/x8kqVp\/upload_4gTXFP-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/x8kqVp\/upload_4gTXFP-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/x8kqVp\/upload_4gTXFP-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:58:38","locations":[{"id":"nUT6v5","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2072 Stoneman Circle","locality":"Lakewood","region":"New York","postalCode":"14750","phone":"716-763-5479","website":"http:\/\/www.southerntierbrewing.com\/","latitude":42.1008305,"longitude":-79.3356897,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2002","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2014-10-27 14:23:02","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"kQJa9a","name":"Native Son","nameDisplay":"Native Son","styleId":125,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/kQJa9a\/upload_lXkQeL-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/kQJa9a\/upload_lXkQeL-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/kQJa9a\/upload_lXkQeL-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-09-01 13:45:00","updateDate":"2015-12-17 05:54:51","style":{"id":125,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Specialty Beer","shortName":"Specialty","description":"These beers are brewed using unusual fermentable sugars, grains and starches that contribute to alcohol content other than, or in addition to, malted barley.

Muller said the idea was to make the Web site \u201cThis Old House meets the World Wide Web\u201d\u2014letting people go behind the taps and see the thousands of details needed to put a microbrewery together.\r\n\r\nHe also wanted to give beer lovers a chance, via their computers, to roll up their cyber-sleeves and help build the brewery. The site let beer lovers help select and name beers, design t-shirts and labels, volunteer to be a taste-tester and even apply for a job as a brewer. Visitors to the Web site can sign up for FlyingFishMail a monthly e-mail newsletter which now boasts more than 12,000 subscribers.\r\n\r\nMuller, who got into the brewing field to become a brewer, trained at Chicago's Siebel Institute of Technology, America's oldest brewing school.

The original brewery was built by Nick and Simon in a run down warehouse located in Hammond, Indiana. The first beers brewed by the brothers were designed to be a departure from the fairly bleak craft brewing scene in the region. Nick and Simon brewed intense balanced beers that were and still remain \u201cnot normal\u201d by conventional standards.\r\n\r\nIn November of 2005, after receiving numerous visitors to the brewery over the years, Three Floyds opened its own brewpub at the production facility. What was once office space is now a refuge for the craft beer enthusiast. With all the Three Floyds mainstays, seasonal offerings, special small batch beers and many guest beers it is a mecca for craft beer. The pub also has a full service kitchen providing pub fare of the best quality supported by a 3000 square foot organic herb and vegetable garden.","website":"http:\/\/www.3floyds.com","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/iodDki\/upload_Va4zor-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/iodDki\/upload_Va4zor-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/iodDki\/upload_Va4zor-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/iodDki\/upload_Va4zor-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/iodDki\/upload_Va4zor-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2016-07-29 12:02:44","locations":[{"id":"71LkGn","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"9750 Indiana Parkway","locality":"Munster","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"46321","phone":"1-219-922-3565","website":"http:\/\/www.threefloydspub.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nTue:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nWed:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nThu:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nFri:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nSat:  12:00pm - 2:00am\r\nSun:  12:00pm - 12:00am","latitude":41.535541,"longitude":-87.516686,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2015-06-18 14:42:36","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"GoDmMT","name":"Munster","streetAddress":"9750 Indiana Parkway","locality":"Munster","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"46321","phone":"219-922-4425","website":"http:\/\/www.3floyds.com\/","latitude":41.535536,"longitude":-87.516687,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:16","updateDate":"2015-04-01 18:55:51","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"6DQQJu","name":"Oatmeal Cream Pie Ale - Big Debbrah Series","nameDisplay":"Oatmeal Cream Pie Ale - Big Debbrah Series","abv":"8","styleId":125,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/6DQQJu\/upload_wdQaH3-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/6DQQJu\/upload_wdQaH3-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/6DQQJu\/upload_wdQaH3-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-10-30 19:40:12","updateDate":"2016-01-18 18:08:43","style":{"id":125,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Specialty Beer","shortName":"Specialty","description":"These beers are brewed using unusual fermentable sugars, grains and starches that contribute to alcohol content other than, or in addition to, malted barley.

It is typical for us to offer over twenty different Elysian beers between the three locations.","website":"http:\/\/www.elysianbrewing.com\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/hvWfx5\/upload_Ml4tjJ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/hvWfx5\/upload_Ml4tjJ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/hvWfx5\/upload_Ml4tjJ-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/hvWfx5\/upload_Ml4tjJ-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/hvWfx5\/upload_Ml4tjJ-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:07:42","locations":[{"id":"QbZbCr","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1221 East Pike Street","locality":"Seattle","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98122","phone":"206-860-3977","website":"http:\/\/www.elysianbrewing.com\/","latitude":47.614033,"longitude":-122.315716,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"7S4DH1","name":"TangleTown","streetAddress":"2106 N 55th St, Seattle, WA 98103","locality":"Seattle","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98103","phone":"206-547-5929","website":"http:\/\/www.elysianbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"M-F: Opens 11:30AM\r\nSat:  11AM - 11PM\r\nSun. 11AM - 10PM","latitude":47.668918,"longitude":-122.333473,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:14","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"ZM1T1b","name":"Ode To Mercy","nameDisplay":"Ode To Mercy","description":"What could possibly be better than the combination of deep roasted malts, coffee, oak, and a smooth, creamy finish?\r\nOde To Mercy overflows with bold flavors woven into a very balanced and approachable beer that finishes with creamy lingering hints of oak, coffee (specially blended by Athens, GA\u2019s 1000 Faces), and roasted goodness.

William, pictured here with his mother, went on to marry Priscilla Needham in 1899 and became Chairman of Frederic Robinson Limited in 1920.\r\nFast forward to the early decades of the 20th century and Frederic\u2019s grandchildren, sons of William, joined the family business. After Frederic\u2019s passing, his widow Emma owned the business in entirety and it was shortly prior to her death that she instigated the formation of Frederic Robinson Limited. 4th generation Robinsons, Frederic, John and Cecil joined the board and continued to build the company alongside their father William.\r\n\r\nWith bottling commencing from a new building in 1908, new offices in 1913 and a new brewhouse in 1929, by William\u2019s death in 1933, despite the countries difficult economic climate, Robinsons was strongly positioned for further growth. Over the following years, the estate grew by acquisition, new buildings and extending the geographical area. The first Welsh house \u2013 The Black Lion was bought in 1943. William Robinson, would have been proud to hear John, his great grandchild, was honoured with a knighthood in 1958 for political and public services in Cheshire- 120 years after William purchased the Unicorn Inn. The early 1950\u2019s saw 5th generation Robinsons, Peter, Dennis and David, starting to join the business.\r\n\r\nOver the past 6 decades Robinsons has continued to grow. 15th October 1975 saw the first bottling at a newly built packaging centre in Bredbury- ongoing development at UPC (Unicorn Packaging Centre) means all our beers are now transferred from Unicorn Brewery to Bredbury for packaging and distribution once fermentation is complete. Robinsons\u2019 bottled ales such as Old Tom and Unicorn are distributed worldwide. The sixth generation strive to build further upon the family legacy. Neil, Veronica, Paul, Oliver and William were elected to the board in September 2003, followed three years later by Sara, who is now Company Secretary and John in May 2009.\r\n\r\nOur eyes are firmly on the future as we develop brewery, brands and pubs at pace. With over \u00a35 million investment in a new Brew House (including the World\u2019s largest hopnik, which strains hops to maximise aroma and flavour), Training Centre for excellence and Visitors Centre, there is much to look forward to.","website":"http:\/\/www.robinsonsbrewery.com\/","established":"1838","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/OEO8JG\/upload_ykqvVX-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/OEO8JG\/upload_ykqvVX-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/OEO8JG\/upload_ykqvVX-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/OEO8JG\/upload_ykqvVX-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/OEO8JG\/upload_ykqvVX-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:46:20","locations":[{"id":"lxWkzT","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Unicorn Brewery","locality":"Stockport","region":"Cheshire","postalCode":"SK11JJ","phone":"44-(0161)-480-6571","website":"http:\/\/www.robinsonsbrewery.com\/","latitude":53.4101496,"longitude":-2.1551029,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"GB","yearOpened":"1838","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"GB","name":"UNITED KINGDOM","displayName":"United Kingdom","isoThree":"GBR","numberCode":826,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"QubU9j","name":"On The Shoulders Of Giants","nameDisplay":"On The Shoulders Of Giants","description":"Collaboration Series: On the Shoulders of Giants\r\n\r\nSir Isaac Newton once wrote \u201cIf I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.\" As an all-sour beer company starting out in a thriving craft beer revolution, this quote has struck a chord in our hearts.\r\n\r\nTake a moment to think about your favorite craft beer, your most memorable brewery visit, and the friends you\u2019ve met through your shared interest in craft beer.

Chris Hunt and Duncan Guy began their brewing education in the Barley Mob Brewers homebrewing club and continued to search for unique and distinctive ale and lager formulas. They decided to offer their creations to the public through a small batch microbrewery in 2006.  Soon thereafter, award-winning brewer Courtney Tyvand joined the two and presented his smoked porter at the brewery\u2019s first beer dinner in October of 2006.\r\n\r\nThe brewery is located on the ground floor of a historic building at 4015 Tennessee Avenue in St. Elmo.  The building is constructed of foot-square cedar timbers and two-foot thick walls made of granite stone and mortar.  Built in 1911 as a packaging factory for K-Rations for WWI, we occasionally find artifacts from that era in the building walls and ceiling.  The brewery shares space with the Chattanooga U-Brew, a brew-on-premises business owned by Greg McCort. \r\n\r\nMBBC is proud to offer small batch specialty ales and lagers in kegs of various sizes.  A tasting room is part of the brewery; samples of our beers can be tasted and tested on premises.  Occasionally we have tasting events or tapping events at the brewery or at a nearby bar or restaurant.  Please check our calendar for scheduled tasting events at the brewery.","website":"http:\/\/www.bendbrewingbeer.com\/","established":"2006","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/zpGIxB\/upload_qc0XVO-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/zpGIxB\/upload_qc0XVO-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/zpGIxB\/upload_qc0XVO-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/zpGIxB\/upload_qc0XVO-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/zpGIxB\/upload_qc0XVO-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:02","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:09:53","locations":[{"id":"7MLLbj","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"4015 Tennessee Avenue","locality":"Chattanooga","region":"Tennessee","postalCode":"37409","phone":"423-821-6392","website":"http:\/\/www.bendbrewingbeer.com\/","latitude":35.007563,"longitude":-85.327766,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2006","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:02","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"4o854Q","name":"Pachamama's Inca Chicha","nameDisplay":"Pachamama's Inca Chicha","description":"A morado maize (purple corn) beer of the Andes mountain range.
