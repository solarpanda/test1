We knew what we wanted to drink, but we needed some help actually brewing it. So we enlisted our first brewer, took over some warehouse space on the Boston waterfront, and began introducing fresh, local craft beer to Boston drinkers. We tried to do it in a way that captured the spirit of fun that had brought us to beer in the first place. From that warehouse, surrounded by fish companies on the docks of South Boston (neighboring what is now the Seaport District), we couldn\u2019t imagine that craft brewing would become what it has today.  \r\n\r\nWe still remember our days on the other side of the bar, and have spent as much time spreading the joy of beer drinking as we have focusing on recipes, ingredients, and brewing equipment. Hopefully our sense of gratitude is reflected in both the quality of the beer and the spirit of fun and enjoyment surrounding our beer and breweries. We invite all of you to visit our Boston brewery, where it all began, and our beautiful brewery in Windsor, Vermont.","website":"http:\/\/www.harpoonbrewery.com\/","established":"1986","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/RzvedX\/upload_AbOUmA-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/RzvedX\/upload_AbOUmA-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/RzvedX\/upload_AbOUmA-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/RzvedX\/upload_AbOUmA-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/RzvedX\/upload_AbOUmA-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:57","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:47:47","locations":[{"id":"AGRvvY","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"336 Ruth Carney Drive","locality":"Windsor","region":"Vermont","postalCode":"05089","phone":"802-674-5491","website":"http:\/\/www.harpoonbrewery.com\/","latitude":43.5130201,"longitude":-72.4016913,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1986","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:57","updateDate":"2014-10-06 15:45:55","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"9aSjFg","name":"Boston","streetAddress":"306 Northern Avenue","locality":"Boston","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"02210","phone":"1-888-HARPOON","website":"http:\/\/www.harpoonbrewery.com","latitude":42.3465,"longitude":-71.033843,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1986","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2014-09-26 14:01:43","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"LPWcu1","name":"Liberty Unfiltered Wheat Ale","nameDisplay":"Liberty Unfiltered Wheat Ale","description":"This light ale is an American interpretation of a German classic.

For Ken Landin and Janine Bennett the answer to that question would always be \"listening to live music and drinking craft beer.\" Fueled by their outrage over the political and corporate disaster that unfolded on the nightly news, and frustrated by the thought that their lifestyle may contribute to the problem, they were at a crossroads. And so began the plan for Crossroads Brewing Company.\r\n \r\nThere was many years of discussion, research, paperwork, rejection, and searching for the perfect property.  After having deals fall through and the economy taking a turn for the worse, their hopes were fading. Then, in December of 2008, the Brooks Opera House in Historic Athens was discovered by accident. After leaving a restaurant just 2 miles from home they noticed a for sale sign on the deteriorating building and it's just like the old saying goes............when you know, you know.\r\n \r\nIt was quickly realized that when a community believes in what you are doing and puts it's support behind you, great things can happen. So they were off and running from the first turn of the key. Restoring a Historic Opera House from 1893 was not part of the original plan but with hard work and their secret weapon, Janine's brother Jimmy, things are coming together. Ken, Janine, Jimmy and Janine's Dad, Jim, have had their hands on just about every square inch of this 15,000 square foot building. Little by little, this grand and unique property will be restored to it's former glory.\r\n  \r\nEveryday seems to bring a new challenge but the ultimate goal remains clear. This building was once the hub of this sleepy riverside village and Ken and Janine intend to return it to the community. The second floor, where the Opera House once was, will get a new stage for plays and musical performances of all kinds. Athens is surrounded by hard working farmers so looking any further for meats and produce just doesn't make sense.  From organic menu items to earth friendly building materials the environment is a factor in every decision that is made along the way. They hope to eventually have the brewery running \"off the grid\" as well.\r\n \r\nKen, Janine, Brewer Hutch Kugeman and Chef Paul Parillo invite you to come visit the pub in Athens, NY.  There's 10 craft beers on tap and a menu that showcases the small farms of the Hudson Valley.   Cheers!","website":"http:\/\/crossroadsbrewingco.com\/","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/tE9Evu\/upload_EHTHYJ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/tE9Evu\/upload_EHTHYJ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/tE9Evu\/upload_EHTHYJ-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/tE9Evu\/upload_EHTHYJ-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/tE9Evu\/upload_EHTHYJ-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:11:28","locations":[{"id":"yqQtUG","name":"Brewery & Restaurant","streetAddress":"21 Second Street","locality":"Athens","region":"New York","postalCode":"12015","phone":"518-945-2337","website":"http:\/\/crossroadsbrewingco.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon, Wed & Thurs.: 4:00 pm-9:00 pm\r\nFriday: 4:00 pm-12:00 am\r\nSaturday: 1:00 pm-12:00 am\r\nSunday: 1:00 pm-9:00 pm\r\nClosed Tuesdays","latitude":42.260511,"longitude":-73.8096826,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2010","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"zb8owm","name":"Lilikoi Wheat","nameDisplay":"Lilikoi Wheat","description":"The color of a sunbeam glancing off the waves, this delicious golden passion fruit infused wheat ale brings a tropical island getaway to you, no matter where you are.","abv":"5.5","srmId":13,"styleId":112,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/zb8owm\/upload_kuYfve-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/zb8owm\/upload_kuYfve-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/zb8owm\/upload_kuYfve-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-12-23 18:38:08","updateDate":"2015-12-17 20:42:35","srm":{"id":13,"name":"13","hex":"CB6200"},"style":{"id":112,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Light American Wheat Ale or Lager with Yeast","shortName":"Wheat Ale","description":"This beer can be made using either ale or lager yeast.

There are always at least 6-8 beers on tap and Hard Cider and select \"guest\" craft beers are also available on draught. Interestingly, the Auburn Alehouse is located just 1\/10th of a mile from the original Auburn Brewery, which brewed for thirsty Auburnites from 1855 until 1908. You may stop by for the ale, but you\u2019ll find the food is a star attraction as well.

A labor of love in which long brew days in the garage, bad equipment, curious dogs (we still blame them for a bad batch or two) and hanging out with friends became commonplace. Once it took root, this hobby turned into a passion (along with some really solid beers).\r\n\r\nWe took our wares to football games, parties, and cookouts. Before too long, folks began requesting our beer. It\u2019s pretty fun to have someone you don\u2019t even know walk right smack dab up to you and tell you how much they like your beer. We didn\u2019t set out to start a business, the business just found us. \r\n\r\n\u201cOnce in a while you get shown the light in the strangest of places if you look at it right\u201d Robert Hunter\r\n\r\nWe wanted to brew our beer and create something that would make our families, friends, community, and ourselves proud in what we were doing. We wanted to give back and help support those that helped support us.  We wanted to represent the unique qualities of the South that make us proud to be southerners. \r\n\r\nGood People Brewing Company seemed like the perfect fit.  Good People describes the kind, humble, concerned, and respected folks all throughout the South, no matter if your speaking singularly or plurally. That is what we strive for here at Good People Brewing Company\u2026.to be good people. \r\n\r\nIn September of 2007, we acquired our equipment and started getting our brewery put together. It was a long, frustrating, and tiring process\u2026.but it was flat worth every bit of it all.\r\n\r\nSo if you are looking for something made in small batches with high quality ingredients and pride, please give us a shot.\r\n\r\nThe Brewery\r\nWe brew on a two kettle, combi-tank and brew kettle, 20 bbl system manufactured by New World Systems.
