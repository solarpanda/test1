This ale, brewed with imported Belgian specialty malts supported by a traditional English floor malt backbone, is hopped with some of America\u2019s most popular whole-cone hop varieties yielding a surprisingly refreshing and well-balanced pale ale.  Pronounced flavors of fruit, citrus, pine and grapefruit balance a caramelized toastiness from our unique malt combination appealing to both hop-heads and malt-lovers alike.  Expect a medium-bodied ale with a dry finish that will lend itself to easy drinking any time of year.","abv":"4.9","ibu":"42","glasswareId":13,"srmId":9,"availableId":1,"styleId":25,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/PFms0w\/upload_ncOkmZ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/PFms0w\/upload_ncOkmZ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/PFms0w\/upload_ncOkmZ-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","servingTemperature":"cold","servingTemperatureDisplay":"Cold - (4-7C\/39-45F)","originalGravity":"1.052","createDate":"2015-03-30 14:40:56","updateDate":"2016-06-01 01:53:09","glass":{"id":13,"name":"Willi","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"srm":{"id":9,"name":"9","hex":"E58500"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":25,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"American Pale","description":"American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.

Linus found a used 10 bbl brewing system from a brewpub in Iowa that had gone out of business, and went to work restoring a corner of the old Marathon Motorworks building for their brewery.
