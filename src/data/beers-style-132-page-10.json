So honored we took this all the way.  After poking around in his collection of brews, we decided on Folklore.  However, our remix of Folklore is loose as a goose..just like we want it.  This beer is brewed as an amber ale infused with cacao and coffee, with portions aged in bourbon barrels and finally dried out with a dose of brettanomyces yeast.  The resulting beer is unlike any you can imagine.  Dark fruit, chocolate, and wild yeast flavors all comingle with a slightly vinious undertone...its like that time you went to the disco and saw Babe the blue ox dancing with Paul Bunyan.

The idea spread as friends tasted the unique beers, and the popularity of those early batches encouraged a dedicated team of three partners to begin working to make the dream of a local brewery a reality. Mark Seibold, JD Merryweather and Daniel Mercer spent the next two years traveling throughout the United States, Europe and Central America visiting breweries and sampling local flavors. The insight gained from entrepreneurs, brewers, biologists, operations personnel and consumers provided an invaluable basis for a serious endeavor into quality commercial brewing. By integrating this knowledge with the local, regional and national brewing trends, as well as local feedback, the trio planned the birth and growth of the yet unnamed COOP. After nearly 3 years of research, comprising thousands of man hours and dozens of test batches, COOP fashioned its identity as a steadfast professional team that holds closely a passion for bringing quality, local beer to taps and homes in Oklahoma City and beyond.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWith the help of close friends and fellow craft-beer fans, COOP was capitalized on July 15th, 2008. In less than 6 months, the COOP team; navigated the multi-layered regulatory process, secured a building lease, completed the remodel, purchased and installed a commercial brewery, obtained brewing licenses from the State of Oklahoma and the Federal Tax and Trade Bureau, created and branded original recipe beers and brewed the first full scale batches for distribution.\r\n\r\nThe outpouring of support that has come from friends of the COOP team has been overwhelming. Our sincere hope is that you \u2013 the fan of COOP Ale Works \u2013 will take pride in the beers, as if they were your own.

As a brewery we are dedicated to creating the finest beers to represent the unique culture and diverse natural aspects of this region. Each beer is named after a local feature that is unique to the area.\r\n\r\nThe Brewery is located on the side of the largest mountain in Orange County in the city of Rancho Santa Margarita. The great views from Santiago peak and the trails through the canyons provide some of the natural inspiration for the beers and the company.\r\n\r\nThe brewery is small and accessible to all with a warm and comfortable tasting area. So don\u2019t hesitate to come by when in the area.\r\n\r\n(cis-mon-tane)\r\n\r\n\u201cThis side of the mountains\u201d, in reference to coastal Southern California. This was a common term used for Southern California while it was forming its identity during the gold rush and before prohibition.","website":"http:\/\/www.cismontanebrewing.com\/","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/kvM7wC\/upload_UCMhwI-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/kvM7wC\/upload_UCMhwI-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/kvM7wC\/upload_UCMhwI-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/kvM7wC\/upload_UCMhwI-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/kvM7wC\/upload_UCMhwI-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:16:43","locations":[{"id":"nLsoQ9","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"29851 Aventura","extendedAddress":"Suite D","locality":"Rancho Santa Margarita","region":"California","postalCode":"92688","phone":"949-888-2739","website":"http:\/\/www.cismontanebrewing.blogspot.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  3:00pm - 9:00pm\r\nTue:  3:00pm - 9:00pm\r\nWed:  3:00pm - 9:00pm\r\nThu:  3:00pm - 9:00pm\r\nFri:  3:00pm - 9:00pm\r\nSat:  12:00pm - 9:00pm\r\nSun:  12:00pm - 5:00pm","latitude":33.6366956,"longitude":-117.6096074,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2010","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2016-04-30 15:34:09","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"XBulsX","name":"The Coqui","nameDisplay":"The Coqui","abv":"11","styleId":132,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/XBulsX\/upload_ZpZ5K9-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/XBulsX\/upload_ZpZ5K9-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/XBulsX\/upload_ZpZ5K9-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-04-14 16:48:39","updateDate":"2015-12-18 02:01:55","style":{"id":132,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Wood- and Barrel-Aged Beer","shortName":"BBL Aged","description":"A wood- or barrel-aged beer is any lager, ale or hybrid beer, either a traditional style or a unique experimental beer that has been aged for a period of time in a wooden barrel or in contact with wood.

They also take time to push the limits of brewing with the \"Brick Mason\" series, which the staff sees as their continuing masterpiece. Highlights from this series include \"The Lost Years\" old ale, \"Black-Eye Rye\" American black ale, and the most recent release \"20th Anniversary\", a 10% Imperial stout that was aged in Buffalo Trace bourbon barrels. Early accolades have already compared it to the hallowed KBS.\r\n\r\nThe future keeps looking brighter and brighter for this brewery, and the next couple years will see them growing and experimenting with diverse styles, collaborating with fellow breweries, implementing a new barrel program, and continuing to raise the bar for themselves in all aspects.

Thus a peaty\/smoky character may be evident at low to medium levels (ales with medium-high or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category).

We peaked at just over 120 barrels in our program this year, yet only 53 barrels made this year\u2019s final blend.  We have stayed true to our original goal of making straight ahead strong ales and letting them rest in wood barrels to mature and develop flavors slowly and naturally.  We again met with some of the area\u2019s best wine makers and allowed them to guide us to the finished product.  Most of the beers that are in this blend are old friends who we know well.  Dark and ominous Parabola along with the rich and complex Bravo Brown were brewed again this year and together became the center piece of this blend.  Other beers like the Rufus and Opal along with Sean Paxton\u2019s Saucerful of Secrets are still tucked away in the cellar in their original first generation form, gaining character with extended aging.   Velvet Merkin has established itself as a real barrel loving beer, although it is only 6%, it carries barrel qualities beautifully.  A new beer, that was created this year by our Cellar Master Ali Razi, is Double Double Barrel Ale and it found its way into this blend as well.  In the end, this year brought us seven wine makers and seven beers to counter balance our lucky thirteenth year of brewing beer on the Central Coast.

We knew what we wanted to drink, but we needed some help actually brewing it. So we enlisted our first brewer, took over some warehouse space on the Boston waterfront, and began introducing fresh, local craft beer to Boston drinkers. We tried to do it in a way that captured the spirit of fun that had brought us to beer in the first place. From that warehouse, surrounded by fish companies on the docks of South Boston (neighboring what is now the Seaport District), we couldn\u2019t imagine that craft brewing would become what it has today.  \r\n\r\nWe still remember our days on the other side of the bar, and have spent as much time spreading the joy of beer drinking as we have focusing on recipes, ingredients, and brewing equipment. Hopefully our sense of gratitude is reflected in both the quality of the beer and the spirit of fun and enjoyment surrounding our beer and breweries.
