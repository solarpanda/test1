It is also not a \"sweet\" tasting beer, and it actually finishes rather dry. What makes this beer different from traditional honey beers is that the honey is completely fermented out, leaving little residual sweetness.

In fact we\u2019ve had it figured out for years.  We both had our hearts set on brewing the sort of beer we loved so much in Yorkshire.\r\nMany people know that Martha and I love Theakston\u2019s Old Peculier, at least the cask version.  But Robinson\u2019s Old Tom is high on our list as well.  Now that Samuel Smith has released Yorkshire Stingo that makes three.  At the brewery where I worked in Yorkshire we made a unique beer called \u201cMorocco Ale\u201d  that is quite similar as well.\r\n\r\nObviously PRETTY THINGS isn\u2019t all about simple replication.  As a rule we don\u2019t do beer \u201cstyles\u201d straight up, as it doesn\u2019t leave any room for creativity.  Instead we take our inspiration from great beers as a starting point.\r\n\r\n\u201cRustic Dark Ale\u201d, is about as apt a descriptor as we could come up with for Saint Botolph\u2019s Town (we almost used \u201cNew World Stingo\u201d but decided to save that for a future beer).  This ale is formulated with the malts of Thomas Fawcett & Sons of Yorkshire, England as its base.  When I was brewing in Yorkshire I visited this magnificent maltings many times, seeing crystal and roasted malts still made by hand. On brew day their crystal malt gave an amazing golden raisin-like aroma in the kettle.  Fantastic!\r\n\r\nAs we did in Jack D\u2019Or, we used a small amount of Malted Oats, but cut it this time with Torrefied Wheat.  We \u201cchaptalized\u201d using four different types of sugar in very small doses for both flavour AND colour.\r\n\r\nSBT is fermented with two yeast strains for a unique rustic finish.  But it\u2019s in the yeast strains where this beer really departs from the typical: one is a German ale strain, the other is a common English strain.  Why?  Because it\u2019s about the flavour, not just ticking the \u201cstyle\u201d boxes.\r\n\r\nIn the end we have an ale of 5.9% abv with a big malty, almost smokey Black Malt character, a bitter attack from Fuggle hops, a rich barleymalt finish, some dried coconut hints and an old ale acidity around the edges.  We\u2019ve even timed its tan head, standing proud for ten minutes!\r\n\r\nThe name \u201cSaint Botolph\u2019s Town\u201d is in tribute to our great home in America: Boston.  The original Boston in Lincolnshire, England is an abbreviation of \u201cBotolph\u2019s Town\u201d or \u201cBotolph\u2019s Stone\u201d. When we were back in Yorkshire recently, we found a churchyard where St. Botolph spoke in the year 675; a \u2018stump\u2019 (broken old cross) marks the spot.  Saint Botolph is a 7th century saint from England whose feast day is June 17th.  Perhaps a great day to save a bottle or two for!","abv":"5.9","ibu":"38","availableId":1,"styleId":12,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/dS4nw6\/upload_LF8m9g-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/dS4nw6\/upload_LF8m9g-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/dS4nw6\/upload_LF8m9g-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-04-23 18:52:44","updateDate":"2015-12-16 16:41:13","available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":12,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"English-Style Brown Ale","shortName":"English Brown","description":"English brown ales range from copper to brown in color.

In fact, he's managed to combine his scientific background with an artistic, if somewhat bohemian, flair for beermaking to create what The Globe and Mail and Vancouver Province newspapers have called some of the best suds around. \r\n\r\nBart's brewery skills are complemented by Tracey's tenacious management and marketing skills. Tracey has a degree in biology; but she too is immersed in the brewing business.
