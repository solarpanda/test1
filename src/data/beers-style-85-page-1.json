However, the endeavor was well worth it as Brown\u2019s Brewing Company became an instant success as the first brewery restaurant in the Capital Region.\r\n\r\nToday, our River Street Taproom in Troy, New York is a social hub for the community and offers a menu that compliments the beer we brew on site. We brew over 25 different styles of ales and lagers throughout the year and serve over a dozen beers on tap at any one time. Our dependable ales and lagers are also available in bottles at home or on draft in select taverns and restaurants throughout the Capital Region.","website":"http:\/\/www.brownsbrewing.com\/","established":"1993","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/HnWya6\/upload_Vv7NlC-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/HnWya6\/upload_Vv7NlC-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/HnWya6\/upload_Vv7NlC-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/HnWya6\/upload_Vv7NlC-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/HnWya6\/upload_Vv7NlC-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:05:37","locations":[{"id":"wadu38","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"417-419 River Street","locality":"Troy","region":"New York","postalCode":"12180","phone":"518-273-2337","website":"http:\/\/www.brownsbrewing.com\/","latitude":42.735771,"longitude":-73.687704,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1993","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"J2HIwa","name":"Smokey the Beer","nameDisplay":"Smokey the Beer","abv":"5.4","ibu":"13","glasswareId":13,"srmId":25,"availableId":4,"styleId":85,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","originalGravity":"1.058","createDate":"2015-08-18 19:06:10","updateDate":"2015-08-18 19:06:44","glass":{"id":13,"name":"Willi","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"srm":{"id":25,"name":"25","hex":"7B1A00"},"available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":85,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Bamberg-Style M\u00e4rzen Rauchbier","shortName":"M\u00e4rzen Rauchbier","description":"Bamberg-style Rauchbier M\u00e4rzen should have beechwood smoky characters that range from detectable to prevalent in the aroma and flavor.
