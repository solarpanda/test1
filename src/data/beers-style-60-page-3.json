Rich with complexity and flavor, try savoring it with a fine dinner. You also might enjoy it as an aperitif or as an accompaniment to a dessert, but QUAD stands alone quite well. We recommend enjoying QUAD in a brandy snifter or wineglass so you can drink in the aroma of this fine ale.\r\n\r\nAs with any higher alcohol beers, QUAD will be at its best after a period 12 months or so in the bottle, perhaps longer. We expect a shelf life of 3-5 years, but go ahead, we know you can\u2019t wait. Enjoy one now, and another every month or two, and you\u2019ll be truly amazed as QUAD gains smoothness and complexity over time as it ages.\r\n\r\nQuad is available in November and December.","abv":"11.8","ibu":"39","glasswareId":6,"availableId":4,"styleId":60,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/R1oHSN\/upload_PYuNUt-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/R1oHSN\/upload_PYuNUt-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/R1oHSN\/upload_PYuNUt-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","originalGravity":"1.111","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:44:01","updateDate":"2015-12-15 23:24:06","glass":{"id":6,"name":"Snifter","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":60,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Quadrupel","shortName":"Belgian Quad","description":"Quadrupels or \"Quads\" are characterized by the immense presence of alcohol and balanced flavor, bitterness and aromas.
