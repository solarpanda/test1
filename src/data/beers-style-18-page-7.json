Their love of beer began in the 90\u2019s, which eventually lead to homebrewing, and an endless pursuit of finding the best craft beers the World had to offer.\r\n\r\nThey chose the name \"Chandeleur\" in honor of one of their favorite places, the Chandeleur Islands off the coast of Mississippi. The uninhabited island chain is approximately 50 miles long and is home to some of the best redfish and speckled trout fishing on the planet.\r\n\r\nCam and Cain were born and raised in Gulfport, MS. Being raised on the coast instilled in them a true love for the water. When they\u2019re not brewing beer, you\u2019re almost guaranteed to find them fishing or cruising in a boat with family.\r\n\r\nAs they gained a real passion for craft beer and continued to hone their homebrewing skills, they began to dream about opening their own microbrewery. Several years later, in July of 2012, Senate Bill 2878 became law, raising the permissible alcohol content in Mississippi beer from 5% by weight (6.25%ABV) to 8% by weight (10.1% ABV). The fellas knew that it was high time to start making their dream into a reality. And, they knew that Mississippi was the place to do it.\r\n\r\nIn December of 2013, they purchased a historic building in downtown Gulfport and broke ground for what is now Chandeleur Brewing Company. Their vision is to handcraft some of the most excellent ales on the Gulf Coast using only the finest, freshest malted barley, hops, and local ingredients.","website":"http:\/\/www.chandeleurbrew.com\/","established":"2015","mailingListUrl":"info@chandeleurbrew.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/nJFd7Y\/upload_JJE9yV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/nJFd7Y\/upload_JJE9yV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/nJFd7Y\/upload_JJE9yV-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/nJFd7Y\/upload_JJE9yV-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/nJFd7Y\/upload_JJE9yV-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-08 03:01:40","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:05:40","locations":[{"id":"n7K72G","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2711 14th Street","locality":"Gulfport","region":"Mississippi","postalCode":"39501","phone":"228-701-9985","website":"http:\/\/www.chandeleurbrew.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Thu:  4:00pm - 7:00pm\nFri:  4:00pm - 7:00pm\nSat:  1:00pm - 4:00pm\n\n","latitude":30.367822,"longitude":-89.09537,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2015","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-08 03:01:40","updateDate":"2015-03-13 17:16:03","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"M9VEOA","name":"Currfee Purrmkin Purr","nameDisplay":"Currfee Purrmkin Purr","description":"Lacto porter with coffee and pumpkin spice","abv":"4.6","styleId":18,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-09-07 15:21:13","updateDate":"2015-09-07 15:21:13","style":{"id":18,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Brown Porter","shortName":"Brown Porter","description":"Brown porters are mid to dark brown (may have red tint) in color.

During his college days the head brewer, Derek Luke, reaquired a homebrewing kit he had given his sister and quickly went to work brewing and passing his knowledge along to the company's president, Brent Ryan. As Graduation grew near and the cold reality of post-collegiate life set in Luke and Ryan knew that they could turn their affinity for beer and their new found ability to make it into a viable alternative to unemployment or sitting at a desk answering to \"The Man\". Of course, they couldn't do it by themselves, so after very little convincing, they got roommate and friends, Mark Sinclair and Will Rafferty to join them.\r\n\r\nOn Father's Day in 1999, after almost two years of planning and preperation, the first batch of Hurricane Amber Ale was brewed. By July 2nd the first kegs had been shipped to three Newport Restaurants and were quickly tapped and emptied. A little over a month after the release of the first kegs, 6-packs of Hurricane Amber Ale began to hit the shelves. Since then we have expanded our product line and our distribution territory but continue to brew up a storm in our Middletown Brewery.","website":"http:\/\/www.newportstorm.com\/","established":"1999","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/IphbdN\/upload_FchmX0-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/IphbdN\/upload_FchmX0-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/IphbdN\/upload_FchmX0-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/IphbdN\/upload_FchmX0-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/IphbdN\/upload_FchmX0-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:43:44","locations":[{"id":"oz1oll","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"307 Oliphant Lane","locality":"Middletown","region":"Rhode Island","postalCode":"02842","phone":"401-849-5232","website":"http:\/\/www.newportstorm.com\/","latitude":41.5369904,"longitude":-71.2796012,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1999","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2014-09-26 13:18:19","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"1eVDrI","name":"Cyclopes Coconut Porter","nameDisplay":"Cyclopes Coconut Porter","abv":"6","ibu":"33.3","srmId":29,"styleId":18,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"dessert!","createDate":"2015-12-17 21:05:47","updateDate":"2015-12-17 21:05:48","srm":{"id":29,"name":"29","hex":"660D00"},"style":{"id":18,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Brown Porter","shortName":"Brown Porter","description":"Brown porters are mid to dark brown (may have red tint) in color.

Initially started in a barn on old farmland near Corcoran Vineyards, this combination became Virginia\u2019s first vineyard \/ brewery combo in the state. After several years of growing business it was realized that there was not enough room to stay as demand for the beer grew. In early 2014 the brewery was moved to Purcellville Virginia which is about 6 miles from where it started.\r\n\r\nCorcoran Brewing Company has produced over thirty three distinct beers since opening day. We strive to create both traditional beer types as well as creating unique experiences with experimental beers. On any given day we have twelve beers on tap ranging from Kolch style, American Pale Ales, IPA\u2019s, Imperial IPA\u2019s, Stouts, Bourbon barrel aged, port barrel aged and more. This daily broad selection of quality hand-made craft beers has been a primary reason for our success.

Since then, the Central PA natives have been handcrafting world-class beers that blend traditional brewing techniques with the innovation and eclecticism of the American craft brewing movement. Today, the Hershey, PA-based brewery produces six year-round beers (Hopback Amber Ale, Troegenator Double Bock, JavaHead Stout, Tr\u00f6egs Pale Ale, DreamWeaver Wheat, and Perpetual IPA); four seasonal releases as part of the Hop Cycle series (Cultivator Helles Bock, Sunshine Pils, Hop Knife Harvest Ale, and Blizzard of Hops Winter IPA); and two limited beers (Nugget Nectar and Mad Elf Ale). \r\n\r\nIn addition to these beers, Tr\u00f6egs produces a variety of experimental, small batch beers as part of its Scratch Beer Series. These beers are available exclusively at the brewery and most are draft-only limited releases, although some popular Scratch Beers (Fresh Hop Ale, Fest Lager, etc.) are bottled for release through the General Store at the brewery. \r\n\r\nIn late 2013, Tr\u00f6egs introduced a special line of cork & cage bottle releases. The first, LaGrave, is available year-round. Master of Pumpkins was also released in 2013 and will continue with availability in the fall. Other beers such as Jovial have since followed suit. The addition of a canning line not only offers the brewery more flexibility in the way it presents its beers, but also allows Tr\u00f6egs to provide customers with more packaging options. To date, Tr\u00f6egs has released Perpetual IPA and Sunshine Pils in 12-ounce cans and Troegenator in 16-ounce cans. Plans to release other seasonal and limited beers in cans are currently in the works. \r\n\r\nThe Splinter Series is an extremely limited line of barrel-aged beers packaged in cork & cage bottles. While only a handful of these beers have been produced, Tr\u00f6egs plans to expand this series with the inclusion of Nebulous (barrel-aged LaGrave with Brett), bourbon barrel-aged Troegenator, and others. \r\n\r\nTr\u00f6egs currently distributes its beers throughout Delaware, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Washington D.C. In addition, Tr\u00f6egs plans to expand into other New England markets in 2015.\r\n\r\nOur state-of-the-art facility gives visitors a glimpse into the workings of a full production brewery by offering both guided tasting and self-guided tours. Our Tasting Room provides ample seating with views of the brewhouse, where you can sit back and enjoy one of our six year-round beers as well as a variety of seasonal and small-batch experimental brews. \r\n\r\nOur Snack Bar reflects our constant desire to explore, discover and share by focusing on fresh, simple fare that is locally sourced and house-made. With that in mind, we feature a seasonally rotating menu with daily chef\u2019s specials.\r\n\r\nwww.troegs.com","website":"http:\/\/www.troegs.com\/","established":"1997","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/www.troegs.com\/about_us\/newsletter.aspx","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_d9lSk3-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_d9lSk3-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_d9lSk3-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_d9lSk3-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_d9lSk3-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:01:05","locations":[{"id":"C6iHOv","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"200 E Hersheypark Dr","locality":"Hershey","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"17033","phone":"717-232-1297","website":"http:\/\/www.troegs.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sun:  11:00am - 9:00pm\nThu:  11:00am - 10:00pm\nFri:  11:00am - 10:00pm\nSat:  11:00am - 10:00pm\n\nGeneral Store Hours\r\n------------------------------\r\nSunday: 11am to 5pm\r\nMonday - Saturday: 11am to 8pm","latitude":40.2972852,"longitude":-76.6428527,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1997","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2015-04-24 16:00:33","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"75ovpm","name":"Deadhorse","nameDisplay":"Deadhorse","description":"Traditionally untraditional \"an oatmeal and brown sugar entire\" a precursor to the porter, well balanced, dry, faintly roasty, slightly chocoaltey, moderately warm, HEAVILY DRINKABLE.

Always looking to take a good thing too far, we sat down and over a beer (or two) decided that beer itself was a good idea. Of course, not just some easy-drinking institutional prole beer, but stuff like the beers we'd had at great bars. We had frequented places with extensive and varied beer lists. Places with lists 180 items long, all of which we tried twice (not in one night). In short, we wanted beer with flavor. Complexity. Character. Intensity. Not words found in the mass market lexicon.\r\n\r\nSo with a banjo burner, a bunch of industrial kitchen sized pots and as many buckets as we could find, we jumped in feet first. Once a week, every week. We tried to emulate the beers we liked, but soon we were adding a little of this, or some of that and after a while we started having a hard time pegging our beer in a style category. Our first success was a Porter that was mainly porter, slightly stout. We ran it blind with our friends against the porters we liked and people liked it. \"We're on to something\", we thought. Twenty iterations, modifications and tweaks later it is Distorter, and is still our favorite beer.\r\n\r\nThis led to twice a week brewing and handing out bottle after bottle to everyone we knew. Along the way we screwed up a wheat beer by accidentally making it into sort of a copper ale with a few too many hops. And so Red Bud Ale was born. We had some extra noble hops and threw them in the IPA, and with some tinkering we most certainly had a one-of-a-kind IPA. You get the picture. All of this has firmly cemented our \"anything goes\" approach to beer making. Our inability to ever get quite within the style guidelines means we may never win an award, but we're ok with that.\r\n\r\nNow, several years later and with a 90% super-cool\/10% Rube Goldberg 7 bbl version of our banjo burner and kitchen pots, we're befuddling the beer judges and converting the masses. One pint at a time.\r\n\r\nStop in the storefront and try our mainstays, seasonals and small-batch runs. Not to mention our lab beers, where we continue to screw up one thing or another in search of the next great beer.","website":"http:\/\/www.greenbushbrewing.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:19:53","locations":[{"id":"AlhRYb","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"5885 Sawyer Rd.","locality":"Sawyer","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49125","phone":"269-405-1076","website":"http:\/\/www.greenbushbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sunday - Thursday: 12-8\r\nFriday and Saturday: 12-10","latitude":41.8856286,"longitude":-86.5946671,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"kcDoYG","name":"Dive Bomb Porter","nameDisplay":"Dive Bomb Porter","description":"An unpredictable Brown Porter style ale.
