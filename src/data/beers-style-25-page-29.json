A strong floral and citrus character from generous dryhopping blends with strawberry esters from our house yeast strain for an inviting and satiating aroma.

This is the spirit of Slumbrew.\r\n\r\nSlumbrew is the research & development brand and concept of Somerville Brewing Company. Our mission is to brew unique, ingredient-driven beers that challenge common notions of what a beer should taste like. It is the result of nearly 15 years of beer travel and research by Caitlin Jewell and Jeff Leiter; and a decade of Jeff\u2019s homebrewing recipe formulation.\r\n\r\nWe produce a lot of small-run, pilot beers at the Slumbrew Beerlab, but only a small number make their way to commercial production. The Somerville Brewing Company contracts with regional breweries to make the best recipes for wide-spread commercial release, but each recipe is an evolving process of refinement. This model for beer production provides an opportunity to experiment with innovative local ingredients to produce craft beers that stand apart from typical formulations.","website":"http:\/\/www.slumbrew.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gwDTjS\/upload_6jyi8Y-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gwDTjS\/upload_6jyi8Y-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gwDTjS\/upload_6jyi8Y-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gwDTjS\/upload_6jyi8Y-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gwDTjS\/upload_6jyi8Y-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-02-13 00:30:15","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:28:13","locations":[{"id":"pATY6L","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"15 Ward St.","locality":"Somerville","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"02143","phone":"1-800-428-1150","website":"http:\/\/www.slumbrew.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  11:00am - 12:00am\nTue:  11:00am - 12:00am\nWed:  11:00am - 12:00am\nThu:  11:00am - 12:00am\nFri:  11:00am - 12:00am\nSat:  11:00am - 12:00am\nSun:  11:00am - 10:00pm\n\n","latitude":42.3748173,"longitude":-71.0892732,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-02-13 00:36:08","updateDate":"2015-05-08 13:45:09","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"KmOr3n","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"15 Ward Street","locality":"Somerville","region":"MA","hoursOfOperation":"11am - 12am","latitude":42.3748173,"longitude":-71.0892732,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2015-04-29 21:38:08","updateDate":"2015-05-08 13:45:44","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"dgdVJz","name":"American Fresh Beer Garden","streetAddress":"310 Canal St.","locality":"Somerville","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"02145","phone":"1.800.428.1150","hoursOfOperation":"Tue:  11:00am - 10:00pm\nWed:  11:00am - 10:00am\nThu:  11:00am - 12:00am\nFri:  11:00am - 12:00am\nSat:  11:00am - 12:00am\nSun:  11:00am - 12:00am\n\n","latitude":42.3941311,"longitude":-71.079673,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-05-08 13:50:59","updateDate":"2015-05-08 13:50:59","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"uFonXr","name":"Island Reserve: HBC 342 Hopsicle Ale","nameDisplay":"Island Reserve: HBC 342 Hopsicle Ale","styleId":25,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/uFonXr\/upload_009pnh-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/uFonXr\/upload_009pnh-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/uFonXr\/upload_009pnh-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-10-29 15:33:49","updateDate":"2015-12-16 20:11:57","style":{"id":25,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"American Pale","description":"American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.

For beer lovers, the closing was not a complete disaster. Thankfully, Brakspear\u2019s master brewer, Peter Scholey, was determined to strike out on his own.
