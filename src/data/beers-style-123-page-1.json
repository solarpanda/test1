Coffee.  Anyone who knows Carol knows that one of these two beverages answers the question \u201cWhat are you in the mood to drink?\u201d\r\nA complex beer with a beautiful orange hue, you\u2019ll be able to spend some time analyzing this one. The next in the Linsey\u2019s Lab series, two coffees were added to the pale base:  Ethiopian Baaroo, roasted by Peritus Coffee, and Yrgsheffee Gedeo (also Ethiopian), roasted by The Bean Cycle.  Both coffees are dry processed, meaning the fruit is allowed to dry on the seed before the pulp is removed, resulting in some interesting fruit flavors in addition to customary dark coffee notes.  This is borne out in the beer:  delicate coffee aroma melds with tropical, berry and citrus fruits.  Hops were chosen to complement these fruity flavors, and malts balance coffee notes on the finish, lending to a residual sweetness.
