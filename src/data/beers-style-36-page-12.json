Like the history of brewing in Philadelphia the name Philadelphia Brewing Company has gone through many revivals. The same can be said of our brewery building - the former Wiesbrod and Hess Brewing Company complex in Kensington. At Philadelphia Brewing Co we take pride in our brews, our people, and our community. One person could never do everything that it takes to get beer into your glass. And it may sound obvious, but we won't brew anything that we wouldn't drink ourselves - you won't catch us drinking anything called Ultra unless it's a literal name meaning more flavor, more hops, more malt, more carbs. That's because we are Brewers; proud brewers of fine hand crafted Ales from our historic brewery building in the Kensington neighborhood of Philadelphia. Now that's out of the way; we will be starting out with four mainstay brews which will be available in draught and in bottles. Once we're stocked up on the core brews we'll start pumping out regular seasonal or specialty brews. The specialty series will be driven by our individual brewers and the desires and whims of the rest of our family.  The beer is flowing at Philadelphia Brewing co! You can find our four brands on tap at finer establishments all around town!","website":"http:\/\/philadelphiabrewing.com","established":"1885","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/I3zXID\/upload_frIxF6-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/I3zXID\/upload_frIxF6-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/I3zXID\/upload_frIxF6-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/I3zXID\/upload_frIxF6-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/I3zXID\/upload_frIxF6-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:05","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:54:29","locations":[{"id":"I9iOxV","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2423 Amber St","locality":"Philadelphia","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"19125","phone":"215-427-BREW (2739)","website":"http:\/\/philadelphiabrewing.com\/index.htm","latitude":39.982733,"longitude":-75.127469,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:05","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Ha8oY4","name":"Float Trip Ale","nameDisplay":"Float Trip Ale","description":"A wheat-based blonde ale featuring subdued fruitiness with a light hop bitterness and a smooth finish.

They benefit from multiple fresh water springs and a waterfall on their farm, and they continually find themselves drawn to the rivers that flow around their farm and throughout the Ozarks.\r\n\r\nJoleen and Brian first made beer on the kitchen stove, fermenting it in the basement of their 100-year old farm house.  In July 2010 they partnered together to revive a 70-year old barn made from red and white oak trees harvested off the farm, and Piney River Brewing Company was born.\r\n\r\nThe barn, rechristened BARn, is home to Piney River Brewing Company.  Joleen and Brian began the craft brewery as a \u201cnanobrewery\u201d, brewing on a 10-gallon Sabco system.  In the fall of 2011, a 7-barrel brewhouse with an automatic canning line was put in place for the microbrewery.\r\n\r\nInsane?...No, we're having the time of our lives!","website":"http:\/\/www.pineyriverbrewing.com\/","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/H1ouEw\/upload_uSXA9G-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/H1ouEw\/upload_uSXA9G-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/H1ouEw\/upload_uSXA9G-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/H1ouEw\/upload_uSXA9G-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/H1ouEw\/upload_uSXA9G-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:05","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:14:26","locations":[{"id":"TKwUTr","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"15194 Walnut Grove Drive","locality":"Bucyrus","region":"Missouri","postalCode":"65444","phone":"417-967-6786","website":"http:\/\/www.pineyriverbrewing.com\/","latitude":37.3208964,"longitude":-92.0165208,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2010","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:05","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"TtkBXh","name":"Flying Monkeys (Vliegende Aapen) Golden Ale","nameDisplay":"Flying Monkeys (Vliegende Aapen) Golden Ale","description":"This is a Belgian-style Golden Ale.

Their love of beer began in the 90\u2019s, which eventually lead to homebrewing, and an endless pursuit of finding the best craft beers the World had to offer.\r\n\r\nThey chose the name \"Chandeleur\" in honor of one of their favorite places, the Chandeleur Islands off the coast of Mississippi. The uninhabited island chain is approximately 50 miles long and is home to some of the best redfish and speckled trout fishing on the planet.\r\n\r\nCam and Cain were born and raised in Gulfport, MS. Being raised on the coast instilled in them a true love for the water. When they\u2019re not brewing beer, you\u2019re almost guaranteed to find them fishing or cruising in a boat with family.\r\n\r\nAs they gained a real passion for craft beer and continued to hone their homebrewing skills, they began to dream about opening their own microbrewery. Several years later, in July of 2012, Senate Bill 2878 became law, raising the permissible alcohol content in Mississippi beer from 5% by weight (6.25%ABV) to 8% by weight (10.1% ABV). The fellas knew that it was high time to start making their dream into a reality. And, they knew that Mississippi was the place to do it.\r\n\r\nIn December of 2013, they purchased a historic building in downtown Gulfport and broke ground for what is now Chandeleur Brewing Company. Their vision is to handcraft some of the most excellent ales on the Gulf Coast using only the finest, freshest malted barley, hops, and local ingredients.","website":"http:\/\/www.chandeleurbrew.com\/","established":"2015","mailingListUrl":"info@chandeleurbrew.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/nJFd7Y\/upload_JJE9yV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/nJFd7Y\/upload_JJE9yV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/nJFd7Y\/upload_JJE9yV-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/nJFd7Y\/upload_JJE9yV-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/nJFd7Y\/upload_JJE9yV-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-08 03:01:40","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:05:40","locations":[{"id":"n7K72G","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2711 14th Street","locality":"Gulfport","region":"Mississippi","postalCode":"39501","phone":"228-701-9985","website":"http:\/\/www.chandeleurbrew.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Thu:  4:00pm - 7:00pm\nFri:  4:00pm - 7:00pm\nSat:  1:00pm - 4:00pm\n\n","latitude":30.367822,"longitude":-89.09537,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2015","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-08 03:01:40","updateDate":"2015-03-13 17:16:03","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"dpvq6g","name":"Freeport BFI (Big Friggin Indian)","nameDisplay":"Freeport BFI (Big Friggin Indian)","styleId":36,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-04-21 12:42:40","updateDate":"2014-10-09 18:35:27","style":{"id":36,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Golden or Blonde Ale","shortName":"Blonde","description":"Golden or Blonde ales are straw to golden blonde in color.

The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery. Goose Island beers are now enjoyed in all 50 states and Europe.","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:46:51","locations":[{"id":"S2n5TB","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1800 West Fulton Street","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60612","phone":"1-800-466-7363","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","latitude":41.887107,"longitude":-87.6720969,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:33:51","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"D2gG2C","name":"Clybourn","streetAddress":"1800 North Clybourn Avenue","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60614","phone":"800-466-7363","latitude":41.9137242,"longitude":-87.65373,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1988","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:32:55","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"isccYz","name":"Fusion Honey","nameDisplay":"Fusion Honey","abv":"6.8","styleId":36,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-08-04 15:53:57","updateDate":"2015-08-04 15:53:57","style":{"id":36,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Golden or Blonde Ale","shortName":"Blonde","description":"Golden or Blonde ales are straw to golden blonde in color.

Within seven months of opening El Toro Brewing Company received its first national recognition at the 1994 Great American Beer Festival (GABF). One of its flagships El Toro Oro Golden Ale won a coveted Gold Medal for English Pale Ale. At the 1996 GABF Poppy Jasper Amber Ale, the brewery's other flagship beer, won a Silver Medal for English Brown Ale. It is a mild yet robust brown ale. The 1997 GABF saw El Toro garner another Gold Medal for the American styled wheat beer named after the brewer's father-in-law, William Jones Wheat Beer.  After 16 years of planning, Geno and Cindy Acevedo of Morgan Hill finally opened a brewpub on November 25 2006. El Toro Brewpub is a two floored building with patio. Inside is the world's only Poppy Jasper Bar. Featuring over 45 feet of gorgeously inlaid and polished Poppy Jasper rock into its surface. To the back of the large mirrored bar you will find over 25 beers and handcrafted sodas on tap. We also have a gleaming copper Pub Brewing system 3 BBL (100 gallon) brewery.

While the name of the company remains Clipper City Brewing Company, all of its beer falls under the Heavy Seas brand. Heavy Seas is located at 4615 Hollins Ferry Road, Suite B, in the Halethorpe section of Baltimore. Heavy Seas currently offers a variety of beer styles in approx. 18 states within the United States.\r\n\r\nHeavy Seas mission is to bring back the local brewery, and to do it in such a way that we are more than just a fringe player, but a positive part of our area. To accomplish this mission we have created a broad portfolio of products with enough diversity that we have at least one beer that can appeal to everyone. Whether your preference is for a classic American style lager beer, or a big, challenging Hop Cubed Ale, we have a something that will suit your taste. We believe in bringing beer drinkers the quality and flavor of a handcrafted beer while supporting the local communities we serve.","website":"http:\/\/www.hsbeer.com\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wTFQaf\/upload_DPoml0-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wTFQaf\/upload_DPoml0-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wTFQaf\/upload_DPoml0-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wTFQaf\/upload_DPoml0-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wTFQaf\/upload_DPoml0-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:43:22","locations":[{"id":"yX6twV","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"4615-B Hollins Ferry Road","locality":"Baltimore","region":"Maryland","postalCode":"21227","phone":"410-247-7822","website":"http:\/\/www.hsbeer.com\/","latitude":39.230827,"longitude":-76.6751309,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2014-11-20 13:52:46","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"vh3ZUn","name":"Heavy Seas Alehouse - Baltimore","streetAddress":"1300 Bank Street","locality":"Baltimore","region":"Maryland","postalCode":"21231","phone":"(410) 753-1403","website":"http:\/\/heavyseasalehouse.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  4:00pm - 12:00am\nTue:  4:00pm - 12:00am\nWed:  4:00pm - 12:00am\nThu:  4:00pm - 12:00am\nFri:  12:00pm - 2:00am\nSat:  12:00pm - 2:00am\nSun:  11:00am - 12:00am\n\n","latitude":39.286626,"longitude":-76.598808,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"restaurant","locationTypeDisplay":"Restaurant\/Ale House","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-05-23 22:13:06","updateDate":"2014-11-20 13:51:07","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"gmfbj6","name":"Heavy Seas Alehouse - Arlington","streetAddress":"1501 Wilson Blvd","locality":"Arlington","region":"Virginia","postalCode":"22209","phone":"(703) 879-4388","website":"http:\/\/heavyseasalehouse.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  11:00am - 12:00am\nTue:  11:00am - 12:00am\nWed:  11:00am - 12:00am\nThu:  11:00am - 12:00am\nFri:  11:00am - 2:00am\nSat:  11:00am - 2:00am\nSun:  11:00am - 12:00am\n\n","latitude":38.8952016,"longitude":-77.0742466,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"restaurant","locationTypeDisplay":"Restaurant\/Ale House","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-11-20 13:52:30","updateDate":"2014-11-20 13:52:46","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"X0y6zH","name":"Gold","nameDisplay":"Gold","availableId":3,"styleId":36,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/X0y6zH\/upload_ef8tJk-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/X0y6zH\/upload_ef8tJk-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/X0y6zH\/upload_ef8tJk-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-06-01 01:43:56","updateDate":"2015-12-17 02:52:25","available":{"id":3,"name":"Not Available","description":"Beer is not available."},"style":{"id":36,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Golden or Blonde Ale","shortName":"Blonde","description":"Golden or Blonde ales are straw to golden blonde in color.
