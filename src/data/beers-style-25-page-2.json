The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery. Goose Island beers are now enjoyed in all 50 states and Europe.","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:46:51","locations":[{"id":"S2n5TB","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1800 West Fulton Street","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60612","phone":"1-800-466-7363","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","latitude":41.887107,"longitude":-87.6720969,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:33:51","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"D2gG2C","name":"Clybourn","streetAddress":"1800 North Clybourn Avenue","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60614","phone":"800-466-7363","latitude":41.9137242,"longitude":-87.65373,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1988","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:32:55","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"0iZobF","name":"360\u00b0Ale","nameDisplay":"360\u00b0Ale","description":"A year round offering based on the similar styles of North American Pale Ale and Amber Ale.

After ending up on the wrong side of the tracks a few times, they were finally pointed in the direction of Virginia-Highlands and found a few bars willing to take a chance on them. \"We'll give you a shot as long as your dog stops begging for leftovers on our patio\" was the cautious approval they needed to get the brand rolling.\r\n\r\nSweetWater's second and current location is in Midtown Atlanta, adjacent to Ansley Park, in the Armour Circle Industrial Park just off of Piedmont and Monroe. The boys saved all of their pennies to buy the 25,000 square feet of brewing goodness and smack in the middle of all the action. Since the company began we've wanted to be closer to our homes, the bars and stores that sell our beer, and all the good folks that drink it. Fortunately seven years of great growth gave the company that opportunity. We learned a lot from that location and left all those mistakes behind as we built our new home. SweetWater Brewing Company has been here since 2004 and it feels good to be settled in.

Brothers Jason and Tom Sobocinski come from a Polish\/Italian family where food and drink is always the focus of every gathering. From Jason\u2019s wedding to his son\u2019s birthdays, roasting a pig has become the favorite way to celebrate any special occasion. Tyler Jones, an old family friend and former brewer of The Portsmouth Brewery in New Hampshire, contacted Jason and Tom with a plan to move to New Haven so his wife and son could be closer to their family. With a plan in the works to form a brewery that would celebrate family and food, they needed to encompass all that they were passionate about. When they celebrate, they roast a hog and the Berkshire hog is the breed of choice, thus Black Hog brewing was born! \r\n\r\nBlack Hog Brewing (BHB) will have a strong tie to local agriculture with a focus on unique craft brews that are pleasant to drink and pair well with foods of all types. Black Hog Brewing will craft year round and seasonal brews with a seasonal Farm Land Series dedicating a percentage of proceeds to support CT Farm Land. 3-4 pig roasts per year, using CT raised Berkshire pigs fed our spent brewing grains will celebrate the release of our seasonal brews. We hope you\u2019ll enjoy Black Hog Brewing Company at one of our pig roasts soon or whatever occasion brings you together for great beer and food with friends and family.","website":"http:\/\/www.blackhogbrewing.com","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/WgTa5f\/upload_KnhGJu-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/WgTa5f\/upload_KnhGJu-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/WgTa5f\/upload_KnhGJu-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/WgTa5f\/upload_KnhGJu-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/WgTa5f\/upload_KnhGJu-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-08-24 01:04:56","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:57:58","locations":[{"id":"LoZU74","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"115 Hurley Rd","extendedAddress":"Bldg 9A","locality":"Oxford","region":"Connecticut","postalCode":"06478","website":"http:\/\/www.blackhogbrewing.com","latitude":41.4757707,"longitude":-73.1520822,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-08-24 01:04:56","updateDate":"2014-08-25 11:53:08","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"5k7LOJ","name":"5 O'Click Shadow - Shinebox","nameDisplay":"5 O'Click Shadow - Shinebox","styleId":25,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-05-06 15:56:51","updateDate":"2014-05-06 15:56:51","style":{"id":25,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"American Pale","description":"American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.

The likely response:\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, I think some dude makes that in his basement or something...\"\r\n\r\nThe word just wasn't getting out, and things didn't look good for the tiny brewery that made exceptionally tasty ales. \r\nWell, a couple of hoodlums in their late-twenties jumped on the opportunity to own and operate their own brewery, and what resulted is the Iron Horse Brewery you know and love today. They tweaked some recipes, changed some names, threw some ridiculous theme parties to encourage locals to actually see the brewery with their own eyes, and good things started to happen. Locals started to dig what the guys were doing.

It is located in the city of Drammen, approximately 25 miles south of our capital, Oslo. You will spot it at the banks of the Drammen River at the very same place as it has been since 1834. The annual production of beer is aprox. 10 mill liter (85 000 barrels), and together with the production of 18 mill liters of soft drinks and mineralwater it gives employment to approximately 150 people.  You may wonder how we got our name ? It was a young fellow with the name Poul Lauritz Aass that bought the brewery in 1860. Since then it has been in the same family, and is today run by the 4th generation of Aass. (By the way - A real Norwegian viking would pronounce it Ouse)  The brewery is proud of its history. To us the quality of what we produce has always been and always will be the main issue. In 1516, Duke Wilhelm of Bavaria established a law admitting only malted barley, hops yeast, and water as ingredients in the production of beer. The law is known as the purity law and Aass Brewery is still loyal to Duke Wilhelm of Bavaria. In Norway the brewery is known for outstanding quality and large number of different beer types.","website":"http:\/\/www.aass.no","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TGtEbk\/upload_rooKoF-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TGtEbk\/upload_rooKoF-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TGtEbk\/upload_rooKoF-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TGtEbk\/upload_rooKoF-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TGtEbk\/upload_rooKoF-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:43","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:38:13","locations":[{"id":"gaVq6l","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Ole Steensgt. 10 Postboks 1530","locality":"Drammen","phone":"47-32-26-60-00","website":"http:\/\/www.aass.no","latitude":59.7440738,"longitude":10.2044564,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"NO","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:43","updateDate":"2015-11-20 18:30:48","country":{"isoCode":"NO","name":"NORWAY","displayName":"Norway","isoThree":"NOR","numberCode":578,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"u5I4LT","name":"Absolom's Ale","nameDisplay":"Absolom's Ale","description":"Light bodied, clean, crisp tasting yet has a bit of character.

Having been raised on both sides of the border, we always enjoyed eating from both cultures.  Mexican Street Tacos, chile enfused candies, enchiladas one day, and Hamburgers, mac and cheese and ding dongs the next. As adults we realized how unique being raised on the border was, how the mix of flavors was seeping from north to south, and south to north. It was this fusion in flavors that inspired to take traditional, European brewing traditions and infuse the process with a whole new palette of Latin American ingredients.  So we dug into our own roots for inspiration and found a treasure trove of brewing traditions, ingredients and unique flavors.  Our best example of this is our Blood Saison, an agave and Hibiscus infused Saison that come off sweet initially, middle tartness and finishing like a beer.","website":"http:\/\/www.borderxbrewing.com\/","established":"2013","mailingListUrl":"info@borderxbrewing.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/dx6426\/upload_OyXAX9-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/dx6426\/upload_OyXAX9-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/dx6426\/upload_OyXAX9-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/dx6426\/upload_OyXAX9-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/dx6426\/upload_OyXAX9-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-16 00:07:12","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:04:57","locations":[{"id":"IDHs4u","name":"Logan Tasting Room","streetAddress":"2181 Logan Ave","locality":"San Diego","region":"California","postalCode":"92113","phone":"6194310771","website":"http:\/\/www.borderxbrewing.com","hoursOfOperation":"Wed:  2:00pm - 8:00pm\r\nThu:  2:00pm - 8:00pm\r\nFri:  2:00pm - 11:00pm\r\nSat:  2:00pm - 11:00pm\r\nSun:  2:00pm - 6:00pm","latitude":32.6981297,"longitude":-117.1397481,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"restaurant","locationTypeDisplay":"Restaurant\/Ale House","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-16 00:07:12","updateDate":"2015-11-18 21:16:23","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"cRLX8x","name":"Otay Brewery","streetAddress":"8684 Avenida De La Fuente Ste 8","locality":"San Diego","region":"California","postalCode":"92154","phone":"6194310771","website":"http:\/\/www.borderxbrewing.com\/","latitude":32.5566393,"longitude":-116.9567988,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-18 16:21:01","updateDate":"2015-06-15 19:18:10","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"FvKCPH","name":"Accolades in the Pacific","nameDisplay":"Accolades in the Pacific","styleId":25,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/FvKCPH\/upload_fc7tEO-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/FvKCPH\/upload_fc7tEO-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/FvKCPH\/upload_fc7tEO-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-12-05 12:46:27","updateDate":"2015-12-17 08:05:24","style":{"id":25,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"American Pale","description":"American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.

The Simcoe\/Citra combination of hops present heady fruit\r\nnotes, which are amplified through the dry-hopping, producing intense flavour and aromas without the additional bitterness. That said, there's a decent bitterness providing a sharpness, but is moderated and perfectly balanced by the subtle toffee sweetness from the malts and tropical fruit flavours.","abv":"5.4","styleId":25,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/BcrYem\/upload_Xr56iU-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/BcrYem\/upload_Xr56iU-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/BcrYem\/upload_Xr56iU-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-02-17 18:41:15","updateDate":"2015-12-17 10:43:43","style":{"id":25,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"American Pale","description":"American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.
