It is located in the city of Drammen, approximately 25 miles south of our capital, Oslo. You will spot it at the banks of the Drammen River at the very same place as it has been since 1834. The annual production of beer is aprox. 10 mill liter (85 000 barrels), and together with the production of 18 mill liters of soft drinks and mineralwater it gives employment to approximately 150 people.  You may wonder how we got our name ? It was a young fellow with the name Poul Lauritz Aass that bought the brewery in 1860. Since then it has been in the same family, and is today run by the 4th generation of Aass. (By the way - A real Norwegian viking would pronounce it Ouse)  The brewery is proud of its history. To us the quality of what we produce has always been and always will be the main issue. In 1516, Duke Wilhelm of Bavaria established a law admitting only malted barley, hops yeast, and water as ingredients in the production of beer. The law is known as the purity law and Aass Brewery is still loyal to Duke Wilhelm of Bavaria. In Norway the brewery is known for outstanding quality and large number of different beer types.","website":"http:\/\/www.aass.no","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TGtEbk\/upload_rooKoF-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TGtEbk\/upload_rooKoF-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TGtEbk\/upload_rooKoF-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TGtEbk\/upload_rooKoF-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TGtEbk\/upload_rooKoF-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:43","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:38:13","locations":[{"id":"gaVq6l","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Ole Steensgt. 10 Postboks 1530","locality":"Drammen","phone":"47-32-26-60-00","website":"http:\/\/www.aass.no","latitude":59.7440738,"longitude":10.2044564,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"NO","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:43","updateDate":"2015-11-20 18:30:48","country":{"isoCode":"NO","name":"NORWAY","displayName":"Norway","isoThree":"NOR","numberCode":578,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"wDygv1","name":"Clearwater Light","nameDisplay":"Clearwater Light","description":"Named after the original Hops, Clearwater Light is a remarkably clear and light beer that will appeal to American beer drinkers.","availableId":1,"styleId":97,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:00","updateDate":"2015-11-12 21:04:03","available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":97,"categoryId":8,"category":{"id":8,"name":"North American Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"American-Style Premium Lager","shortName":"American Premium Lager","description":"This style has low malt (and adjunct) sweetness, is medium bodied, and should contain no or a low percentage (less than 25%) of adjuncts.

This Golden Lager delivers the full flavor of a fine import or craft beer, but with a great deal more drinkability. \r\n\r\nOur Golden Lager recipe combines the finest Colorado-grown hops with our prized Moravian two-row barley from the San Luis Valley. Each brew begins with a slow and easy 90-minute boil. Select Colorado-grown hops are added to build taste complexities and balance the malt sweetness.  After fermentation, each brew is crash-cooled to 1\u00b0 Celsius and allowed to rest (lager) for up to four weeks. This Chill-lagering develops each brew into a perfectly balanced, deep golden-copper lager that is appreciated for its unmistakable crisp, clean finish.  \r\nBecause of the extra time required to brew, age and package Colorado Native Golden Lager, it take us longer to craft this beer \u2013 we believe you will agree\u2026\u2026..it\u2019s worth the wait.","abv":"5.7","ibu":"27","glasswareId":5,"availableId":1,"styleId":97,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/Iw4eWa\/upload_qMxlJT-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/Iw4eWa\/upload_qMxlJT-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/Iw4eWa\/upload_qMxlJT-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-09-18 20:00:02","updateDate":"2015-12-18 05:17:16","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":97,"categoryId":8,"category":{"id":8,"name":"North American Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"American-Style Premium Lager","shortName":"American Premium Lager","description":"This style has low malt (and adjunct) sweetness, is medium bodied, and should contain no or a low percentage (less than 25%) of adjuncts.
