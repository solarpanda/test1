The brewery addition was added back in 1994 but operated quietly as Oregon\u2019s smallest micobrewery for many years. With the more recent additions of David Vohden and Cameron Moore, we have refocused our efforts on producing and sharing a constantly changing lineup of fresh quality beers from right here in the Great Pacific Northwest. Vohden oversees all brewery operations which he has met with great success. Most recently of which was a Silver Medal for our Woozy Weizenbock at the Great American Beer Festival. We see our recent efforts bringing exciting results.\r\n\r\nWe reached completion of a 3,500 sq ft. addition to expand our brew house in the Summer of 2013. Vohden and Moore finished installation of the glycol system just in time to quench the thirsty demands of the 2013 Oregon Brewers Festival with a crowd pleasing Traverse Cherry Wit Bier. In addition to the brew house expansion we have added four 7-barrel fermentation tanks for an eventual all around 7-barrel system upgrade. A Cellar was also added for barrel aging, sours, and other delectable experiments.\r\n\r\nAlthough most of the square footage was utilized for brewing purposes. We were sure to save some space for all you beer drinkers. A mezzanine gives an elevated view down onto the open brewery floor. If you happen to drop by on a brew day you too can enjoy the sweet sensory overload and watch the action (or lack thereof). A beautiful black walnut bar, fully stocked with 13 drafts faucets was added to accompany the additional seating area and to cater to private events. However, the new bar and brewery seating are always open to patrons except in the case of private events. Another 60\u2032 TV was added to the new mezzanine area and we continue to play all major sporting events.

Cheers.","website":"http:\/\/www.hangar24brewery.com\/","established":"2008","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/peXEgv\/upload_Ypg9BV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/peXEgv\/upload_Ypg9BV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/peXEgv\/upload_Ypg9BV-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/peXEgv\/upload_Ypg9BV-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/peXEgv\/upload_Ypg9BV-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:08:01","locations":[{"id":"883Pwt","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1710 Sessums Drive","locality":"Redlands","region":"California","postalCode":"92374","phone":"909-389-1400","website":"http:\/\/www.hangar24brewery.com\/","latitude":34.082555,"longitude":-117.13932,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"0bPafp","name":"Ryedalong","nameDisplay":"Ryedalong","abv":"6.7","styleId":41,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/0bPafp\/upload_cWWQA9-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/0bPafp\/upload_cWWQA9-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/0bPafp\/upload_cWWQA9-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-07-21 12:05:16","updateDate":"2015-12-17 15:09:43","style":{"id":41,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Black Ale","shortName":"Black Ale","description":"American-style Black Ales are very dark to black and perceived to have medium high to high hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content, balanced with a medium body.
