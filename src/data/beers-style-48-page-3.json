Mike, Nick, and Anthony had been avid home brewers and craft beer enthusiasts for years before they finally decided to turn their shared passion into a full time gig.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, the three friends quit their day jobs and opened a restaurant that quickly became known as a mecca for craft beer enthusiasts in Vancouver.  As the restaurant business thrived, the guys turned their attentions back to the enduring dream of opening their own brewery.\r\n\r\nThe guys decided that it was time to stop talking and start brewing.  They teamed up with Graham With, a respected home brewer; and Michael Tod, a friend with a wealth of sales experience in the BC craft beer industry.  The newly assembled Parallel 49 team set out to create the unique brand of Vancouver craft beer that they had been thirsting after for years.","website":"http:\/\/parallel49brewing.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/oZ1O3I\/upload_P8kxtU-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/oZ1O3I\/upload_P8kxtU-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/oZ1O3I\/upload_P8kxtU-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/oZ1O3I\/upload_P8kxtU-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/oZ1O3I\/upload_P8kxtU-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-07 23:41:01","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:42:43","locations":[{"id":"Ixo7Nb","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1950 Triumph St","locality":"Vancouver","region":"British Columbia","postalCode":"V5L 1K5","phone":"(604) 558-2739","website":"http:\/\/parallel49brewing.com","hoursOfOperation":"Open from Noon - 9pm daily","latitude":49.2839053,"longitude":-123.0644391,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"CA","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-09 15:52:39","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"CA","name":"CANADA","displayName":"Canada","isoThree":"CAN","numberCode":124,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"tSAIVF","name":"Cali Weiz Guy","nameDisplay":"Cali Weiz Guy","description":"Get the best of both worlds in this delicious blend of Yoshi's Nectar (California Common Style) and Hefeweizen (German Wheat).

Since that day we are brewing the Calwer-Eck-Br\u00e4u following our own recipe. It is a bottom-fermented, natural cloudy beer, fresh from the cave. Although it is strongly liable to the German Purity Law dated 1516 it is different to most other beers, since we are not filtering or pasteurizing it but bring it directly from the brewery to your table.\r\n\r\nIn order to make your stay a most pleasant one, we serve homemade Swabian delicacies with the freshly brewed beer. You can have a look on our traditional micro brewery directly from your seat in the restaurant and you can join a guided tour upon appointment. There are no separate rooms in our pleasant and friendly pub but we\u00b4ll be pleased to reserve the requested number of seats for you in one of our most comfortable places of the pub to make your stay with your friends or collegues most enjoyable.\r\n\r\nIf you come with a larger group of people you have the opportunity to rent the whole restaurant where we will spoil you with our speciality buffets. It will be a pleasure to help you with the combination of your menue and to create the right atmosphere for your stay. Our catering service will bring our home-made delicacies to ever place you want.

In 2002 Denison's Wheat Beer became rated #1 in the world in the 'German Hefeweizen' category on ratebeer.com, and has remained in that place to this date. \r\n\r\nDenison's Weissbier is true to style, served unfiltered and is very refreshing.

They also take time to push the limits of brewing with the \"Brick Mason\" series, which the staff sees as their continuing masterpiece. Highlights from this series include \"The Lost Years\" old ale, \"Black-Eye Rye\" American black ale, and the most recent release \"20th Anniversary\", a 10% Imperial stout that was aged in Buffalo Trace bourbon barrels. Early accolades have already compared it to the hallowed KBS.\r\n\r\nThe future keeps looking brighter and brighter for this brewery, and the next couple years will see them growing and experimenting with diverse styles, collaborating with fellow breweries, implementing a new barrel program, and continuing to raise the bar for themselves in all aspects.
