A labor of love in which long brew days in the garage, bad equipment, curious dogs (we still blame them for a bad batch or two) and hanging out with friends became commonplace. Once it took root, this hobby turned into a passion (along with some really solid beers).\r\n\r\nWe took our wares to football games, parties, and cookouts. Before too long, folks began requesting our beer. It\u2019s pretty fun to have someone you don\u2019t even know walk right smack dab up to you and tell you how much they like your beer. We didn\u2019t set out to start a business, the business just found us. \r\n\r\n\u201cOnce in a while you get shown the light in the strangest of places if you look at it right\u201d Robert Hunter\r\n\r\nWe wanted to brew our beer and create something that would make our families, friends, community, and ourselves proud in what we were doing. We wanted to give back and help support those that helped support us.  We wanted to represent the unique qualities of the South that make us proud to be southerners. \r\n\r\nGood People Brewing Company seemed like the perfect fit.  Good People describes the kind, humble, concerned, and respected folks all throughout the South, no matter if your speaking singularly or plurally. That is what we strive for here at Good People Brewing Company\u2026.to be good people. \r\n\r\nIn September of 2007, we acquired our equipment and started getting our brewery put together. It was a long, frustrating, and tiring process\u2026.but it was flat worth every bit of it all.\r\n\r\nSo if you are looking for something made in small batches with high quality ingredients and pride, please give us a shot.\r\n\r\nThe Brewery\r\nWe brew on a two kettle, combi-tank and brew kettle, 20 bbl system manufactured by New World Systems.

During that time, Rob cultivated his passion and skill for homebrewing and received an Associates Degree in Brewing Science from the Siebel Institute.  Then, with full support from Ali, he started an invaluable internship at Port Jeff Brewing Company in Long Island. \r\n\r\nIt was a long commute from Brooklyn, and even longer work hours, but Rob's love for brewing only grew. His passion rubbed off on Ali, who had over the years become a self-professed beer snob, and she began reading up on the business side of brewing. Eventually it became clear that the two would open their own brewery.  They started scouting out the perfect locale for their business and stopped when they found the blossoming town of Derry, NH, in Ali\u2019s home state.","website":"http:\/\/www.rockinghambrewing.com\/","established":"2015","mailingListUrl":"info@rockinghambrewing.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/CQkJER\/upload_inslR1-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/CQkJER\/upload_inslR1-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/CQkJER\/upload_inslR1-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/CQkJER\/upload_inslR1-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/CQkJER\/upload_inslR1-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-27 21:04:54","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:07:02","locations":[{"id":"HW6qMZ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"One Corporate Park Drive #1","locality":"Derry","region":"New Hampshire","postalCode":"03038","phone":"(603) 216-2324","website":"http:\/\/www.rockinghambrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Thu:  3:00pm - 7:00pm\nFri:  3:00pm - 7:00pm\nSat:  1:00pm - 7:00pm\n\n","latitude":42.8858758,"longitude":-71.3358808,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"nano","locationTypeDisplay":"Nano Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2015","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-27 21:09:27","updateDate":"2015-04-20 12:37:14","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"cskkkK","name":"Berserker","nameDisplay":"Berserker","abv":"10","ibu":"69.9","styleId":43,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/cskkkK\/upload_3a06fs-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/cskkkK\/upload_3a06fs-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/cskkkK\/upload_3a06fs-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-03 21:35:43","updateDate":"2015-12-17 11:03:00","style":{"id":43,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Imperial Stout","shortName":"American Imperial Stout","description":"Black in color, American-style imperial stouts typically have a high alcohol content.
