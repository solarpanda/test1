And we lager all of our beers in horizontal tanks for a cleaner, crisper finish. \r\n\r\nPenn Brewery is housed in the mid-nineteenth century landmark E&O Brewery building and is one of only a handful of working breweries with original beer caves still on premise.

A reliable place from which we launch into the world, and enjoy a safe return.\r\n\r\nWe hang out in our garages. Saturday mornings, afternoons, long into the night. Sometimes hosting neighbors, family and friends, other times in blissful solitude, tinkering on projects, obsessing over a problem or making something great. Think of the garages in your past. You\u2019ll remember your dad fishing a lawnmower or building a table, where he taught you to say \u201cYes, sir.\u201d You can almost smell the oil and beer.\r\n\r\nBut more and more the family garage is an incubator, an enterprise zone. It\u2019s part of the beautiful renaissance happening in the middle of this great country. So it was for Evan Rouse. Evan, from Union, Kentucky, was a pretty extraordinary kid. Because while other kids played video games and started garage bands, Evan fell in love with the craft of brewing beer. And he built a home brewery in the family garage. He was just 16 years old, not even of age.\r\n\r\nFor Evan, brewing beer was more than an idea, it was a revolution. Because from that humble start, Evan\u2019s love for brewing has become his entrepreneurial obsession. He\u2019s building the brewery of his dreams. And his entire family is on board, helping him get it done. (The truth is, it\u2019s a pretty extraordinary family.)\r\n\r\nSo welcome to Braxton Brewing Company. You\u2019re witnessing a dream coming to life. A place where ideas are born and fermented. It\u2019s a great deal of work, but hell, that\u2019s what makes a dream worth pursuing. This brewery celebrates determination, knowledge, and the humble pride we wave like a battle flag.","website":"http:\/\/www.braxtonbrewing.com","established":"2014","mailingListUrl":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/BraxtonBrewingCompany\/app_100265896690345?ref=page_internal","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ADokcx\/upload_uhwjxL-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ADokcx\/upload_uhwjxL-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ADokcx\/upload_uhwjxL-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ADokcx\/upload_uhwjxL-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ADokcx\/upload_uhwjxL-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-06-09 16:09:40","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:10:04","locations":[{"id":"JZyJiP","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"27 W. 7th","locality":"Covington","region":"Kentucky","postalCode":"41011","phone":"859-261-5600","website":"www.braxtonbrewing.com","latitude":39.0829077,"longitude":-84.5109181,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-06-15 17:33:55","updateDate":"2016-03-22 15:26:30","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"H1Jpnc","name":"Speckled Trout","nameDisplay":"Speckled Trout","glasswareId":5,"styleId":113,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/H1Jpnc\/upload_lxJqcJ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/H1Jpnc\/upload_lxJqcJ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/H1Jpnc\/upload_lxJqcJ-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-01-03 12:21:43","updateDate":"2015-12-16 23:28:51","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"style":{"id":113,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Light American Wheat Ale or Lager without Yeast","shortName":"Wheat Ale","description":"This beer can be made using either ale or lager yeast.

Armed with a we can do this attitude the three cast off from their careers in engineering and biology to found the Wachusett Brewing Co. in 1993. Wachusett Country Ale was introduced to beer fans of Massachusetts the next year after lots of experimenting to get the formula just right. When Wachusett opened, the three designed and built most of the equipment; did the brewing and filling, selling and delivering, and everything else that a small startup brewery needed. Ned, Kevin and Peter are now backed by some of the most passionate and capable co-workers in the industry. Wachusett Ales continue to be hand crafted with the finest ingredients available, bottled and kegged in our Westminster facility. The three have never strayed from their plan to brew and sell the freshest, highest quality beers possible.","website":"http:\/\/www.wachusettbrew.com\/","established":"1994","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/DifSi4\/upload_Inrdpl-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/DifSi4\/upload_Inrdpl-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/DifSi4\/upload_Inrdpl-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/DifSi4\/upload_Inrdpl-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/DifSi4\/upload_Inrdpl-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:12","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:02:05","locations":[{"id":"NbGMT2","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"175 State Road East","locality":"Westminster","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"01473","phone":"978-874-9965","website":"http:\/\/www.wachusettbrew.com\/","latitude":42.558624,"longitude":-71.8715256,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1994","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:12","updateDate":"2014-09-26 14:00:00","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"JI373Y","name":"Summer Brew","nameDisplay":"Summer Brew","abv":"7.2","styleId":113,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-03 17:39:45","updateDate":"2014-09-07 16:55:42","style":{"id":113,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Light American Wheat Ale or Lager without Yeast","shortName":"Wheat Ale","description":"This beer can be made using either ale or lager yeast.

Because this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"35","abvMin":"3.8","abvMax":"5","srmMin":"2","srmMax":"10","ogMin":"1.036","fgMin":"1.004","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:42:53"},"breweries":[{"id":"T3I6jH","name":"Shipwrecked Restaurant and Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Shipwrecked Restaurant","description":"Welcome to Shipwrecked Restaurant, Brew Pub & Inn, Door County\u2019s Only Microbrewery!\r\n\r\nStop in for one of our hand crafted ales while you\u2019re in Egg Harbor or ask for 6 packs at your favorite retailers throughout Northeastern Wisconsin.","website":"http:\/\/www.shipwreckedmicrobrew.com\/","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:57:52","locations":[{"id":"sllA8V","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"7791 Egg Harbor Road","locality":"Egg Harbor","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"54209","phone":"888-868-2767","website":"http:\/\/www.shipwreckedmicrobrew.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"OPEN EVERY DAY:\r\nMay - October\r\n\r\nOPEN WEEKENDS ONLY:\r\nNovember - April","latitude":45.0494932,"longitude":-87.2802481,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
