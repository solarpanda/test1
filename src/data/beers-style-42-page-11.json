After returning to the states, they had trouble finding that type of beer in Chicago so they opened Two Brothers Brewing Company in 1996. To get them started, the brothers' grandfather, a retired dairy farmer, donated his bulk milk tanks, which were quickly converted to fermenters. Currently, the brewery resides in a 40,000 square foot facility 30 miles west of Chicago. In addition to their traditional style beers, Two Brothers Brewing Company produces many specialty beers including the Project Opus Sour series. Adjacent to the brewery, Two Brothers Tap House opened in 2008 as a restaurant which serves elevated, seasonal, and organic American pub fare. In 2011, the Ebel brothers purchased Walter Payton's Roundhouse located in Aurora, IL. The Two Brothers Roundhouse is a full service brewpub restaurant, music venue, offers banquet space for large parties and weddings and hosts the Two Brothers Cafe and Beer Bar! \r\n\r\nTwo Brothers Brewing Company's award winning products are currently available in Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Florida, New York, Iowa and Missouri.","website":"http:\/\/www.TwoBrothersBrewing.com\/","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Cu5xXG\/upload_FFc22Y-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Cu5xXG\/upload_FFc22Y-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Cu5xXG\/upload_FFc22Y-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Cu5xXG\/upload_FFc22Y-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Cu5xXG\/upload_FFc22Y-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:01:21","locations":[{"id":"jeOXxz","name":"Two Brothers Tap House","streetAddress":"30 w 315 Calumet Ave.","locality":"Warrenville","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60555","phone":"630.393.2337","website":"http:\/\/www.twobrotherstaphouse.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday        3:00 - 11:00\r\nTuesday        3:00 - 11:00\r\nWednesday   3:00 - 11:00\r\nThursday      3:00 - 11:00\r\nFriday         12:00 - 12:00\r\nSaturday     12:00 - 12:00\r\nSunday        12:00 - 9:00","latitude":41.824453,"longitude":-88.212512,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2015-07-14 13:53:02","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"YOdPoo","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"30W315 Calumet Ave.","locality":"Warrenville","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60555","website":"http:\/\/www.twobrosbrew.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"We are give tours EVERY Saturday at 1:00 and 2:30 and Sunday at 1:00.","latitude":41.824906,"longitude":-88.211221,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2012-01-26 12:57:18","updateDate":"2015-07-07 21:22:36","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"AiMDyF","name":"Two Brothers Roundhouse","streetAddress":"205 N.

The original Downtown location opened in November 1994 and expanded with the addition of a pool hall in 1996. The wild success of the first Great Dane led to the decision to open more pubs in the Madison area.\r\n\r\nThe Fitchburg Great Dane began operations in 2002 and the Hilldale pub followed in 2006. In 2009, the Hilldale pub expanded its brewery and opened a 4,000 square foot pool hall. Additionally, in May of 2009, the first Great Dane outside of the Madison area debuted in Wausau, Wisconsin. The Wausau Great Dane added a 100 seat beer garden and outdoor bar in the spring of 2011. In November 2010, the fifth Great Dane began operations in Grandview commons, off of Cottage Grove Road on Madison's east side.","website":"http:\/\/www.greatdanepub.com\/","established":"1996","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/www.greatdanepub.com\/email-list-signup","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/fonllb\/upload_6QtrPl-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/fonllb\/upload_6QtrPl-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/fonllb\/upload_6QtrPl-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/fonllb\/upload_6QtrPl-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/fonllb\/upload_6QtrPl-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:47:09","locations":[{"id":"IdIInN","name":"Fitchburg","streetAddress":"2980 Cahill Main","locality":"Fitchburg","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"53711","phone":"608-442-9000","website":"http:\/\/fitchburg.greatdanepub.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday- Thursday 11AM-2AM, Friday-Saturday 11AM-230AM, Sunday 10AM-2AM","latitude":43.0177229,"longitude":-89.423194,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"restaurant","locationTypeDisplay":"Restaurant\/Ale House","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"ux16wo","name":"Downtown","streetAddress":"123 E.

Our brewery is a modern, 15-barrel brew house capable of making up to 3,000 barrels of beer per year.

We opened on March 25, 2011. The restaurant serves lunch and dinner with approximately 90 seats inside plus 35 seats of outside patio dining. We offer family friendly dining with a children\u2019s play area, as well as a private meeting room for business gatherings and presentations or private events, all within full view of our own brewery.  \r\n\r\nThe restaurant is very much \u201cfarm-to-fork,\u201d working closely with North Carolina pasture raised beef farmers supplying beef with no hormones added and antibiotic-free meat that we grind daily to make our hamburgers and all-beef hotdogs.  We work with other farmers growing vegetables such as tomatoes, cucumbers for pickles, and lettuce. The menu is streamlined with most items produced on-site including house made buns, sauerkraut and bacon. We use no artificial sweeteners, no high fructose corn syrup, and no hydrogenated oils.  We like to say we are like fine dining in a burger joint.  We make the mustard, the slaw, the pickles, the mayo, the aioli, the hotdogs, the relish, the...\r\n\r\nWe are also a full scale working brewery and brew our own beer.  We have up to eight beers on-tap at any given time creating fresh ales and lagers rotating seasonally throughout the year. We use just malt, hops, yeast and water to craft our beer, leaving out adjuncts and additives. We take wine seriously and feature farmer made, estate grown and bottled wines from around the world, which are served on-tap via the Enomatic self-serve wine-dispensing machine.\r\n\r\nCentral to Bull City Burger and Brewery\u2019s core values is sustainability; our attempt is to operate while leaving the smallest energy footprint possible.  Our long term goal is to become part of a cycle of energy with the restaurant playing an integral role in the farms we source. Grain left over from the brewing process will feed locally farmed pigs that provide pork bellies to make our bacon, and the fry oil will become bio-diesel to fuel vehicles.","website":"http:\/\/www.bullcityburgerandbrewery.com\/","established":"2011","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/visitor.r20.constantcontact.com\/manage\/optin\/ea?v=001qie9IeSPzo4U1KgkEFG5EQ%3D%3D","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/eu1cAn\/upload_OCIvTW-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/eu1cAn\/upload_OCIvTW-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/eu1cAn\/upload_OCIvTW-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/eu1cAn\/upload_OCIvTW-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/eu1cAn\/upload_OCIvTW-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:12:44","locations":[{"id":"vGotFH","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"107 East Parrish Street","extendedAddress":"Suite 105","locality":"Durham","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"27701","phone":"919-680-2333","website":"http:\/\/www.bullcityburgerandbrewery.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday - Thursday: 11:11am to 10pm\r\nFriday & Saturday:  11:11am to 11pm-ish\r\nClosed Sundays","latitude":35.995445,"longitude":-78.899939,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"V9x9qv","name":"Jackalope Coffee Stout","nameDisplay":"Jackalope Coffee Stout","styleId":42,"isOrganic":"Y","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-07-14 21:23:22","updateDate":"2015-07-14 21:23:22","style":{"id":42,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Stout","shortName":"American Stout","description":"Initial low to medium malt sweetness with a degree of caramel, chocolate and\/or roasted coffee flavor with a distinctive dryroasted bitterness in the finish.
