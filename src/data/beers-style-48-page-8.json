The youngest of six in a family of caterers, he may have it in his genes to provide others with food and drink, and the early experiments proved a hit at weekly parties on Missoula's University Avenue. Dan tried his hand at the homebrew standards--stouts, porters, English-style ales, etc.--but also made a mean hefeweizen (no lemon, please), alt, marzen, dunkel, and other Continental styles. Since moving to Portland in 2001, he's quenched the thirst of friends, neighbors and guests--not just college partygoers but beer geeks who live in Beervana for a reason. After a slight detour for law school and the cat-herding world of criminal defense, Dan swapped his back-porch setup for a bigger set of kettles and fermenters.","website":"http:\/\/occidentalbrewing.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:04","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:26:35","locations":[{"id":"5qaoia","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"6635 N.

It largely served sailors of the Great Lakes during the booming days of logging in Western Michigan.\r\nIn 1892 a second structure with decorative cast iron columns was added.(Now, entrance to Sunset Bay Antiques.) It served as the lobby of the Central House Hotel and provided a dining room, upstairs parlor rooms and additional bedrooms.\r\nIn 1905 the final four storefronts were added to provide apartments for the employees of the recently completed Star Watch Case Co., then located on nearby Rath Street.

Linus and Lila Hall moved to Nashville from Mississippi in 1996, with Linus going to work as a tire engineer for Bridgestone and Lila as a curator for the Parthenon. Trying to make tires more round proved to be less fulfilling than making great beer, so with the encouragement of Lila, Linus quit his job, got a business degree from Vanderbilt and a craft-brewing education through a course at the American Brewer's Guild, and did an internship under Garrett Oliver at Brooklyn Brewery. Linus found a used 10 bbl brewing system from a brewpub in Iowa that had gone out of business, and went to work restoring a corner of the old Marathon Motorworks building for their brewery. Yazoo Brewing opened for business in Oct 2003, and quickly gained an enthusiastic local following.","website":"http:\/\/www.yazoobrew.com\/","established":"2003","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gUJBgl\/upload_Gxo9kQ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gUJBgl\/upload_Gxo9kQ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gUJBgl\/upload_Gxo9kQ-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gUJBgl\/upload_Gxo9kQ-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gUJBgl\/upload_Gxo9kQ-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:13","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:03:13","locations":[{"id":"preZog","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"910 Division St","locality":"Nashville","region":"Tennessee","postalCode":"37203","phone":"615-891-4649","website":"http:\/\/www.yazoobrew.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Thu:  4:00pm - 8:00pm\nFri:  4:00pm - 8:00pm\nSat:  2:00pm - 8:00pm\nWed:  4:00pm - 6:00pm\n\nWednesday are Growler fills only","latitude":36.1509754,"longitude":-86.7821302,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2003","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:13","updateDate":"2014-08-23 15:00:53","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"wqcg0X","name":"Hefeweizen","nameDisplay":"Hefeweizen","styleId":48,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:21","updateDate":"2012-03-22 13:04:48","style":{"id":48,"categoryId":4,"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"South German-Style Hefeweizen \/ Hefeweissbier","shortName":"Hefeweizen","description":"The aroma and flavor of a Weissbier with yeast is decidedly fruity and phenolic.

Being a farmer, he even started growing corn and other vegetables for them. One day, Larry's father showed up with a bushel of live crabs and left them with Dani to sell. The crabs sold so fast that they picked up more crabs, shrimp, and other types of seafood too. In 1994, Mr. Walters passed away and Dani and Larry had to move on to bigger and better things. They rented a space in the Chalfont Village Shopping Center and opened a restaurant and fresh fish market. Dani and Larry did all the cooking. Larry would go to the fish market daily to ensure the freshest seafood. And with the help of loyal family and friends, Jones Family Seafood became a popular seafood restaurant in the area.\r\n    Early in 2001, Larry received a mailing, the kind we all ignore, advertising \"Brew your own beer\". He was immediately hooked. After convincing Dani that this was a good idea, they met up with a \"brew master\", ordered the equipment, and they were on their way.","website":"http:\/\/www.crabbylarrys.com\/","established":"1990","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/m6aqF7\/upload_NiSbcP-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/m6aqF7\/upload_NiSbcP-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/m6aqF7\/upload_NiSbcP-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/m6aqF7\/upload_NiSbcP-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/m6aqF7\/upload_NiSbcP-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:43:48","locations":[{"id":"WtMfgN","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"237 West Butler Avenue","locality":"Chalfont","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"18914","phone":"215-822-8788","website":"http:\/\/www.crabbylarrys.com\/","latitude":40.2795364,"longitude":-75.2143123,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1990","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2015-10-19 17:09:38","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"eUTgWQ","name":"Hefeweizen","nameDisplay":"Hefeweizen","description":"An authentic Bavarian-style unfiltered wheat beer.
