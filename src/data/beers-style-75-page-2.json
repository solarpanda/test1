At Uinta, we have replicated a true old world pilsner by using the finest imported Saaz hops and then aging this golden lager for nearly a month. The aging process creates a smooth, mellow flavor that gives it a remarkable drinkability. Enjoy the delicate balance between the flowery hops and the assertive malt flavors.\r\n\r\nWhere did the name come from? Uinta embraced the concept of renewable energy in 2001 by committing to 100% wind powered energy. The name Blue Sky Pilsner stems from that commitment.\r\n\r\nTASTING NOTES:\r\nMalty taste and generously hopped. Citrus highlights. Finishes crisp and dry. Blue Sky pairs well with spicy food, and dishes such as chicken satay and grilled sausages. Try it with cheeses such as havarti, muenster, and monterey jack.","abv":"4","ibu":"22","glasswareId":5,"srmId":4,"availableId":3,"styleId":75,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/y0too2\/upload_eO6gZZ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/y0too2\/upload_eO6gZZ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/y0too2\/upload_eO6gZZ-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:52","updateDate":"2015-12-16 06:07:03","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"srm":{"id":4,"name":"4","hex":"FFBF42"},"available":{"id":3,"name":"Not Available","description":"Beer is not available."},"style":{"id":75,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"German-Style Pilsener","shortName":"German Pilsener","description":"A classic German Pilsener is very light straw or golden in color and well hopped.

The use of German hops for bittering creates an assertive clean, crisp bitterness.

In the 1840\u2019s, the pilsner style emerged from central Europe to become the world\u2019s most popular style of beer. Like its ancestors, Brooklyn Pilsner is traditionally brewed from the finest German two-row barley malts. Germangrown Perle and Hallertauer hops provide a crisp, snappy bitterness and fresh, floral aroma. The flavor of the malt comes through in the finish. We ferment Brooklyn Pilsner at cool temperatures, and then give it a long, gentle maturation (lagering), which results in a beer of superior complexity and smoothness. We believe that you will find there to be none finer. Unlike mass-marketed so-called pilsners, Brooklyn Pilsner does not contain cheap fillers such as corn or rice, nor does it contain any preservatives or stabilizers. Brooklyn Pilsner is the real thing.","abv":"5.1","ibu":"33","glasswareId":4,"availableId":1,"styleId":75,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/8II2YO\/upload_jsGSVu-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/8II2YO\/upload_jsGSVu-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/8II2YO\/upload_jsGSVu-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"Brooklyn Pilsner is a very versatile beer which will pair well with a wide variety of foods.

We invite you to enjoy one of our beers in our brewery or take some home for a true Capital experience.\r\n\r\n\r\nCapital Brewery was established with an important mission in mind, and we continually build on that sentiment, by delivering a unique experience and award winning beers to meet the changing demands of the craft beer community.","website":"http:\/\/www.capitalbrewery.com\/","established":"1984","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/visitor.r20.constantcontact.com\/manage\/optin?v=001QKOUjm76P7aUowbU3bchMmLlIKSnJ2dJN7B3SnkK1I-Dde4Q3J1O8o_MbR3cMmc9UYntPMmGLsuW8he0ZzVEDAGaJ2Jp9MbLzBs7xf-IS0iQq4FuDhj02K5Wn2ywuNqT","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/tWHPRC\/upload_S3hy0Z-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/tWHPRC\/upload_S3hy0Z-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/tWHPRC\/upload_S3hy0Z-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/tWHPRC\/upload_S3hy0Z-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/tWHPRC\/upload_S3hy0Z-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:50","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:42:36","locations":[{"id":"1g0RBG","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"7734 Terrace Avenue","locality":"Middleton","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"53562","phone":"608-836-7100","website":"http:\/\/www.capital-brewery.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Tue:  4:00pm - 9:00pm\nWed:  4:00pm - 9:00pm\nThu:  4:00pm - 9:00pm\nFri:  4:00pm - 9:00pm\nSat:  12:00pm - 5:00pm\nSun:  12:00pm - 5:00pm\n\nMonday: CLOSED TO THE PUBLIC\r\nTuesday: 4:00pm-9:00pm\r\nWednesday: 4:00pm-9:00pm\r\nThursday: 4:00pm-9:00pm \r\nFriday: 4:00pm-9:00pm\r\nSaturday: 12:00pm-5:00pm\r\nSunday: 12:00pm-5:00pm","latitude":43.094848,"longitude":-89.5165838,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1984","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:50","updateDate":"2014-09-29 20:12:03","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"41Gl41","name":"Captain Jack Pilsner","nameDisplay":"Captain Jack Pilsner","description":"Captain James Jack Pilsner - A classic northern German \"Pils\", this straw-colored lager is crisp and smooth, with a subtle yet assertive hoppiness that doesn't overwhelm your palate or  the beer's malt backbone.

A starkly simple recipe combined with a painstakingly complex brewing process produce an Imperial Pilsner of subtle elegance and delicately balanced contrasts. First wort hopping, a very old technique in which hops normally added late in the boil are put in at the beginning, and allowed to steep for a much longer time, gives the beer an especially refined hop aroma and flavor. The 100% Pilsner malt makes a clear, yet restrained statement, answered by a stead, harmonious chorus of Saaz hop bitterness, echoes of which linger in the dry, crisp finish.","abv":"8","ibu":"29","glasswareId":4,"availableId":2,"styleId":75,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/K5DpLS\/upload_folfji-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/K5DpLS\/upload_folfji-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/K5DpLS\/upload_folfji-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:00","updateDate":"2015-12-16 07:45:26","glass":{"id":4,"name":"Pilsner","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"style":{"id":75,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"German-Style Pilsener","shortName":"German Pilsener","description":"A classic German Pilsener is very light straw or golden in color and well hopped.

To add more backbone to the malt character, we run a 3 hour boil (Maillard Reaction) to caramelize and accentuate the German Pilsner malt which has a round and slightly bready mouth feel compared to US 2-row barley commonly found in most ale. This is a West Coast-brewed traditional German-Style Pilsner to enjoy as time flies.","abv":"5.5","ibu":"32.7","glasswareId":4,"availableId":6,"styleId":75,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/UmZuR3\/upload_ZlGfRM-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/UmZuR3\/upload_ZlGfRM-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/UmZuR3\/upload_ZlGfRM-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","servingTemperature":"very_cold","servingTemperatureDisplay":"Very Cold - (0-4C\/32-39F)","createDate":"2015-06-09 18:34:49","updateDate":"2015-12-18 02:32:36","glass":{"id":4,"name":"Pilsner","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":6,"name":"Summer","description":"Available during the summer months."},"style":{"id":75,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"German-Style Pilsener","shortName":"German Pilsener","description":"A classic German Pilsener is very light straw or golden in color and well hopped.

In 2010 we planted our flag in Downtown Fresno, CA and decided to take our journey of becoming the San Joaquin Valley\u2019s local brewery a step further. Our beer and brands reflect the greatness of the region we brew in. We highlight the beauty of the Southern Sierras that run along the Eastern side of the San Joaquin Valley that include landmarks such as Yosemite National Park, Sierra National Forest, Sequoia National Park, Kings Canyon National Park, and Sequoia National Forest. We also integrate and feature local flavor, creativity, and culture in our products to give our valley residents a sense of pride in what they drink and support.\r\n\r\nOur award-winning Brewmaster, Kevin Cox, has been spent over 20 years in the brewing industry. He began his career as a cellar master\/production manager for Heitz Wine Cellars in the Napa Valley from 1979-1989. He then moved to Fresno to help in the founding of Butterfield Brewing Company, a San Joaquin Valley favorite for many years. Butterfields Brewing Company evolved into Sequoia Brewing Co in 2003 and during his tenure with both breweries he won five gold medals at the Great American Beer Festival in Denver, Colorado, as well as numerous regional and State awards. In 2010 Kevin became head brewmaster at Tioga-Sequoia Brewing Co. and helped to build our current downtown brewery.\r\n\r\nAll Tioga-Sequoia products are brewed in downtown Fresno, California. We recently renovated our grain warehouse to become a tasting room in a Beer Garden style fashion. Our hope is that the #TSBeerGarden will bring new life to our city\u2019s downtown with an outdoor venue that provides a unique variety of fresh, local craft beer with an urban atmosphere. We host numerous types of events monthly that include live music, art shows, and food trucks. The Beer Garden has regular hours for onsite consumption with bottles, kegs and growlers to go.","website":"http:\/\/www.tioga-sequoia.com","established":"2007","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/f3JwxU\/upload_Eujdf7-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/f3JwxU\/upload_Eujdf7-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/f3JwxU\/upload_Eujdf7-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/f3JwxU\/upload_Eujdf7-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/f3JwxU\/upload_Eujdf7-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-08-19 16:26:44","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:15:10","locations":[{"id":"wdjaPp","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"745 Fulton St.","locality":"Fresno","region":"California","phone":"(559) 486-2337","latitude":36.7314814,"longitude":-119.7881204,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-08-19 19:20:56","updateDate":"2015-08-19 19:20:56","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"zXot32","name":"Cuv\u00e9e Pilsener","nameDisplay":"Cuv\u00e9e Pilsener","abv":"5.5","glasswareId":4,"styleId":75,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-10 19:29:02","updateDate":"2016-01-27 18:02:25","glass":{"id":4,"name":"Pilsner","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"style":{"id":75,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"German-Style Pilsener","shortName":"German Pilsener","description":"A classic German Pilsener is very light straw or golden in color and well hopped.

In 1886 Adam Schumacher bought the brewery and started brewing beer. In 1906, the Potosi Brewing Company was founded by Adam and his brothers Nicholas and Henry. At its peak, the Potosi Brewery had grown to be the fifth largest in Wisconsin, shipping a variety of labels including Good Old Potosi, Holiday, Garten Brau, Augsburger and others to destinations throughout the United States. In 1972 the brewery ceased operations and closed its doors.\r\n\r\nThe restoration of the Potosi Brewery began in 1995 when Gary David bought the ruined Potosi Brewery Bottling buildings. This nearly one square block of buildings had just suffered a major fire and most of the buildings were a total loss. After working three years to rebuild parts of what had been destroyed, Gary then turned his attention to the Brewery itself. Being awarded the high bid at the county auction he then enlisted the help of his friend Rick Tobin and cousin Denis David. It was the marketing genius of Denis and his wife Madonna in 1999 that brought the public on board through a community meeting. This meeting was overwhelmingly attended by the public and brought forth numerous suggestions as well as additional support. It was this gathering of the public that led to the formation of the Potosi Brewery Foundation in February of 2000.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, with restoration underway, the Potosi Brewery Foundation was selected by the American Breweriana Association to be the home to its national museum. According to Len Chylack, president of the American Breweriana Association, Potosi was selected over cities such as Milwaukee and St. Louis because of their passion for beer, brewery history and beer-making culture.","website":"http:\/\/www.potosibrewery.com\/","established":"1852","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_ZDaYgp-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_ZDaYgp-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_ZDaYgp-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_ZDaYgp-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_ZDaYgp-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2016-06-24 17:44:52","locations":[{"id":"HeStKS","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"209 South Main Street","extendedAddress":"Box 177","locality":"Potosi","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"53820","phone":"608-763-4002","website":"http:\/\/www.potosibrewery.com\/","latitude":42.6716654,"longitude":-90.7271709,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1852","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"1fxro2","name":"Czechered Past Pilsner","nameDisplay":"Czechered Past Pilsner","abv":"5","availableId":4,"styleId":75,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-10 16:09:14","updateDate":"2014-09-11 19:39:59","available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":75,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"German-Style Pilsener","shortName":"German Pilsener","description":"A classic German Pilsener is very light straw or golden in color and well hopped. Perception of hop bitterness is medium to high. Noble-type hop aroma and flavor are moderate and quite obvious. It is a well-attenuated, medium-light bodied beer, but a malty residual sweetness can be perceived in aroma and flavor. Very low levels of sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) character are below most beer drinkers' taste thresholds and are usually not detectable except to the trained or sensitive palate. Other fermentation or hop related sulfur compounds, when perceived at low levels, may be characteristic of this style. Fruity esters and diacetyl should not be perceived. There should be no chill haze. Its head should be dense and rich.","ibuMin":"25","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"4","abvMax":"5","srmMin":"3","srmMax":"4","ogMin":"1.044","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.012","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:35:59"},"breweries":[{"id":"Ezd2gH","name":"Iron Springs Pub & Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Iron Springs Pub","description":"Brewpub in the heart of Marin County.","website":"http:\/\/ironspringspub.com","established":"2004","mailingListUrl":"info@ironspringspub.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Ezd2gH\/upload_O33nKw-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Ezd2gH\/upload_O33nKw-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Ezd2gH\/upload_O33nKw-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Ezd2gH\/upload_O33nKw-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Ezd2gH\/upload_O33nKw-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:48:54","locations":[{"id":"ZtC7fU","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"765 Center Boulevard","locality":"Fairfax","region":"California","postalCode":"94930","phone":"1-415-485-1005","latitude":37.9861207,"longitude":-122.5839897,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
