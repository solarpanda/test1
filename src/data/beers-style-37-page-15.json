They embarked on a research road trip to the \u201cbeer capitol,\u201d Denver, Colorado, for some inspiration. There, they developed the vision of Prairie Sun Brewery.\r\n\r\nAfter 19 months their vision became a reality as they took their passion and hard work, and brewed their first batch of beer on a 10-barrel system. Starting a business is no easy task\u2026starting a craft brewery is even tougher.

In May 2013, Heather and Cameron found the perfect home at the former \u201cSaskatoon Bakery\u201d and they moved in! By June 2015, Prairie Sun had grown to 12 employees and could be found in many restaurants around Saskatoon.

It didn't take long before the act, the ideas, and the processes of brewing began to take over our lives. Shortly thereafter we dubbed ourselves Black Pond Brews, after a pond where we had some fun and memorable times in Woodstock, CT. Within no time we were entering our beers into homebrew competitions and they were met with immediate success. Spurred by this success and by the constant clamoring of our friends and family to make more beer, we really began to ask ourselves: how do we turn this passion for producing beer into a commercial reality?\r\n \r\nOur project is not only valuable to us, but to the community in which we will operate.  Our beautiful, quiet town of Danielson, CT will become a destination for anyone who loves beer, be they local or travellers.  Who doesn't love beer?  Further, who doesn't love MORE beer to try?!\r\n \r\nWhat inspires us?\r\nThe ability to write or create something unique, something revolutionary. Clara Barton once said \u201cI defy the tyranny of precedent. I go for anything new that might improve the past\". Such a philosophy is inherent in the way we approach brewing. Breweries often spend much of their time and effort looking back to past recipes- often times as far back as the inception of brewing itself- but what of the future? What new ideas and flavors can we explore? We are always pushing the envelope against the grain- but our guiding star will always be uncompromising flavor of the highest quality.","website":"http:\/\/www.blackpondbrews.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/RBaOzm\/upload_V4dCw0-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/RBaOzm\/upload_V4dCw0-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/RBaOzm\/upload_V4dCw0-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/RBaOzm\/upload_V4dCw0-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/RBaOzm\/upload_V4dCw0-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-05-17 11:34:47","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:09:03","locations":[{"id":"t8ecnf","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"21A Furnace St","locality":"Danielson","region":"Connecticut","postalCode":"06239","phone":"860-207-5295","website":"BlackPondBrews.com","hoursOfOperation":"Thu:  5:00pm - 8:00pm\nFri:  5:00pm - 8:00pm\nSat:  3:00pm - 8:00pm\nSun:  12:00pm - 5:00pm\n\nWe are located in the basement of the beautiful Danielson Adventure Sports Building.","latitude":41.804121,"longitude":-71.883942,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"nano","locationTypeDisplay":"Nano Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-05-17 11:34:47","updateDate":"2015-05-18 14:49:59","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"IOfkLe","name":"Itty Bitty Brown","nameDisplay":"Itty Bitty Brown","abv":"5.5","styleId":37,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-02-08 18:53:38","updateDate":"2016-02-08 18:53:38","style":{"id":37,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Brown Ale","shortName":"American Brown","description":"American brown ales range from deep copper to brown in color.
