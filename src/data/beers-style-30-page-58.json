Whole ingredients are used with traditional brewing equipment which is controlled by state of the art systems that manage temperature throughout the brewing process. These same systems harvest waste BTU's, capturing the energy that would normally be lost and reusing it to preheat ingredients, maintain product temperatures, and even heat the taproom via an in-floor heating system. Waste materials such as process water and spent grain are also captured and stored for fertilization and irrigation of our crops.\r\n\r\nThe prep table in the brewery quite often looks like the prep area in a fine restaurant. Fresh herbs, fruits and vegetables are a common sight, along with an amazing array of spices, roots and even flowers. Whole foods, fresh frozen or dried are used, artificial flavorings, extracts and coloring agents are not. The beer is unfiltered, its clarity being attained by the addition of natural clarifying agents and allowing ample time for the beer to condition.\r\n\r\nBrewery Terra Firma began brewing operations in May of 2013, with the taproom opening to the public in July of the same year.","website":"http:\/\/www.breweryterrafirma.com\/","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-11-18 12:30:28","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:48:26","locations":[{"id":"1QFuku","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2959 Hartman Rd","locality":"Traverse City","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49685","phone":"(231) 929-1600","website":"http:\/\/www.breweryterrafirma.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  10:00am - 10:00pm\nSun:  2:00pm - 9:00pm\n\n10:00 AM to 10:00 PM Monday through Saturday, and from 2:00 PM to 9:00 PM on Sunday","latitude":44.7154521,"longitude":-85.6354376,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-11-18 12:32:00","updateDate":"2014-09-29 20:36:47","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"3qlJYF","name":"Lizzie's Famous 81 Whacks","nameDisplay":"Lizzie's Famous 81 Whacks","styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/3qlJYF\/upload_vKG5PU-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/3qlJYF\/upload_vKG5PU-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/3qlJYF\/upload_vKG5PU-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-11-15 14:50:27","updateDate":"2015-12-16 21:50:17","style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

Initially started in a barn on old farmland near Corcoran Vineyards, this combination became Virginia\u2019s first vineyard \/ brewery combo in the state. After several years of growing business it was realized that there was not enough room to stay as demand for the beer grew. In early 2014 the brewery was moved to Purcellville Virginia which is about 6 miles from where it started.\r\n\r\nCorcoran Brewing Company has produced over thirty three distinct beers since opening day. We strive to create both traditional beer types as well as creating unique experiences with experimental beers. On any given day we have twelve beers on tap ranging from Kolch style, American Pale Ales, IPA\u2019s, Imperial IPA\u2019s, Stouts, Bourbon barrel aged, port barrel aged and more. This daily broad selection of quality hand-made craft beers has been a primary reason for our success.

Originally, the Portsmouth Brewery opened with beer recipes from Northampton - Pale Ale, Old Brown Dog, Weizenheimer, Black Cat Stout, Blonde Ale, Golden and Amber Lagers - and these still comprise the core of the Brewery's full-time beers today. However, over the years, successive brewers have contributed many outstanding seasonal and specialty beers to the list.

We use generous amounts of dark malt for balance alongside the hop character, which create a complex texture and flavors with a satisfying finish.\r\n\r\nLong Black Veil was originally introduced in October 2014 to coincide with the anniversary of the death of its namesake. The name of the beer was inspired by Alexandria\u2019s famous mystery of the veiled Female Stranger. In 1816, a young woman who had fallen ill was brought ashore from a ship at Alexandria\u2019s port and her husband never removed the thick veil she wore to conceal her identity. They moved into Room 8 at Gadsby\u2019s Tavern and her husband swore the doctor and nurses to secrecy. After two months, she died in his arms on October 14, and he himself prepared and buried her body in a cemetery at the edge of Old Town. The identity of this veiled \u201cFemale Stranger\u201d remains a mystery to this day.\r\n\r\nThis is the first production-scale beer to be developed by Port City Brewers Josh Center and Adam Reza, under supervision of Head Brewer Jonathan Reeves.\u2028","abv":"6.75","ibu":"65","glasswareId":5,"styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","originalGravity":"1.066","createDate":"2014-11-10 16:22:21","updateDate":"2015-08-20 15:46:55","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

We've worked hard and are incredibly proud of the many successes we've enjoyed over the years. The Boston Beer Company has been cited as one of the best companies to work for by Boston Magazine, one of the Best Entry-Level Jobs by The Princeton Review, and our beers have won more awards than any other in history. Jim has been named an \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" by Inc. Magazine. Our brewers keep amazing us with innovative new brews, including Samuel Adams Utopias and our Samuel Adams Barrel Room Collection.\r\n\r\nJim has believed from the beginning that the more you know and understand about beer, the more you'll appreciate a beer like Samuel Adams Boston Lager. To begin that mission, all new employees go through intensive training on everything from ingredients, brewing, and beer styles, to taking care of the beer once it leaves the brewery. We're all beer lovers and protectors of the beer so we're trained how to identify off flavors and how to troubleshoot the causes. The passion for beer continues with an annual homebrew competition that we all take part in.\r\n\r\nOne of our wholesalers once asked Jim why he invested so much in training his people, when ultimately they might leave. Jim smiled and replied without hesitation: \"What if I didn't train them, and they stayed?\"\r\n\r\nEach year, usually in January, everyone gathers together. One of the highlights of the meeting is the beer trivia contest. With a culture so steeped in beer education and knowledge, winning is a pretty big deal. Recently, one of the hotel bartenders who was watching as the various teams arrived in costume with music and much enthusiasm and fanfare, said, \"I've always known Samuel Adams made the best beer in America, but now I see this is the greatest company in America.\" When you look around you see that The Boston Beer Company is a team of enthusiastic people who are passionate about beer and who really love coming to work every day to provide American drinkers with the best beer possible.\r\n\r\nThe Boston Beer Company, Inc. is a publicly-traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol, SAM.","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","established":"1984","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:24:45","locations":[{"id":"DF5YsC","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"30 Germania Street","locality":"Boston","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"02130","phone":"1-800-372-1131","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","latitude":42.314449,"longitude":-71.103365,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1984","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2015-12-02 19:22:03","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"MLUbXI","name":"Cincinnati","streetAddress":"1625 Central Parkway","locality":"Cincinnati","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45214","phone":"513-412-3200","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","latitude":39.1144986,"longitude":-84.5222061,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-12 13:10:57","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"XZ6L8a","name":"Production Brewery","streetAddress":"7880 Penn Drive","locality":"Breinigsville","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"18031","latitude":40.5759622,"longitude":-75.6290377,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2007","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-11-30 20:24:56","updateDate":"2015-12-02 19:22:03","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"fvsqwZ","name":"Look The Witch In The Eyes","nameDisplay":"Look The Witch In The Eyes","description":"Engulf yourself in oceans of crimson!

While the name of the company remains Clipper City Brewing Company, all of its beer falls under the Heavy Seas brand. Heavy Seas is located at 4615 Hollins Ferry Road, Suite B, in the Halethorpe section of Baltimore. Heavy Seas currently offers a variety of beer styles in approx. 18 states within the United States.\r\n\r\nHeavy Seas mission is to bring back the local brewery, and to do it in such a way that we are more than just a fringe player, but a positive part of our area.

An accomplished home brewer since 1995, Yager has designed numerous seasonal and specialty batches, from the Dark Hammer Belgian Quad to the UberAlt sticke ale. Other recurring ales are more experimental, blending styles, as with Tobacco Road, an imperial amber designed to complement a good cigar, or the occasional Lonesome Hop series, which spotlights the character of an individual hop. Yellowhammer is Yager's first commercial undertaking.\r\n\r\nYellowhammer Brewing opened on Oct. 16, 2010 with the best-selling Belgian white ale and the IPA. Other staples sold throughout the year include a German style altbier and the Miracle Worker, a potent Belgian tripel.","website":"http:\/\/www.yellowhammerbrewery.com\/","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BI8mE7\/upload_Kf31WU-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BI8mE7\/upload_Kf31WU-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BI8mE7\/upload_Kf31WU-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BI8mE7\/upload_Kf31WU-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BI8mE7\/upload_Kf31WU-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:13","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:23:20","locations":[{"id":"4V6C7Y","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2406 Clinton Avenue","locality":"West Huntsville","region":"Alabama","postalCode":"35805","phone":"256-975-5950","website":"http:\/\/www.yellowhammerbrewery.com\/","latitude":34.722525,"longitude":-86.603703,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2010","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:13","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
