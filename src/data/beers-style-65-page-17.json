It measures 4.4% ABV and is a wonderfully refreshing, easy drinking beer enjoyed throughout the year. Its grain bill includes nearly 50% unmalted wheat and oats while it is very lightly spiced with Coriander, Orange Peel, and a touch of other unique flavors. The yeast in this recipe was cultured from the original strain near the town of Hoegaarden in Belgium and adds a pleasant fruitiness during fermentation.

In its brief commercial life to date, it has garnered respect and admiration from the beer enthusiast community and won several awards.\r\n\r\nOwners of a nearby ostrich-raising farm in Lo-Reninge with accommodations for vacationers, Urbain Coutteau and Philippe Driessens developed an interest in making distinctive regional beers to serve to their guests. In 2001 they began doing so with help from local wine maker Carlo Grootaert, and this project eventually developed into its own independent commercial concern.\r\n\r\nUpon its inception in 2003, Struise produced beers at the Caulier brewery in northern Hainaut. Since 2006, they have been made at the Deca brewing facility in Woesten-Vleteren in West Flanders. The firm has reported that their own microbrewery and tasting room in a renovated school building in Oostvleteren, is currently open & operational.\r\n\r\nThe company takes its name from the historic Flemish word for ostrich, which also is a contemporary slang term meaning \"tough\". They render the name into English as \"The Sturdy Brewers\", and many of their labels feature ostriches, a trait they share with Dutch microbrewery Brouwerij 't IJ.\r\n\r\nFollowing current industry trends made popular by American craft brewers, DSB has recently ventured into stronger, more flavorful beers and also barrel-aging. While often drawing upon various traditional styles, they have won acclaim by creating unique products which reflect their own personal vision.\r\n\r\nThey have also collaborated with other recent arrivals on the European artisan beer scene such as Denmark's Mikkeller, fellow Belgians Picobrouwerij Alvinne and Brouwerij De Molen of the Netherlands, as well as American brewers.","website":"http:\/\/struise.com\/","established":"2001","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/bjwFtZ\/upload_lRcQQa-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/bjwFtZ\/upload_lRcQQa-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/bjwFtZ\/upload_lRcQQa-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/bjwFtZ\/upload_lRcQQa-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/bjwFtZ\/upload_lRcQQa-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:44:16","locations":[{"id":"qcAp7N","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Woesten","locality":"Woesten","region":"West-Vlaanderen","website":"http:\/\/www.struisebrouwers.be\/","latitude":50.900311,"longitude":2.7831,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"BE","yearOpened":"2001","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"BE","name":"BELGIUM","displayName":"Belgium","isoThree":"BEL","numberCode":56,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"zKipbt","name":"Witte Ale","nameDisplay":"Witte Ale","description":"Ommegang Witte is unmalted wheat, orange peel, and coriander - offering a refreshing style that showcases the Belgian talent for brewing full-flavored ales that are also light, balanced, and simply intriguing.

Starting in 1910, the building housed the Hyattsville Hardware Co. which stayed in continuous operation until 1992. In its heyday, the hardware Co. was the center of community activity, selling everything from pots and pans to remedies for livestock maladies, chicken feed and of course, nuts and bolts.

Unlike others that brew \u201cPale Ale Style\u201d  Our beer is brewed on an Authentic British Pale Ale Brew House using the finest English Pale Ale Malt, American Hops and Yeast.  I have been brewing American Pale Ales since 1982, back in the days when I brewed 20 Liters at a time as a homebrewer.  Today I brew 2000 Liters at a time (more friends then back then).  I grew up in Northern California during the Microbrewery Revolution and you will taste that in my beers. Of course I never pasteurize our beers or add anything artificial.  Trust me when I say, Beer coming from Pf\u00e4ffikon to your dinner table will taste fresher than beer brought in a container traveling 2 months over the ocean.  Don\u2019t just take our word for it, Biergenuss Magazine calls us \u201cThe Rothschild of Beer\u201d. Thanks to all of you for making Western Rider the number one selling Pale Ale in Switzerland. Unlike many other brands, we are not brewed in Germany or in another Kanton and then sold as a \u201cLocal\u201d or \u201cSwiss Beer\u201d. We are also not a big beer factory, owned by a European neighbor.  With every Sudwerk Beer, you are enjoying an Authentic Pale Ale produced here in Switzerland, by a family owned and operated \u201cKleinbrauerei\u201d\/Microbrewery. With every Sudwerk Beer, you enjoy the true meaning of Swiss Quality and the results of good old fashioned hard work.

The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery. Goose Island beers are now enjoyed in all 50 states and Europe.","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:46:51","locations":[{"id":"S2n5TB","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1800 West Fulton Street","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60612","phone":"1-800-466-7363","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","latitude":41.887107,"longitude":-87.6720969,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:33:51","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"D2gG2C","name":"Clybourn","streetAddress":"1800 North Clybourn Avenue","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60614","phone":"800-466-7363","latitude":41.9137242,"longitude":-87.65373,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1988","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:32:55","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"ZmyBYs","name":"Wyoming Witbier","nameDisplay":"Wyoming Witbier","description":"Our Wyoming Witbier is a wheat based beer with a light cloudy color and medium body.

All we have to say is that there is a whole lot of creativity in those vats of beer just dying to come out, and we never stop till we get it right.","website":"http:\/\/www.duclaw.com\/","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TVgBWg\/upload_Dz9pkZ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TVgBWg\/upload_Dz9pkZ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TVgBWg\/upload_Dz9pkZ-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TVgBWg\/upload_Dz9pkZ-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TVgBWg\/upload_Dz9pkZ-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:14","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:44:54","locations":[{"id":"V8LP7a","name":"Bel Air","streetAddress":"16 A Bel Air South Parkway","locality":"Bel Air","region":"Maryland","postalCode":"21015","phone":"410-515-3222","website":"http:\/\/www.duclaw.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sun & Mon: \r\nDining Room: 11:00am -

Coriander and light orange peel aroma should be perceived as such or as an unidentified spiciness. Phenolic spiciness and yeast flavors may be evident at mild levels. These beers are traditionally bottle conditioned and served cloudy. An unfiltered starch and yeast haze should be part of the appearance. The low to medium body should have some degree of creaminess from wheat starch. The style is further characterized by the use of noble-type hops to achieve low hop bitterness and little to no apparent hop flavor. This beer has no diacetyl and a low to medium fruity-ester level. Mild acidity is appropriate.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"17","abvMin":"4.8","abvMax":"5.2","srmMin":"2","srmMax":"4","ogMin":"1.044","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.01","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:32:30"},"breweries":[{"id":"yfDPgj","name":"Indiana City Brewing Co.","nameShortDisplay":"Indiana City","description":"It\u2019s our mission to brew innovative beers for craft beer lovers in Indy.
