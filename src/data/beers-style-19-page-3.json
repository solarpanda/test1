He spent years perfecting his recipes and letting the community decide what beers they wanted from their local brewery. He fearlessly concocted hundreds of different beers to see what new flavors he might come up with. Not all were a hit, but that is how you find a gem. Do you have an idea for a beer you\u2019d like to try? Let him know, he just might try it out.\r\n \r\n903 Brewers officially opened its doors in June of 2013 and introduced to the world The Chosen One Coconut Ale and Roo\u2019s Red Ale. Since that time they have released many new and exciting beers. Starting fall of 2014 you will be able to find their beers in 22oz bombers.","website":"http:\/\/903brewers.com\/","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/y2ZQbD\/upload_8jDik1-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/y2ZQbD\/upload_8jDik1-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/y2ZQbD\/upload_8jDik1-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/y2ZQbD\/upload_8jDik1-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/y2ZQbD\/upload_8jDik1-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-05 17:48:26","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:46:13","locations":[{"id":"q7dLm5","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1718 S Elm St","locality":"Sherman","region":"Texas","postalCode":"75090","phone":"214.243.8090","latitude":33.6171881,"longitude":-96.607032,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-05 20:13:38","updateDate":"2015-12-03 19:03:30","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"3E62m7","name":"Cucurbita Nigra","nameDisplay":"Cucurbita Nigra","description":"Maple-Pumpkin Porter","abv":"6.3","styleId":19,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-10-23 04:10:50","updateDate":"2014-10-27 19:00:37","style":{"id":19,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Robust Porter","shortName":"Robust Porter","description":"Robust porters are black in color and have a roast malt flavor, often reminiscent of cocoa, but no roast barley flavor.

Those of you who saw the old brewery may remember the retrofitted dairy equipment we used. We held on to two of those tanks in our move to the East Asheville location. Alongside them, we have new fermentation and brite beer tanks to go with our 50-barrel brew house. Our pilot brew house is a brewer's playground for developing new seasonal beers, high gravity brews, and whatever else the brewers dream up.

The ingredients made it possible to produce this beer for less cost than a stout, so these beers were named for \"the help\" (the porters). Stouts were generally made for the wealthier people. Traditionally, a stout uses grains which give it a more roasty flavor, whereas a porter usues malts which impart sweeter chocolate or caramel notes. Stouts are known for a fuller body, whereas the porter generally has a lighter mouth feel.","abv":"5.7","ibu":"37","glasswareId":5,"availableId":1,"styleId":19,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/po3p0f\/upload_f4k6QV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/po3p0f\/upload_f4k6QV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/po3p0f\/upload_f4k6QV-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"Ice Cream, Cheesecake, Chocolate Brownies, Pecan Glaze","originalGravity":"1.058","createDate":"2012-07-15 22:40:23","updateDate":"2015-12-16 17:34:18","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":19,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Robust Porter","shortName":"Robust Porter","description":"Robust porters are black in color and have a roast malt flavor, often reminiscent of cocoa, but no roast barley flavor.

These porters have a sharp bitterness of black malt without a highly burnt\/charcoal flavor. Caramel and other malt sweetness should be present and in harmony with other distinguishing porter characters. Robust porters range from medium to full in body and have a malty sweetness. Hop bitterness is medium to high, with hop aroma and flavor ranging from negligible to medium. Diacetyl is acceptable at very low levels. Fruity esters should be evident, balanced with roast malt and hop bitterness.","ibuMin":"25","ibuMax":"40","abvMin":"5","abvMax":"6.5","srmMin":"30","srmMax":"30","ogMin":"1.045","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:21:45"},"breweries":[{"id":"Ez9FvZ","name":"Modern Monks Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Modern Monks","description":"Modern Monks come from many different places.
