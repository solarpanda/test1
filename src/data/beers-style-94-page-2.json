The annual production of beer is aprox. 10 mill liter (85 000 barrels), and together with the production of 18 mill liters of soft drinks and mineralwater it gives employment to approximately 150 people.  You may wonder how we got our name ? It was a young fellow with the name Poul Lauritz Aass that bought the brewery in 1860. Since then it has been in the same family, and is today run by the 4th generation of Aass. (By the way - A real Norwegian viking would pronounce it Ouse)  The brewery is proud of its history. To us the quality of what we produce has always been and always will be the main issue. In 1516, Duke Wilhelm of Bavaria established a law admitting only malted barley, hops yeast, and water as ingredients in the production of beer. The law is known as the purity law and Aass Brewery is still loyal to Duke Wilhelm of Bavaria. In Norway the brewery is known for outstanding quality and large number of different beer types.","website":"http:\/\/www.aass.no","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TGtEbk\/upload_rooKoF-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TGtEbk\/upload_rooKoF-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TGtEbk\/upload_rooKoF-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TGtEbk\/upload_rooKoF-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TGtEbk\/upload_rooKoF-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:43","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:38:13","locations":[{"id":"gaVq6l","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Ole Steensgt. 10 Postboks 1530","locality":"Drammen","phone":"47-32-26-60-00","website":"http:\/\/www.aass.no","latitude":59.7440738,"longitude":10.2044564,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"NO","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:43","updateDate":"2015-11-20 18:30:48","country":{"isoCode":"NO","name":"NORWAY","displayName":"Norway","isoThree":"NOR","numberCode":578,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"G1WqpH","name":"FireFest","nameDisplay":"FireFest","styleId":94,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/G1WqpH\/upload_Hk3P4D-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/G1WqpH\/upload_Hk3P4D-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/G1WqpH\/upload_Hk3P4D-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-22 11:25:46","updateDate":"2015-12-17 05:18:00","style":{"id":94,"categoryId":8,"category":{"id":8,"name":"North American Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"American-Style Light (Low Calorie) Lager","shortName":"American Light Lager","description":"These beers are extremely light colored, light in body, and high in carbonation.

The saloon enjoyed a brisk business from the turn of the century until the advent of prohibition in 1920. The building, rich in history, is on the national registry of historic landmarks and has been restored to much of its original grandeur. Among the original architectural elements that remain today are the beautiful bar, intricate mosaic tile floor, much of the stained glass and of course the decorative ceiling. The luxurious back-bar won the coveted blue ribbon for craftsmanship at the 1893 World Columbian Exposition in Chicago.

We currently distribute our beer throughout Arkansas and Mississippi. Our styles of beer are produced in the old time honored traditional methods of European brewers, using only two-row malted barley, hops, yeast and great Arkansas water. Being brewed locally gives the beer a great advantage in \"freshness\" while still capturing some of the worlds most famous styles of beer without the use of adjuncts or preservatives!\r\n\r\nYou may be wondering where our name came from. Diamond Bear is brewed in Arkansas which is the only state to have a diamond mine. This is where the first part of our name came from. As for the bear portion of Diamond Bear, Arkansas was once home to a large population of bears. In fact, during the pioneer days Arkansas was known as the \"Bear State.\" Therefore, we combined the two to create a name that is distinctly Arkansan, Diamond Bear!","website":"http:\/\/www.diamondbear.com\/","established":"2000","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Xa3ue0\/upload_J3L4hF-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Xa3ue0\/upload_J3L4hF-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Xa3ue0\/upload_J3L4hF-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Xa3ue0\/upload_J3L4hF-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Xa3ue0\/upload_J3L4hF-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:27:29","locations":[{"id":"cnIhzJ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"600 N Broadway","locality":"North Little Rock","region":"Arkansas","postalCode":"72114","phone":"501-708-2739","website":"http:\/\/www.diamondbear.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Tuesday - Thursday 11am-9pm\r\nFriday - Saturday 11am-10pm\r\nSunday - 11am-9pm\r\nMonday - CLOSED","latitude":34.759269,"longitude":-92.272261,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2000","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"YU4AtD","name":"Honeygo Lite","nameDisplay":"Honeygo Lite","description":"Although this is a truly lite beer, it's not light on flavor.

All too often, they were less like bier than bier-flavored water. And isn\u2019t it surprising how so little flavor can leave such a bad taste in your mouth?\r\n\r\nAt Leavenworth Biers, we felt your pain. So, in the sunny summer of 2003, we created Leavenworth Light, the Northwest\u2019s first craft-brewed light bier.\r\n\r\nA thirst quencher of Alpine proportions, Leavenworth Light is generously flavorful with precious few calories. Its secret? To ample portions of Pilsen and Ashburne Mild malts we add just a touch of Munich malt. These three provide a distinct malt foundation that\u2019s long on flavor, yet remarkably short of calories and carbohydrates. We then hop with US Goldings. What results is well balanced, superbly flavorful bier. But calories? Fat chance: Leavenworth Light has just 75. On trail or off, its crisply malty flavor places Leavenworth Light among the best outdoor refreshments.

The plant became the Western Canada Brewing Company in 1930 and then Drewery\u2019s Limited in 1932. \r\n\r\nThe capacity of the Brewery at that time was 72 bottles per minute. Compare that to today\u2019s 360 bottles and 480 cans per minute. \r\n\r\nThe Brewery was acquired in 1956 and operated as O\u2019Keefe Brewing until 1989. When Carling O\u2019Keefe amalgamated with Molson Brewing Company, the intended closure created an opportunity for the employees. \r\n\r\nThe employees pooled their resources and in 1989 formed the Great Western Brewing Company. Now with a management-led employee group, the Great Western Brewing Company is one of Canada\u2019s most successful regional brewers and an internationally recognized producer of world-class beer.","website":"http:\/\/www.gwbc.ca","established":"1927","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Fq6PBJ\/upload_29NKJ6-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Fq6PBJ\/upload_29NKJ6-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Fq6PBJ\/upload_29NKJ6-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Fq6PBJ\/upload_29NKJ6-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Fq6PBJ\/upload_29NKJ6-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-11-20 05:50:40","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:01:38","locations":[{"id":"ppVBGn","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"519 Second Avenue","locality":"North Saskatoon","region":"Saskatchewan","postalCode":"S7K 2C6","phone":"(306) 653-4653","website":"http:\/\/www.gwbc.ca\/","latitude":52.13603,"longitude":-106.6605898,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"CA","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-11-20 13:33:31","updateDate":"2014-11-20 13:33:31","country":{"isoCode":"CA","name":"CANADA","displayName":"Canada","isoThree":"CAN","numberCode":124,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"3RxzYr","name":"Light","nameDisplay":"Light","description":"This very light, refreshing fruity Ale has a golden color and rich malty complexity that only old-world brewing can produce.
