Our brew master is the \u201cBig German\u201d Uwe Boer that we all know and love. He works magic in his craft and the passion that he shows for brewing fills the glasses as his award winning beer dispenses from our taps. We now boast our own regular taps but his innovation in our seasonal ales and distinct brewing style is what keeps our bar stools full and the place hopping. We can hardly keep his cask conditioned ale on tap as our customers are known to consume the kegs in record time.\r\n\r\n\u201cGreat Beer, Great Food and Great Service\u201d became our motto as we plugged through the first few years and now the slogan is what we live by. Our fantastic customers and great staff are what makes us who we are and how we stand out in the sea of new restaurants that pop up daily. It is our great customers that made it so easy to push forward into brewing and our loyal staff that helped to smooth over the transition. We continue to grow and change over time just as any business wants to do but it is remembering the little things that have gotten us to where we are today. After all in today\u2019s crazy hectic world it is the little things in life that make it all worth it.","website":"http:\/\/sunup.beer\/","established":"2001","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/F3gIYO\/upload_qemRGp-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/F3gIYO\/upload_qemRGp-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/F3gIYO\/upload_qemRGp-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/F3gIYO\/upload_qemRGp-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/F3gIYO\/upload_qemRGp-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2016-06-27 18:25:37","locations":[{"id":"nnn6Sq","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"322 East Camelback Road","locality":"Phoenix","region":"Arizona","postalCode":"85012","phone":"(602) 279-8909","website":"http:\/\/www.sunupbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sunday - Thursday 11:00am - 11:00pm\r\nFriday and Saturday to Midnight\r\nHappy Hour: 3:00 - 6:00 PM Daily","latitude":33.509286,"longitude":-112.068897,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Ck315a","name":"Barley Wine","nameDisplay":"Barley Wine","description":"Our Brewers and Artisans are busy in the lab putting the final touches on this beer.","availableId":3,"styleId":34,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-09 18:33:47","updateDate":"2013-08-14 18:44:24","available":{"id":3,"name":"Not Available","description":"Beer is not available."},"style":{"id":34,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Barley Wine Ale","shortName":"American Barleywine","description":"American style barley wines range from amber to deep copper-garnet in color and have a full body and high residual malty sweetness.

By the early 1980s, the last one had shuttered its doors. So when brothers Patrick and Daniel Conway opened Great Lakes Brewing Company on September 6, 1988, it not only signaled a new era in Cleveland brewing, it was also the first microbrewery in the state of Ohio.

When he wasn\u2019t busy handcrafting smoked summer sausage and pepperoni at the deli he was handcrafting small batches of beer.  Dick built from scratch a three barrel brew house (which we still use today as our pilot system) to start designing and creating recipes in the back of the deli. The beer was so popular among Dick\u2019s friends that he soon found himself exceeding the annual production limit for homebrewers.  In 1992 Dick decided to make his hobby a business and started the application and permit process to create Dick\u2019s Brewing Company.  After two years and many batches brewed, and many beers drank, Dick\u2019s Brewing Company became a reality.\r\n\r\nDick quickly realized he would need more space for his growing passion and built a 2,100 square foot building adjacent to the deli.  He started with the three barrel system and would brew once a week yielding 6 kegs.  Initially he focused solely on three beers: Pale, Porter and Dick Danger.  Dick Danger Ale, is still our best selling beer to date.  When asked why he started the brewery Dick always answered, and I quote, \u201cI started brewing beer for one reason, I was thirsty\u201d.   And we are all so grateful he was.\r\n\r\nThe brewery was located behind the Deli on Prather Road from 1995 to 2008.  Over those 13 years the brewery grew from 200 bbls in sales in one state to over 3000 bbls in 6 states.   New uni tanks and bright tanks were added along with a brand new bottling line to keep up with demand, and Dicks creative passion for brewing also grew, starting with three recipes in 1994 to over twenty different styles in 2009.  Life was good and  Dick\u2019s Beers were flying out the door.\r\nIn 2006 Dick set his sights even higher, and he started construction on a new brewing facility. After two long years of work  we moved into the brand new 18000 square foot brewing facility on Galvin Road in Centralia.\r\n\r\nDick wore many hats and he was so many things to so many people.  In 2009 we lost a brewmaster, a friend, a dad, a partner, a son, a teacher, a rebel, an electrician, a plumber, a carpenter, a craftsman, a joker, a complete and unique leader.  He will always be remembered and by doing so his vision and his dream will forever live on in every bottle or keg that gets shipped from the warehouse to someone that is thirsty.\r\n\r\nToday, the Dick\u2019s Brew Crew is led by Dick\u2019s daughter, Julie Young.  With the new brewing facility producing 23 different styles and with plenty of room for growth, we feel that the sky is the limit when it comes to Dick\u2019s legacy.  All of us here at Dick\u2019s are proud to continue the dream that our founder started, and we are proud to have you all along for the ride.","website":"http:\/\/dicksbeer.com\/","established":"1984","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/GC3a1f\/upload_tiILgV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/GC3a1f\/upload_tiILgV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/GC3a1f\/upload_tiILgV-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/GC3a1f\/upload_tiILgV-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/GC3a1f\/upload_tiILgV-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:44:31","locations":[{"id":"TkT8Rc","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"5945 Prather Road","locality":"Centralia","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98531","phone":"800-586-7760","website":"http:\/\/dicksbeer.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Fridays 3pm - 7pm","latitude":46.771347,"longitude":-123.007543,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1984","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"fWeJZh","name":"Barley Wine Ale","nameDisplay":"Barley Wine Ale","description":"The first sip of this brilliant, red-brown beer reveals a robust mouth feel and complex flavors including raisin, dark bread, some sherry flavors sure to increase with age.

All Legend beers are unpasteurized and made from only two-row and specialty barley malt, hops, water and yeast.","website":"http:\/\/www.legendbrewing.com\/","established":"1994","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BhfQBs\/upload_rpa3HE-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BhfQBs\/upload_rpa3HE-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BhfQBs\/upload_rpa3HE-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BhfQBs\/upload_rpa3HE-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BhfQBs\/upload_rpa3HE-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:00","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:06:43","locations":[{"id":"ujtlp3","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"321 West 7th Street","locality":"Richmond","region":"Virginia","postalCode":"23224","phone":"804-232-3446","website":"http:\/\/www.legendbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Thu:\t11:30 am - 11:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat:\t11:30 am - 12:00 am\r\nSun:\t12:30 pm - 10:00 pm","latitude":37.526596,"longitude":-77.442841,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1994","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:00","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"j4bzi7","name":"Barleywine","nameDisplay":"Barleywine","styleId":34,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:45","updateDate":"2015-05-14 15:57:13","style":{"id":34,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Barley Wine Ale","shortName":"American Barleywine","description":"American style barley wines range from amber to deep copper-garnet in color and have a full body and high residual malty sweetness.
