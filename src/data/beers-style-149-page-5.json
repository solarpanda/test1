The brewery addition was added back in 1994 but operated quietly as Oregon\u2019s smallest micobrewery for many years. With the more recent additions of David Vohden and Cameron Moore, we have refocused our efforts on producing and sharing a constantly changing lineup of fresh quality beers from right here in the Great Pacific Northwest. Vohden oversees all brewery operations which he has met with great success. Most recently of which was a Silver Medal for our Woozy Weizenbock at the Great American Beer Festival. We see our recent efforts bringing exciting results.\r\n\r\nWe reached completion of a 3,500 sq ft. addition to expand our brew house in the Summer of 2013. Vohden and Moore finished installation of the glycol system just in time to quench the thirsty demands of the 2013 Oregon Brewers Festival with a crowd pleasing Traverse Cherry Wit Bier. In addition to the brew house expansion we have added four 7-barrel fermentation tanks for an eventual all around 7-barrel system upgrade. A Cellar was also added for barrel aging, sours, and other delectable experiments.\r\n\r\nAlthough most of the square footage was utilized for brewing purposes. We were sure to save some space for all you beer drinkers. A mezzanine gives an elevated view down onto the open brewery floor. If you happen to drop by on a brew day you too can enjoy the sweet sensory overload and watch the action (or lack thereof). A beautiful black walnut bar, fully stocked with 13 drafts faucets was added to accompany the additional seating area and to cater to private events. However, the new bar and brewery seating are always open to patrons except in the case of private events. Another 60\u2032 TV was added to the new mezzanine area and we continue to play all major sporting events. Go Blazers!\r\n\r\nSome would say our legendary steak sandwiches and two dozen rotating taps are a match made in heaven.

Carefully crafted from the best apples grown on our family farm and nearby orchards, our ciders are made with 100% pure apple juice.\r\n\r\nLocated on the picturesque island of Prince Edward County in Southeastern Ontario, our tasting room and retail store welcomes visitors from May to November. Come visit us or look for County Cider Co. products at restaurants, bars and LCBO stores\r\n\r\nThe County Cider Company is located on Ontario\u2019s island of Prince Edward County. Most famous for the giant sand dunes and golden beaches of Sandbanks Provincial Park, the County also enjoys a dramatic history.\r\n\r\nFollowing the American Revolution of 1776 the Township of Marysburgh\u2014home to the County Cider Co.\u2014was one of many established for the settlement of United Empire Loyalists. Named in honour of Princess Mary, a daughter of King George III, it became home to a small group of disbanded German mercenaries under former Lieutenant Baron von Reitzenstein. This party, numbering about 40 persons, was one of the earliest German-speaking groups to settle in Ontario. By October 1784 they had begun to clear and cultivate the land. Henry David and his wife Elizabeth were among these early settlers and it was in 1830, that their son Conrad David, was given title to the lot, which the County Cider Co. now calls home.\r\n\r\nconradhouseToday, the 1832 Conrad David House is an area landmark. Set on the brow of the Waupoos escarpment, the stone house is an excellent example of Regency Cottage architecture. It features dramatic French doors, over-sized windows and veranda as well as a hipped roof. Next door, the property\u2019s picturesque 1832 stone barn houses the County Cider Co.\u2019s tasting room and retail store. Visitors are invited to take advantage of the million-dollar view of Lake Ontario from our patio and enjoy a cold, refreshing cider and a light lunch.","website":"https:\/\/www.countycider.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/X2f0T4\/upload_dor90I-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/X2f0T4\/upload_dor90I-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/X2f0T4\/upload_dor90I-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/X2f0T4\/upload_dor90I-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/X2f0T4\/upload_dor90I-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-17 15:27:24","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:05:03","locations":[{"id":"lUB6ge","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"657 Bongards Crossroad","locality":"Picton","region":"Ontario","postalCode":"K0K 2T0","phone":"613-476-1022","latitude":44.008942,"longitude":-77.1375219,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"cidery","locationTypeDisplay":"Cidery","countryIsoCode":"CA","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-17 20:35:34","updateDate":"2015-02-17 20:35:50","country":{"isoCode":"CA","name":"CANADA","displayName":"Canada","isoThree":"CAN","numberCode":124,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"rKjM20","name":"Weim-R-iner","nameDisplay":"Weim-R-iner","description":"This is for all the beer drinkers.
