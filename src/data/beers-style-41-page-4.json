The contradiction is in the name of the style - Black IPA or \"Black India Pale Ale\". The history of this style is not very long - it started just a few years ago. It all started in US and doesn't have any connection to India despite the name. The authors of the style tried to brew a beer which was very similar to IPA in terms of aroma and taste but had a deep black color. The problem which the brewer encountered was that dark malts used to brew dark beer tend to add a coffee-chocolate-burnt flavors and aromas - the characteristics usually not associated with real IPA. Our beer has a distinctive aroma of citruses, tropical fruits, lemon, mango and a bit of pines, having a dry bitter taste full of hops. And a very very light touch of chocolate. But if you drink it with you eyes closed it would be very challenging to discover what is the color of the beer - black beer is usually associated with porters and stouts. The name sends us to those years when Caribbeans were full of pirates, most of them were from England.","abv":"6","ibu":"50","styleId":41,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/GxxKWe\/upload_VKmgdt-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/GxxKWe\/upload_VKmgdt-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/GxxKWe\/upload_VKmgdt-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","originalGravity":"1.06","createDate":"2015-01-28 19:19:36","updateDate":"2015-12-17 21:52:28","style":{"id":41,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Black Ale","shortName":"Black Ale","description":"American-style Black Ales are very dark to black and perceived to have medium high to high hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content, balanced with a medium body.

We began as a herb farm, growing culinary and medicinal herbs for the garden center trade. \r\n \r\nOur herb farm, Sunflower Cottage, grows 120,000 potted herb plants each spring from seeds and cuttings to sell to other garden centers and to our own customers. \r\n \r\nIn the fall of 2012, we built our hops field.  After all, hops are the herbs that flavor beer.  Hops provide the bitter balance to the sweet malt that feeds yeast, which ferments beer.\r\n \r\nIn 2013 we began the process of creating an ordinance in Warren County to accomodate farm breweries.  By late spring, the process was complete and Backroom Brewery became the first farm brewery in the Northern Shenandoah Valley.\r\n \r\nOur first hop harvest in August of 2013 was bountiful.  We were brewing in small batches and planning our brewery construction.  In the spring of 2014 we began construction and finished our brewery building plus equipment installation by July of 2014. \r\n \r\nLife is good and we are living the dream. \r\n \r\nWe now have nearly 20 beer recipes approved by the State of VA. \r\n \r\nOur tasting room bustles and our scratch kitchen cranks out delicious dishes prepared with our own fresh herbs and farm grown produce in season.\r\n \r\nIn the spring , summer and fall, gardens abound, families enjoy the farm, the scenery, the corn hole, the labyrinth and chalk boards. Pets are welcome.\r\n \r\nWe host 3 annual events, The Virginia Herb Festival (June), BRB Hop Harvest Party (August) and BRB Holiday Market (November). \r\n \r\nYou are cordially invited to come and drink our beer, eat, play and spend some time.","website":"http:\/\/www.backroombreweryva.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BQFHyL\/upload_QcGVGX-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BQFHyL\/upload_QcGVGX-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BQFHyL\/upload_QcGVGX-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BQFHyL\/upload_QcGVGX-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BQFHyL\/upload_QcGVGX-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-04-18 17:05:13","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:07:46","locations":[{"id":"CEon99","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"150 Ridgemont Rd.","locality":"Middletown","region":"Virginia","postalCode":"22645","phone":"540-869-8482","latitude":38.9956004,"longitude":-78.2210269,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"nano","locationTypeDisplay":"Nano Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-04-18 17:05:13","updateDate":"2015-11-19 22:21:12","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"krzcfE","name":"Black Watch IPA","nameDisplay":"Black Watch IPA","abv":"6.8","styleId":41,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-12-13 03:41:17","updateDate":"2012-12-13 03:41:22","style":{"id":41,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Black Ale","shortName":"Black Ale","description":"American-style Black Ales are very dark to black and perceived to have medium high to high hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content, balanced with a medium body.

This milestone not only exemplifies their continuing commitment to amazing craft beer, but also signals a shift in focus for the brewery towards more innovative recipes and concepts.\r\n\r\nHeaded up by a small group of impassioned beer lovers including head brewer Garett Lockhart, Red Brick is determined to lead the charge in the south, putting out excellent beers such as \"Hoplanta\" IPA and the upcoming winter release \"Sacred Cow\" chai milk stout. They also take time to push the limits of brewing with the \"Brick Mason\" series, which the staff sees as their continuing masterpiece. Highlights from this series include \"The Lost Years\" old ale, \"Black-Eye Rye\" American black ale, and the most recent release \"20th Anniversary\", a 10% Imperial stout that was aged in Buffalo Trace bourbon barrels. Early accolades have already compared it to the hallowed KBS.\r\n\r\nThe future keeps looking brighter and brighter for this brewery, and the next couple years will see them growing and experimenting with diverse styles, collaborating with fellow breweries, implementing a new barrel program, and continuing to raise the bar for themselves in all aspects. After all, craft beer isn't just a product; it's a journey.","website":"http:\/\/www.redbrickbrewing.com\/","established":"1993","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/11gqIZ\/upload_kE3Udx-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/11gqIZ\/upload_kE3Udx-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/11gqIZ\/upload_kE3Udx-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/11gqIZ\/upload_kE3Udx-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/11gqIZ\/upload_kE3Udx-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:05:16","locations":[{"id":"QC2xF6","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2323 Defoor Hills Road","locality":"Atlanta","region":"Georgia","postalCode":"30318","phone":"404-355-5558","website":"http:\/\/www.redbrickbrewing.com\/","latitude":33.818002,"longitude":-84.435253,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1993","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"AkT38u","name":"Black-Eyed PA","nameDisplay":"Black-Eyed PA","abv":"5.6","styleId":41,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-03 16:37:13","updateDate":"2015-04-29 19:29:20","style":{"id":41,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Black Ale","shortName":"Black Ale","description":"American-style Black Ales are very dark to black and perceived to have medium high to high hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content, balanced with a medium body.

Beer was the mission, and liberation was the movement.  With a lot of elbow grease, blind ambition and a little luck, the quest to create a community pub in Northwest Lower Michigan began to take shape.  The philosophy was to bring an appreciation of craft beer to the north with product education and creativity.  The process of appreciation through education we call beer liberation.\r\n\r\nToday Short\u2019s Brewing Company continues the effort to educate and liberate consumers.  We take pride in our hands on, mom and pop approach and the energy we put into the quality of our beer, food, staff, customers and facilities. We believe in the power of the smallness.   We intend on remaining a smaller, state wide beer distributor and focusing our energies close to home (the SBC Michigan stimulus package).  Our goal is to get to a comfortable production volume, enjoy what we do and love life in Northern Michigan.","website":"http:\/\/www.shortsbrewing.com\/","established":"2004","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2016-02-04 14:44:21","locations":[{"id":"CzopCY","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"121 North Bridge Street","locality":"Bellaire","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49615","phone":"231-533-6622","website":"http:\/\/www.shortsbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sun - Thu: 11:00 am \u2013 11:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:00 am - 12:00 am","latitude":44.976269,"longitude":-85.210357,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2004","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"l6X2MV","name":"Blue Eyed Black","nameDisplay":"Blue Eyed Black","abv":"6","glasswareId":5,"styleId":41,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/l6X2MV\/upload_6RgrFm-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/l6X2MV\/upload_6RgrFm-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/l6X2MV\/upload_6RgrFm-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-07-01 12:19:23","updateDate":"2015-12-17 14:28:49","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"style":{"id":41,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Black Ale","shortName":"Black Ale","description":"American-style Black Ales are very dark to black and perceived to have medium high to high hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content, balanced with a medium body.

By the early 1980s, the last one had shuttered its doors. So when brothers Patrick and Daniel Conway opened Great Lakes Brewing Company on September 6, 1988, it not only signaled a new era in Cleveland brewing, it was also the first microbrewery in the state of Ohio. And the idea of a craft brewery in Cleveland caught on fast, as curious patrons hurried in for a pint crafted in the styles of old and drawn from the taps of the beautiful Victorian era bar. The company's commitment to sustainable business practices greatly contributed to its early popularity and success. Before long, Great Lakes Brewing Company had become one of Cleveland's most popular destinations for both dining and a fun night out.","website":"http:\/\/www.greatlakesbrewing.com\/","established":"1988","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/uSFO4T\/upload_tvVpPf-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/uSFO4T\/upload_tvVpPf-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/uSFO4T\/upload_tvVpPf-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/uSFO4T\/upload_tvVpPf-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/uSFO4T\/upload_tvVpPf-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:47:13","locations":[{"id":"8dIvZw","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1947 West 28th Street","locality":"Cleveland","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"44113","phone":"216-771-4404","website":"http:\/\/www.greatlakesbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday - Thursday: 11:30 AM - 10:30 PM (bar open until 12:00 AM)\r\nFriday and Saturday: 11:30 AM - 11:30 PM (bar open until 1:00 AM)\r\nSundays: Closed","latitude":41.484295,"longitude":-81.705375,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1988","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"xSmsLL","name":"Great Lakes Brewpub","streetAddress":"2516 Market Avenue","locality":"Cleveland","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"44113","phone":"216-771-4404","website":"http:\/\/www.greatlakesbrewing.com\/brewpub\/around-the-brewpub","hoursOfOperation":"Monday - Thursday: 11:30 AM - 10:30 PM (bar open until 12:00 AM)\r\nFriday and Saturday: 11:30 AM - 11:30 PM (bar open until 1:00 AM)\r\nSundays: Closed","latitude":41.484446,"longitude":-81.704436,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-12-10 17:48:32","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"dg5rVR","name":"Brok\u00e1t 13","nameDisplay":"Brok\u00e1t 13","abv":"5","styleId":41,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-03-03 07:24:23","updateDate":"2016-03-03 19:36:43","style":{"id":41,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Black Ale","shortName":"Black Ale","description":"American-style Black Ales are very dark to black and perceived to have medium high to high hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content, balanced with a medium body.

So enjoy an Empyrean beer, the taste of dreams come true.","website":"http:\/\/www.empyreanbrewingco.com\/","established":"1990","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/dN5GFB\/upload_f53gdB-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/dN5GFB\/upload_f53gdB-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/dN5GFB\/upload_f53gdB-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/dN5GFB\/upload_f53gdB-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/dN5GFB\/upload_f53gdB-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:45:28","locations":[{"id":"kpdGGu","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"729 Q Street","locality":"Lincoln","region":"Nebraska","postalCode":"68508","phone":"402-434-5959","website":"http:\/\/www.empyreanbrewingco.com\/","latitude":40.8158011,"longitude":-96.7106424,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1990","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"vqph2C","name":"Main Brewery","isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2015-02-12 13:22:55","updateDate":"2015-02-12 17:15:36","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"AdX4kX","name":"Cascade Session Black IPA","nameDisplay":"Cascade Session Black IPA","description":"Our Cascade Session Black IPA begins with a wintery nose of pine, chocolate, and citrus.
