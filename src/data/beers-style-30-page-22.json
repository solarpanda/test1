Paul and Remy have over thirty years of combined experience in the wine industry. The old saying, \"it takes a lot of beer to make wine\" rings especially true for these long-time friends who have been brewing together since 2004, when they worked the grape harvest in New Zealand. Remy went on to study brewing at UC Davis and has experience working at a number of local breweries. Paul has been working at his family's winery in Dry Creek Valley since 2005.\r\n\r\nSonoma County was once one of the largest hop growing regions in the nation, but all that remains today are the ghostly shells of old hop-kilns. Paul has been experimenting with growing hops for years. This year, Paul and Remy hope to harvest 500 vines from hop yards in Sonoma County.","website":"http:\/\/fogbeltbrewing.com\/","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/sgkKky\/upload_z1V2oo-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/sgkKky\/upload_z1V2oo-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/sgkKky\/upload_z1V2oo-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/sgkKky\/upload_z1V2oo-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/sgkKky\/upload_z1V2oo-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-02-11 17:41:54","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:51:11","locations":[{"id":"jRzF7z","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1305 Cleveland Ave.","locality":"Santa Rosa","region":"California","postalCode":"95401","phone":"(707) 978-3400","website":"http:\/\/www.fogbeltbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Thursday 2-8pm\r\nFriday and Saturday 11-10pm\r\nSunday 11-8pm","latitude":38.448869,"longitude":-122.7265397,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-02-11 23:37:51","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"WLgwbA","name":"Del's Relentless 4 Als","nameDisplay":"Del's Relentless 4 Als","abv":"4.3","styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/WLgwbA\/upload_fYG7fo-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/WLgwbA\/upload_fYG7fo-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/WLgwbA\/upload_fYG7fo-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-06-19 12:21:58","updateDate":"2015-12-17 14:39:39","style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery. Goose Island beers are now enjoyed in all 50 states and Europe.","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:46:51","locations":[{"id":"S2n5TB","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1800 West Fulton Street","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60612","phone":"1-800-466-7363","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","latitude":41.887107,"longitude":-87.6720969,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:33:51","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"D2gG2C","name":"Clybourn","streetAddress":"1800 North Clybourn Avenue","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60614","phone":"800-466-7363","latitude":41.9137242,"longitude":-87.65373,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1988","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:32:55","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Q4buPP","name":"Denunciation Triple IPA","nameDisplay":"Denunciation Triple IPA","description":"And i will pour out upon you my denunciation.

Those of you who saw the old brewery may remember the retrofitted dairy equipment we used. We held on to two of those tanks in our move to the East Asheville location. Alongside them, we have new fermentation and brite beer tanks to go with our 50-barrel brew house. Our pilot brew house is a brewer's playground for developing new seasonal beers, high gravity brews, and whatever else the brewers dream up.
