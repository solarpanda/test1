In our seven vessel brewhouse, we use a time consuming, multi-temperature decoction mash technique which extracts a more complex flavor from our grains.\r\n\r\nWe produce a gambit of hand-crafted Belgian style ales right here in Austin, Texas. With our vast array of beer styles, you're sure to find a brew that suits you.\r\n \r\nOur Belgian-Style Ales include:\r\nNaked Nun Wit\r\nBlack Rhino Black Ale\r\nScratchin' Hippo Biere de Garde\r\nPhilosophizer Saison\r\nDancin' Monks Dubbel Ale\r\nTripel B Tripel Ale\r\nThe Traveler Belgian IPA\r\nFlyin' Monks Quadrupel Ale\r\n \r\nAlso, look for our Barrel-Aged \"Vintage Series\" where we age one of our eight ales in oak barrels for an extended period of time.\r\n\r\nAlthough our selection of beer is great to enjoy by itself; each of them also pair perfectly with just about any food. From spicy Thai food to a backyard barbecue with ribs and brisket, to a formal dinner with steak or seafood and a dark chocolate dessert; our artisanal Belgian-style ales go with pretty much everything.

The beautiful hand-carved, hand-split Philippine mahogany bar was created to serve the whiskey distilled on the second floor. The saloon enjoyed a brisk business from the turn of the century until the advent of prohibition in 1920. The building, rich in history, is on the national registry of historic landmarks and has been restored to much of its original grandeur. Among the original architectural elements that remain today are the beautiful bar, intricate mosaic tile floor, much of the stained glass and of course the decorative ceiling. The luxurious back-bar won the coveted blue ribbon for craftsmanship at the 1893 World Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Many myths and legends surround this historic building, including the presence of ghosts and spirits.

An accomplished home brewer since 1995, Yager has designed numerous seasonal and specialty batches, from the Dark Hammer Belgian Quad to the UberAlt sticke ale. Other recurring ales are more experimental, blending styles, as with Tobacco Road, an imperial amber designed to complement a good cigar, or the occasional Lonesome Hop series, which spotlights the character of an individual hop. Yellowhammer is Yager's first commercial undertaking.\r\n\r\nYellowhammer Brewing opened on Oct. 16, 2010 with the best-selling Belgian white ale and the IPA.

Thus, Harvest Moon Brewing set up operations in Belt, a rural community located 20 miles southeast of Great Falls.  Harvest Moon's first batches were available in late 1997.  Soon after, the brewery developed a reputation for a well-balanced, full-bodied beer that only quality ingredients in perfect amounts could produce.  The barley is grown and malted just a few miles from the brewery while the malted wheat and hops come from the Northwest. \r\n\r\nThe brewery uses modern, state-of-the-art brewing equipment but is still a \"hands-on\" system, which allows brewery owners Stan and John to ensure high production quality.  They oversee every step of the process, from malt handling to mashing, from wort transfer to yeast pitching, from fermentation to conditioning, and from packaging to shipping.  The fine attention to detail assures consistency of production and ultimately a great-tasting craft beer!Belt, Montana, is located 15 minutes southeast of Great Falls, and is home to about 700 fantastic Montanans. Harvest Moon Brewing Company calls Belt home and has named their wheat, Belgian-style ale, Beltian White, after the town.\r\n\r\nBelt is also strategically located above one of the purest sources of water. Wells tap into the Madison Formation where constant year-round temperature and quality allow Harvest Moon to use some of the most perfect water on Earth to brew beer.\r\n\r\nAnother great thing about Belt? They are located in the center of our great state, right in the middle of the grain-growers that supply our brewery with prime barley & wheat. Harvest Moon\u2019s ties to the farming community don\u2019t end there\u2026after we use the grains, we supply the spent mash to a local pig farmer to feed his hogs. Hence the name, Pigs Ass Porter.

Our passion for beer and diversity of tastes allowed us to craft carefully refined recipes that we know will delight you.\r\n\r\nWe chose Fountain Square because of the community. Since we will be the first to admit our creativity and talents exist on a side of the brain that has little capability to draw, we have this admiration and attraction to those whose talents reside in the arts. We have connected to this community over the past year and look forward to being a vehicle for expressing its artistic nature. Fountain Square is a community of hard working, creative, fun loving, and genuine people. They are probably the most helpful people we've ever met. We are truly honored to be a part of the community and will strive to be worthy ambassadors and stewards.","website":"http:\/\/www.fountainsquarebrewery.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/f78xIY\/upload_jbPLiV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/f78xIY\/upload_jbPLiV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/f78xIY\/upload_jbPLiV-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/f78xIY\/upload_jbPLiV-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/f78xIY\/upload_jbPLiV-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-04-16 19:49:52","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:28:59","locations":[{"id":"N1ToDA","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1301 Barth Ave.","locality":"Indianapolis","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"46203","phone":"317.493.1410","hoursOfOperation":"Thursday - 4pm to 9pm\r\nFriday - 4pm to 10pm\r\nSaturday - 2pm to 10pm\r\nSunday - Noon - 6pm","latitude":39.749645,"longitude":-86.140794,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-04-16 19:54:28","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"nUPFrF","name":"Belgian Wit","nameDisplay":"Belgian Wit","styleId":65,"isOrganic":"Y","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-07-22 22:53:13","updateDate":"2015-07-22 22:53:13","style":{"id":65,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style White (or Wit) \/ Belgian-Style Wheat","shortName":"Witbier","description":"Belgian white ales are very pale in color and are brewed using unmalted wheat and malted barley and are spiced with coriander and orange peel.
