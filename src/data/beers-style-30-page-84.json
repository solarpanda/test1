Always looking to take a good thing too far, we sat down and over a beer (or two) decided that beer itself was a good idea. Of course, not just some easy-drinking institutional prole beer, but stuff like the beers we'd had at great bars. We had frequented places with extensive and varied beer lists. Places with lists 180 items long, all of which we tried twice (not in one night). In short, we wanted beer with flavor. Complexity. Character. Intensity. Not words found in the mass market lexicon.\r\n\r\nSo with a banjo burner, a bunch of industrial kitchen sized pots and as many buckets as we could find, we jumped in feet first. Once a week, every week. We tried to emulate the beers we liked, but soon we were adding a little of this, or some of that and after a while we started having a hard time pegging our beer in a style category. Our first success was a Porter that was mainly porter, slightly stout. We ran it blind with our friends against the porters we liked and people liked it. \"We're on to something\", we thought. Twenty iterations, modifications and tweaks later it is Distorter, and is still our favorite beer.\r\n\r\nThis led to twice a week brewing and handing out bottle after bottle to everyone we knew. Along the way we screwed up a wheat beer by accidentally making it into sort of a copper ale with a few too many hops. And so Red Bud Ale was born. We had some extra noble hops and threw them in the IPA, and with some tinkering we most certainly had a one-of-a-kind IPA. You get the picture. All of this has firmly cemented our \"anything goes\" approach to beer making. Our inability to ever get quite within the style guidelines means we may never win an award, but we're ok with that.\r\n\r\nNow, several years later and with a 90% super-cool\/10% Rube Goldberg 7 bbl version of our banjo burner and kitchen pots, we're befuddling the beer judges and converting the masses. One pint at a time.\r\n\r\nStop in the storefront and try our mainstays, seasonals and small-batch runs. Not to mention our lab beers, where we continue to screw up one thing or another in search of the next great beer.","website":"http:\/\/www.greenbushbrewing.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:19:53","locations":[{"id":"AlhRYb","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"5885 Sawyer Rd.","locality":"Sawyer","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49125","phone":"269-405-1076","website":"http:\/\/www.greenbushbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sunday - Thursday: 12-8\r\nFriday and Saturday: 12-10","latitude":41.8856286,"longitude":-86.5946671,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Q03a5y","name":"Star of India IPA","nameDisplay":"Star of India IPA","description":"A variety of malts and generous doses of hops throughout the brewing and fermentation process creates a big-bodied brew with a citrus nose and satisfying, clean finishing bitterness.","abv":"6.7","availableId":1,"styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/Q03a5y\/upload_cM9QqM-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/Q03a5y\/upload_cM9QqM-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/Q03a5y\/upload_cM9QqM-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-07-21 22:08:17","updateDate":"2015-12-18 04:22:03","available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

Brewing to style is not our objective; we prefer to focus our explorations on the potential of beer.\r\n\r\nBut we\u2019re more than just brewing, we\u2019ve got good food to boot. The Prodigal Son features a menu that combines traditional pub fare with scratch cooking. Here you will find regional ingredients incorporated into handcrafted cuisine. We have a bona fide chef with an artist\u2019s muse- and his work is truly the product of inspiration. Our food is unique \u2013you might even say it has character.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re proud to be back home, here in Eastern Oregon. Come visit anytime, and stay as long as you like. We hope you will join us on our journey to beervana. Lucky for you, your efforts will be rewarded with good beer.","website":"http:\/\/prodigalsonbrewery.com\/","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/oyY213\/upload_2P5Jx9-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/oyY213\/upload_2P5Jx9-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/oyY213\/upload_2P5Jx9-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/oyY213\/upload_2P5Jx9-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/oyY213\/upload_2P5Jx9-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-05-22 12:54:09","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:29:25","locations":[{"id":"h3bxBv","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"230 SE Court Ave","locality":"Pendleton","region":"Oregon","postalCode":"97801","phone":"541-276-6090","website":"http:\/\/prodigalsonbrewery.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Tue - Thu: 11:00 am - 10:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:00 am - 11:00 pm\r\nSun: 12:00 pm - 9:00 pm","latitude":45.673343,"longitude":-118.785254,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2010","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-05-22 12:55:36","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"JfhBNh","name":"Stash IPA","nameDisplay":"Stash IPA","description":"Stash IPA is defined by its blend of hops.

They first met during graduate school at the University of Minnesota where the fates would have it, they joined the same chemistry research group.  The guys spent many a night proving the adage of their PhD (piled higher & deeper) advisor, \u201cThe true test of running a scientific instrument is being able to operate it after a few beers.\u201d  After graduation, Grant and Phil pursued different career paths, Grant went the academic route, while Phil initially started out in the chemical industry, but then wised up and conned people into hiring him as a beer then wine chemist.  After a few years of chasing the academic and corporate dollar, the boys wised up and decided to strike out on their own.  They landed in Vancouver, WA (which was the first Vancouver, by the way) and started up Dirty Hands Brewing Company.  From the start, their goal was to brew full flavored beers that were both balanced and highly drinkable.  So, they set to work, getting their hands dirty renovating the space that was the old Columbian Newspaper building to a working brewery and taproom.  Speaking of the newspaper, that\u2019s how the name came about.  Think of reading a hard copy paper and how your hands would look from getting newsprint all over them!  The brewery also strives to honor the working past of Vancouver and Washington state by using locally sourced ingredients in the beer and food that we serve.","website":"http:\/\/dirtyhandsbrewing.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ywrnRJ\/upload_Bm95vm-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ywrnRJ\/upload_Bm95vm-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ywrnRJ\/upload_Bm95vm-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ywrnRJ\/upload_Bm95vm-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ywrnRJ\/upload_Bm95vm-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-23 02:20:26","updateDate":"2016-06-08 20:01:30","locations":[{"id":"UfTXZT","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"114 E.

Our brewing process utilizes the traditional English method of upward infusion mashing in our combination mash lauter tun to create lagers and ales inspired by old world values, but with modern quality and consistency. The staff at The Lion Brewery is dedicated to producing true handcrafted beers, made right here in our century-old Brewhouse. All of our premium beers are made using only the four basic ingredients allowed by the Reinheitsgebot, or German purity law. Under the skillful supervision of our Master Brewer, Leo Orlandini, each of our lagers and ales are brewed in small batches using only the finest hops and malts available to guarantee the highest quality and freshness. Each product we brew is an original recipe especially created to deliver a fuller flavor than ordinary beers, yet with an approachable style and character. As a result, our beers have garnered numerous medals from the Great American Beer Festival and the World Beer Championships in recent years.\r\n\r\nIn 1974 the Lion Brewing Company bought the Stegmaier Brand.","website":"http:\/\/www.lionbrewery.com\/","established":"1857","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TwOeWu\/upload_VQOP01-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TwOeWu\/upload_VQOP01-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TwOeWu\/upload_VQOP01-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TwOeWu\/upload_VQOP01-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TwOeWu\/upload_VQOP01-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:00","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:50:50","locations":[{"id":"z0gnmN","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"700 North Pennsylvania Blvd.","locality":"Wilkes Barre","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"18705","phone":"800-233-8327","website":"http:\/\/www.lionbrewery.com\/","latitude":41.2556575,"longitude":-75.858261,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1857","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:00","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"cxzpeu","name":"Stella Careless Whisper","nameDisplay":"Stella Careless Whisper","abv":"7","styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-08-11 22:50:06","updateDate":"2014-08-12 12:07:09","style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

This beer is loaded with all of the big citrus and fruity flavors American hops can offer.","abv":"6.5","ibu":"70","availableId":2,"styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/eTyc56\/upload_Dr8SUQ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/eTyc56\/upload_Dr8SUQ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/eTyc56\/upload_Dr8SUQ-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-01-06 17:32:14","updateDate":"2015-12-17 21:02:49","available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

We take pride in our hands on, mom and pop approach and the energy we put into the quality of our beer, food, staff, customers and facilities. We believe in the power of the smallness.   We intend on remaining a smaller, state wide beer distributor and focusing our energies close to home (the SBC Michigan stimulus package).

However, when it comes to the Stone Anniversary Ales, it's all us. Yet, it is indeed still a collaboration with great creative brewers (if we do say so ourselves). We're talking about our own brewing team, of course. And while some of our beers, anniversary and otherwise, have been designed by a single person, the Stone 16th Anniversary IPA was definitely a team effort.\r\n\r\nThis year our brewing team was inspired by some exotic-ish additions of the lemony persuasion. Yes, it's a Double IPA (can you really say you're surprised?), but as we strive to do with all our Stone Anniversary Ales of the let's-take-this-IPA-in-a-new-direction variety, we've brewed up a Stone-worthy divergence from tradition. The amount of rye malt we used isn't quite enough to warrant the appellation \"Rye IPA,\" but it still adds hints of spiciness that contrast deliciously with the tropical fruit flavors and aromas of the Amarillo and Calypso hops. Add a few European specialty malts, some lemon verbena, and three more hop varieties to the mix, and you have a highly complex brew melding both bitter and fruity hop notes with rich toasted malt character punctuated by nuances of spicy rye and subtle lemon.","abv":"10","ibu":"85","glasswareId":6,"availableId":2,"styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/FCj67Q\/upload_XURtt8-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/FCj67Q\/upload_XURtt8-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/FCj67Q\/upload_XURtt8-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-25 20:01:52","updateDate":"2015-12-16 19:09:40","glass":{"id":6,"name":"Snifter","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.
