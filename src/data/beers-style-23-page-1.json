These days it is only produced by three major breweries in Ireland, none of them Irish-owned, though several small breweries and brewpubs make stout as well. People are often surprised to hear that Irish stouts are among the lightest beers on draft, both in alcohol and in calories. These beers were originally designed as \u201csession pints\u201d, a term denoting beers that one can stick with for a long evening. These days, the major producers of Irish Stout dissolve nitrogen into the beer to produce the trademark head, a practice that started in 1960.\r\nBrooklyn Irish Stout is brewed the old-fashioned way, without the nitrogen addition. A large portion of the grain is roasted like coffee beans, developing the typical color and flavor of this beer. Aside from British pale malts, the beer includes caramel malts, black patent malt, unmalted black barley and a proportion of flaked raw barley, which helps the beer develop a beautiful, thick natural head. The famous East Kent Golding hop lends to the earthy aroma. The beer is neither filtered, nor fined and has a light, brisk carbonation. The blend of grains gives the beer an espresso-like bite, followed by coffee and chocolate flavors. At 4.2% ABV, this is among the lightest beers we make, and one of our favorites. Be sure to serve it with \u201ctwo fingers\u201d of foam, and enjoy the flavor of Brooklyn Irish Stout.

At the end of the day, here in the brewery, it is all about our microscopic wild friends.","website":"http:\/\/www.artifactbeer.com\/","established":"2015","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TJyuyR\/upload_1P5RNO-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TJyuyR\/upload_1P5RNO-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TJyuyR\/upload_1P5RNO-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TJyuyR\/upload_1P5RNO-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TJyuyR\/upload_1P5RNO-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-05-20 19:28:49","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:09:09","locations":[{"id":"hSB1eG","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1660 Blue Rock St.","locality":"Cincinnati","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45223","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  4:00pm - 12:00am\nTue:  4:00pm - 12:00am\nWed:  4:00pm - 12:00am\nThu:  4:00pm - 12:00am\nFri:  4:00pm - 1:30am\nSat:  12:00pm - 1:30am\nSun:  12:00pm - 12:00am\n\n","latitude":39.1604192,"longitude":-84.5423262,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-05-26 17:29:26","updateDate":"2015-05-26 17:31:25","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"XViYB0","name":"Celtic Fury","nameDisplay":"Celtic Fury","description":"First brewed in 2005, this traditional Irish Stout calms the ire of the clans with it\u2019s delicious roast coffee aroma, smooth, creamy mouthfeel, and exquisitely dry finish with subtle notes of coffee and chocolate.
