We think we\u2019ve met that goal, & hope you\u2019ll agree.\r\n\r\nAt Aftershock, we believe there are two different approaches to brewing.  The most common approach used by the major breweries is a \u2018scientific one\u2019.  All stages of the brewing process are closely monitored to ensure a consistent, if tasteless product.  Computers and other high tech equipment are more in control than the brewer himself.  With this approach you get \u2018scientific\u2019 beer.  The other approach is a more artistic one, while still respecting basic laws of science, and the need for spotless cleanliness.  That\u2019s the approach we plan to always take at Aftershock.  At the risk of losing an undetectable amount of consistency, the result is beer with much more character, subtle nuances, and awesome flavor.

The three talked about that it was too bad that you could not get some decent beer and agreed that the only way to ensure quality was about to brew it yourself. They were allowed to borrow the canteen in the school's closing and began to brew. This meant however that most of the brew was made between the hours of 22 and 6 on weekdays, which resulted in some hard school day for both the two pupils and the teacher, but the beer was appreciated by all the school (near the school cafeteria, which grumbled over filth ).\r\n\r\nLater created Mikkel brewery Mikkeller , which has garnered wide international recognition, while Tobias and Tore moved their production into their parents' basement after they were dropped out of high school. Here they continued to hand brew until in 2010 found that two beers were now ripe to make its first commercial brew.

You may better remember the building as the former home of the Shanghai Restaurant and bar, where scenes from the movie, Phenomenon were filmed.\r\n\r\nThe ambiance of the Auburn Alehouse combines the charm and character of this historic brick and mortar building with the bold industrial elements of a gleaming 10-barrel microbrewery.\r\n\r\nGuests and friends can enjoy lunch, dinner, and libation while watching the freshly crafted beer they are drinking being produced just a few feet away.\r\n\r\nThere is also an outdoor patio with a great view of the historic Auburn courthouse. There are always at least 6-8 beers on tap and Hard Cider and select \"guest\" craft beers are also available on draught. Interestingly, the Auburn Alehouse is located just 1\/10th of a mile from the original Auburn Brewery, which brewed for thirsty Auburnites from 1855 until 1908. You may stop by for the ale, but you\u2019ll find the food is a star attraction as well. Whether you\u2019re in the mood for pub fare or a sit down dinner, there is something for every one at the Alehouse.","website":"http:\/\/www.auburnalehouse.com\/","established":"2007","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/iQmBa8\/upload_qwMesB-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/iQmBa8\/upload_qwMesB-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/iQmBa8\/upload_qwMesB-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/iQmBa8\/upload_qwMesB-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/iQmBa8\/upload_qwMesB-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2016-04-10 21:24:24","locations":[{"id":"UOmjKJ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"289 Washington Street","locality":"Auburn","region":"California","postalCode":"95603","phone":"530-885-2537","website":"http:\/\/www.auburnalehouse.com\/","latitude":38.8949179,"longitude":-121.078789,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"TOvtI8","name":"Forbidden Island","nameDisplay":"Forbidden Island","description":"Double IPA brewed with New Zealand hops.","abv":"10","ibu":"60","glasswareId":8,"srmId":5,"availableId":4,"styleId":31,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/TOvtI8\/upload_GVKPL8-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/TOvtI8\/upload_GVKPL8-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/TOvtI8\/upload_GVKPL8-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-08-18 17:38:36","updateDate":"2015-12-18 03:46:33","glass":{"id":8,"name":"Tulip","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"srm":{"id":5,"name":"5","hex":"FBB123"},"available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":31,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ale","shortName":"Imperial IPA","description":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma.

They devised a plan to build a brewery in beautiful Birmingham \u2013 Alabama.\r\n\r\nThe group found an excellent location for the brewery in the Pepper Place\/Lakeview district of Birmingham on 3rd Avenue South.  The 8000 Square foot building houses the brewery and tasting room.  The building was selected for it\u2019s location, layout, and opportunity for expansion.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning, Cahaba Brewing Company has had the goal of providing Birmingham with clean and consistent craft beers with a broad variety flavors and styles.  To do this, CBC hand selected and assembled the brewing equipment necessary for the job.  As luck would have it, our friends at Straight To Ale, in Huntsville, AL were in the process of upgrading their brewery and they had just purchased all of the equipment from Old Town Brewery.  After purchasing their equipment, we were just about ready to go.  The set-up consists of a Premier Stainless 3.5 bbl brewhouse outfitted with four 7 bbl fermenters and two 7 bbl brite tanks.\r\n\r\nCahaba continued to grow and found a new location to begin the expansion process in early 2015. Celebrating \"Last Pint Night\" at the original 3rd Ave South location in mid-January 2016, the new 51,000 square foot building, located in the Historical Continental Gin, is ready to open. First day to officially open was January 19th, 2016. Not only is the space much larger, the production facility is also expanding from a 3.5 bbl brewhouse to a 30 bbl brewhouse. The new set up consists of three 60 bbl brite tanks and one 120 bbl brite tank. In addition, the 3.5 bbl system from the original building will join the larger tanks at the new facility and will be used for smaller batches. Cahaba will also begin canning various styles of beer in-house. These cans will join the already launched American Blonde that went into the local market in early 2015. The new taproom offers a window looking into the production facility, a covered patio, and ample parking.
