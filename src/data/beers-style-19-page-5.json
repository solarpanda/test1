Our mantra is big, bold flavors, made exactingly with natural ingredients. So, for example, if we say a beer will taste like peanut butter and jelly, you can be sure you\u2019ll smell and taste the fresh roasted peanuts and fruity berry jam. Our flagship beers such as Hop Gun IPA and Floridian Hefeweizen, also strive towards big, bold flavor. It\u2019s who we are.\r\n\r\nOur Brewery is located in the heart of Oakland Park\u2019s new Culinary Arts District. The 20,000 sq-ft facility is powered by a 30-barrel, three-piece brewhouse, which feeds nearly 1000 gallons of beer per batch into our four 60-barrel fermenters - a capacity that makes us South Florida\u2019s largest craft microbrewery. Each of our distinctive beers is brewed using the finest, all-natural ingredients, then served up unpasteurized, unfiltered, and unfussed with. We offer tours of our 20,000 sq-ft facility, rotating food trucks nightly, and growlers of our brewery fresh beer to-go.\r\n\r\nYou can sample our creations in our spacious tap room - open 7 days a week, noon to midnight - as well as in bars and restaurants all across South Florida. And of course, we still brew at our original location in Boca Raton, the Funky Buddha Brewery & Lounge, which has become a test kitchen for our more experimental brews.\r\n\r\nSee you soon for a pint!

Did you know that in ancient times beer was the safest way to drink water? This is because beers have a long duration without spoiling due to microorganisms responsible for fermentation yeasts. These can overlap with agents that invade their surroundings, beer, killing them. Due to the lower alcohol content does not lead to dehydration as much as other alcoholic beverages. Thus one Brew is valid for drinking from about 1 year. The most interesting is that adequately conditioned beers, depending on the style, last up to five or even more years in the most extreme cases. Our all beers last more than 1 year but because the properties change with time, to better almost always guarantee only that period to enjoy what described on the label.\r\n\r\nHow do fermentation in the bottle always guarantee that the beer will live yeast to the consumer, which on the one hand clears the beer and the other creates gas in it. Because of this fermentation in the bottle our beers have always deposit.

The original brewery was built by Nick and Simon in a run down warehouse located in Hammond, Indiana. The first beers brewed by the brothers were designed to be a departure from the fairly bleak craft brewing scene in the region. Nick and Simon brewed intense balanced beers that were and still remain \u201cnot normal\u201d by conventional standards.\r\n\r\nIn November of 2005, after receiving numerous visitors to the brewery over the years, Three Floyds opened its own brewpub at the production facility. What was once office space is now a refuge for the craft beer enthusiast. With all the Three Floyds mainstays, seasonal offerings, special small batch beers and many guest beers it is a mecca for craft beer.

Specifically, this is a chocolate porter dry-hopped with bacon (dry-baconed?), with a name continuing to pay homage to one Mr. Christopher Wallace.
