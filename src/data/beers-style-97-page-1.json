Recognizing a need and an opportunity, he committed to rectify this situation. In 1986, Schirf opened the first brewery in the resort town of Park City and named his beers after the majestic Wasatch Mountains that rise just east of Salt Lake City. In July 1989, Schirf Brewing opened its new company headquarters and the first brew pub in Utah at the top of historic Main Street in Park City.\r\n\r\nIn fact, it was Schirf who proposed the bill to the Utah Legislature in 1988 that would make brew pubs legal in Utah. There are now more than 12 thriving brew pubs in the state thanks to Schirf and the bill's sponsor, Senator Mike Demeitrick of Price, Utah.","website":"http:\/\/www.utahbeers.com\/","established":"1986","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ZGY8Zy\/upload_uPIgaj-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ZGY8Zy\/upload_uPIgaj-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ZGY8Zy\/upload_uPIgaj-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ZGY8Zy\/upload_uPIgaj-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ZGY8Zy\/upload_uPIgaj-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:01:47","locations":[{"id":"q3a5ty","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1763 South 300 West","locality":"Salt Lake City","region":"Utah","postalCode":"84115","phone":"801-466-8855","website":"http:\/\/www.utahbeers.com\/","latitude":40.7322287,"longitude":-111.8996689,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1986","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"6zuO0f","name":"405 Oklahoma Lager","nameDisplay":"405 Oklahoma Lager","abv":"6","glasswareId":5,"styleId":97,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:37","updateDate":"2012-03-22 13:05:39","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"style":{"id":97,"categoryId":8,"category":{"id":8,"name":"North American Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"American-Style Premium Lager","shortName":"American Premium Lager","description":"This style has low malt (and adjunct) sweetness, is medium bodied, and should contain no or a low percentage (less than 25%) of adjuncts.

While large macro-breweries compete to produce the lightest, most flavorless, adjunct laden beers possible, craft breweries strive to out-do one another by making each beer hoppier, bolder, and stronger than the next.  At Brevard Brewing Company, we have set out to give beer lovers the best of both worlds \u2013 beer that is both drinkable and flavorful.  We are the only brewery in Western North Carolina to specialize in lagers. \r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s the big deal about lagers? Lagers are cold-fermented and aged over twice as long as ales.  They are more costly to produce, and take more patience to brew. Unlike the big flavors of ales that hide imperfections, lagers demand a higher standard of quality and care, making them a rare find in the craft beer world.  But the result is worth the attention to detail--this painstaking process creates a beer that is clean, smooth, and crisp as opposed to the bold, complex flavor of ales.  The imported German barley, hops, and yeast delivers delicate and refined beers that are delicious and flavorful, yet supremely drinkable.\r\n\r\nWhile German-inspired lagers are my specialty, I will never forget the wonderful contributions that American home brewers have made to the beer world over the past thirty years.  I typically find myself drinking a cold, smooth, Pilsner, but every now and again, my taste buds crave a bold, hoppy American IPA.  This is why Brevard Brewing Company offers American ales in addition to German lagers.  No matter your mood or what you are craving, we have the right beer for you.","website":"http:\/\/www.brevard-brewing.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/enoxkn\/upload_efjDQ2-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/enoxkn\/upload_efjDQ2-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/enoxkn\/upload_efjDQ2-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/enoxkn\/upload_efjDQ2-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/enoxkn\/upload_efjDQ2-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-15 23:03:43","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:28:05","locations":[{"id":"ktgW91","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"63 East Main Street","locality":"Brevard","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"28712","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\nTue:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\nWed:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\nThu:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\nFri:  2:00pm - 12:00am\nSat:  2:00pm - 12:00am\nSun:  2:00pm - 9:00pm\n\nMonday-Thursday:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\r\nFriday & Saturday: 2:00pm - 12:00am\r\nSunday: 2:00pm - 9:00pm","latitude":35.2333243,"longitude":-82.7333116,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-15 23:04:50","updateDate":"2014-09-29 20:36:32","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"n3kdur","name":"American Wheat","nameDisplay":"American Wheat","styleId":97,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:42","updateDate":"2012-03-22 13:04:45","style":{"id":97,"categoryId":8,"category":{"id":8,"name":"North American Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"American-Style Premium Lager","shortName":"American Premium Lager","description":"This style has low malt (and adjunct) sweetness, is medium bodied, and should contain no or a low percentage (less than 25%) of adjuncts.

Rogue closed its Ashland operation in 1997, after the great flood destroyed the place. In 1991, the 15bbl system, named Howard after John Maier's former boss, from the Newport brewpub was transferred across the bay to the current brewery and upgraded to a 30bbl system. In 1998 Rogue bought a 50bbl brewsystem, named Kobe. Kobe is the only brewsystem in use. Tours: We offer brewery tours every day at 3 pm (followed by a distillery tour at 4pm).

Word of this spring spread and became a regular stop for all settlers going west on the Red River Trail. In 1857 Swiss born naturalist Armond DuPont wrote, \u201cit is a water like no other, unique in its ability to refresh.\u201d He noted, \u201cThough seemingly impossible, a year-round frost forms at the base of this amazing spring.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe brewery was built at the site of the spring and its water became the basis of all the award winning brews for over 125 years. In addition, the brewery has become the #1 energy drink and specialty drink producer in the country.

Since then, the Central PA natives have been handcrafting world-class beers that blend traditional brewing techniques with the innovation and eclecticism of the American craft brewing movement. Today, the Hershey, PA-based brewery produces six year-round beers (Hopback Amber Ale, Troegenator Double Bock, JavaHead Stout, Tr\u00f6egs Pale Ale, DreamWeaver Wheat, and Perpetual IPA); four seasonal releases as part of the Hop Cycle series (Cultivator Helles Bock, Sunshine Pils, Hop Knife Harvest Ale, and Blizzard of Hops Winter IPA); and two limited beers (Nugget Nectar and Mad Elf Ale). \r\n\r\nIn addition to these beers, Tr\u00f6egs produces a variety of experimental, small batch beers as part of its Scratch Beer Series. These beers are available exclusively at the brewery and most are draft-only limited releases, although some popular Scratch Beers (Fresh Hop Ale, Fest Lager, etc.) are bottled for release through the General Store at the brewery. \r\n\r\nIn late 2013, Tr\u00f6egs introduced a special line of cork & cage bottle releases. The first, LaGrave, is available year-round. Master of Pumpkins was also released in 2013 and will continue with availability in the fall. Other beers such as Jovial have since followed suit. The addition of a canning line not only offers the brewery more flexibility in the way it presents its beers, but also allows Tr\u00f6egs to provide customers with more packaging options. To date, Tr\u00f6egs has released Perpetual IPA and Sunshine Pils in 12-ounce cans and Troegenator in 16-ounce cans. Plans to release other seasonal and limited beers in cans are currently in the works. \r\n\r\nThe Splinter Series is an extremely limited line of barrel-aged beers packaged in cork & cage bottles. While only a handful of these beers have been produced, Tr\u00f6egs plans to expand this series with the inclusion of Nebulous (barrel-aged LaGrave with Brett), bourbon barrel-aged Troegenator, and others. \r\n\r\nTr\u00f6egs currently distributes its beers throughout Delaware, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Washington D.C.
