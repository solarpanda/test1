How, you may ask, would a brewery determine a likeness to hard-coated custard? Our response is simple; it\u2019s all in the power of history, and of course, the extra finesse needed to top off a contentious treat with definition.\r\n\r\nBy comprehending the labyrinthine movement of time, one would not think it strange to trace the errant path of an ordinary object such as a cream dessert only to discover that it has been the cause of cultural disputes since the middle ages. The British founders of burnt cream and from Spain, crema catalana, both stand by their creative originality and we respect that, but it was the French Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e, amid the strife of contention, that survived to represent our deliciously creamy brew.","abv":"9.5","glasswareId":6,"srmId":41,"availableId":5,"styleId":20,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/Kax7jD\/upload_jvW8WY-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/Kax7jD\/upload_jvW8WY-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/Kax7jD\/upload_jvW8WY-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"vanilla custard, bananas foster, alone, or as a float with a scoop of organic vanilla ice cream","servingTemperature":"cool","servingTemperatureDisplay":"Cool - (8-12C\/45-54F)","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:02","updateDate":"2016-05-17 20:41:01","glass":{"id":6,"name":"Snifter","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"srm":{"id":41,"name":"Over 40","hex":"000000"},"available":{"id":5,"name":"Spring","description":"Available during the spring months."},"style":{"id":20,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Sweet or Cream Stout","shortName":"Sweet Stout","description":"Sweet stouts, also referred to as cream stouts, have less roasted bitter flavor and a full-bodied mouthfeel.

In 2003 Skip and Phin purchased the defunct Old Saddle Back Brewing Co. in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. All the equipment was removed and brought back to Lakewood, New York and set up at its new 10,000 square foot home, The Southern Tier Brewing Company. The Brewery began operations in February 2004 distributing regionally. By 2005 sales covered the majority of the New York State and the eastern half of Pennsylvania. In the beginning their two Flagship brands were a Pilsner and Mild Ale. Oh yeah they also brewed IPA! As it turned out the flagships were a flop and the IPA was a huge success. They next launched a line of seasonal beers which have gained great success. Since the beginning, Southern Tier has experienced steady growth, currently distributing to over 25% of the United States. Multiple expansions have been made to keep up with demand and the brewery continues to be innovative by producing new products.  Keep a look out for new products coming to stores near you.","website":"http:\/\/www.southerntierbrewing.com\/","established":"2002","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/x8kqVp\/upload_4gTXFP-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/x8kqVp\/upload_4gTXFP-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/x8kqVp\/upload_4gTXFP-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/x8kqVp\/upload_4gTXFP-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/x8kqVp\/upload_4gTXFP-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:58:38","locations":[{"id":"nUT6v5","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2072 Stoneman Circle","locality":"Lakewood","region":"New York","postalCode":"14750","phone":"716-763-5479","website":"http:\/\/www.southerntierbrewing.com\/","latitude":42.1008305,"longitude":-79.3356897,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2002","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2014-10-27 14:23:02","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"uIRyqS","name":"Cross Rabbit Milk Stout","nameDisplay":"Cross Rabbit Milk Stout","description":"Cross Rabbit beer was lovingly brewed with a combination of Belgian Yeast and a holiday collection Peeps marshmallow treat sugar bombs, Cadbury creme eggs, malted milk eggs, dark chocolate Easter bunnies, and black jelly beans.

The original Blue Mountain Brewery was created in 2007 by Taylor and Mandi Smack, Matt Nucci and a group of fearless shareholders. Blue Mountain introduced the concept of the rural brewery to our corner of the world and set the standard for great beer in Virginia. As the first production arm of the Blue Mountain family, the Barrel House focuses on the higher-end beers from Blue Mountain that require special processes, special ingredients, and a whole lot of patience.","website":"http:\/\/www.bluemountainbarrel.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/LMfC4N\/upload_DnDBSD-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/LMfC4N\/upload_DnDBSD-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/LMfC4N\/upload_DnDBSD-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/LMfC4N\/upload_DnDBSD-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/LMfC4N\/upload_DnDBSD-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-11-03 17:10:29","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:38:39","locations":[{"id":"RZvDv4","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"495 Cooperative Way","locality":"Arrington","region":"Virginia","postalCode":"22922","phone":"(434) 263-4002","website":"http:\/\/www.bluemountainbarrel.com\/","latitude":37.710313,"longitude":-78.94212,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-11-03 17:11:12","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"KaCW4E","name":"Dark Lightning Milk Stout","nameDisplay":"Dark Lightning Milk Stout","description":"Milk stout","abv":"5.5","styleId":20,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-10 16:48:42","updateDate":"2014-09-11 18:00:15","style":{"id":20,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Sweet or Cream Stout","shortName":"Sweet Stout","description":"Sweet stouts, also referred to as cream stouts, have less roasted bitter flavor and a full-bodied mouthfeel.

Rogue's first brewpub was located in Ashland, Oregon and was a 10bbl brewsystem. Rogue opened a second brewpub, 15bbl brewsystem, in May 1989 located in Newport, Oregon. Rogue closed its Ashland operation in 1997, after the great flood destroyed the place. In 1991, the 15bbl system, named Howard after John Maier's former boss, from the Newport brewpub was transferred across the bay to the current brewery and upgraded to a 30bbl system. In 1998 Rogue bought a 50bbl brewsystem, named Kobe. Kobe is the only brewsystem in use. Tours: We offer brewery tours every day at 3 pm (followed by a distillery tour at 4pm). Go up to the bar inside the brewery (Brewers on the Bay) and check in with the bartender and the tour will commence. Please call ahead if you have a large group and or to verify the tour time...Brewer's on the Bay phone is 541-867-3664.
