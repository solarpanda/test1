Rogue's first brewpub was located in Ashland, Oregon and was a 10bbl brewsystem. Rogue opened a second brewpub, 15bbl brewsystem, in May 1989 located in Newport, Oregon. Rogue closed its Ashland operation in 1997, after the great flood destroyed the place. In 1991, the 15bbl system, named Howard after John Maier's former boss, from the Newport brewpub was transferred across the bay to the current brewery and upgraded to a 30bbl system. In 1998 Rogue bought a 50bbl brewsystem, named Kobe. Kobe is the only brewsystem in use. Tours: We offer brewery tours every day at 3 pm (followed by a distillery tour at 4pm). Go up to the bar inside the brewery (Brewers on the Bay) and check in with the bartender and the tour will commence. Please call ahead if you have a large group and or to verify the tour time...Brewer's on the Bay phone is 541-867-3664.

While large macro-breweries compete to produce the lightest, most flavorless, adjunct laden beers possible, craft breweries strive to out-do one another by making each beer hoppier, bolder, and stronger than the next.  At Brevard Brewing Company, we have set out to give beer lovers the best of both worlds \u2013 beer that is both drinkable and flavorful.  We are the only brewery in Western North Carolina to specialize in lagers. \r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s the big deal about lagers? Lagers are cold-fermented and aged over twice as long as ales.  They are more costly to produce, and take more patience to brew. Unlike the big flavors of ales that hide imperfections, lagers demand a higher standard of quality and care, making them a rare find in the craft beer world.  But the result is worth the attention to detail--this painstaking process creates a beer that is clean, smooth, and crisp as opposed to the bold, complex flavor of ales.  The imported German barley, hops, and yeast delivers delicate and refined beers that are delicious and flavorful, yet supremely drinkable.\r\n\r\nWhile German-inspired lagers are my specialty, I will never forget the wonderful contributions that American home brewers have made to the beer world over the past thirty years.  I typically find myself drinking a cold, smooth, Pilsner, but every now and again, my taste buds crave a bold, hoppy American IPA.  This is why Brevard Brewing Company offers American ales in addition to German lagers.  No matter your mood or what you are craving, we have the right beer for you.","website":"http:\/\/www.brevard-brewing.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/enoxkn\/upload_efjDQ2-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/enoxkn\/upload_efjDQ2-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/enoxkn\/upload_efjDQ2-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/enoxkn\/upload_efjDQ2-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/enoxkn\/upload_efjDQ2-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-15 23:03:43","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:28:05","locations":[{"id":"ktgW91","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"63 East Main Street","locality":"Brevard","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"28712","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\nTue:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\nWed:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\nThu:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\nFri:  2:00pm - 12:00am\nSat:  2:00pm - 12:00am\nSun:  2:00pm - 9:00pm\n\nMonday-Thursday:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\r\nFriday & Saturday: 2:00pm - 12:00am\r\nSunday: 2:00pm - 9:00pm","latitude":35.2333243,"longitude":-82.7333116,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-15 23:04:50","updateDate":"2014-09-29 20:36:32","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"bMJTG2","name":"American-Style Amber Lager","nameDisplay":"American-Style Amber Lager","description":"Light copper-colored and medium bodied, this lager is brewed with imported German Pilsner and Munich malts.

Creative and interactive lighting permeates throughout the brewery and taproom featuring rotating artwork created by local artists. Custom programmed LED lighting allows us to change the lighting color and mood in real-time while our customers enjoy Kilowatt\u2019s unique beer styles in a one-of-a-kind taproom.\r\n\r\nKilowatt rotates in outside chefs and gourmet food trucks providing different styles of food and menus daily, while allowing you to experience select culinary items paired with complimentary styles of beer. For example an Asian style food truck will pair unique menu items with Kilowatt\u2019s Green Tea Ale, Coconut Chai Porter, or Goji Berry Mountain Honey Ale.","website":"http:\/\/kilowatt.beer\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ZPqTMf\/upload_xhLktu-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ZPqTMf\/upload_xhLktu-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ZPqTMf\/upload_xhLktu-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ZPqTMf\/upload_xhLktu-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ZPqTMf\/upload_xhLktu-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-05-09 03:14:11","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:08:42","locations":[{"id":"aEPyXT","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"7576 Clairemont Mesa Blvd","locality":"San Diego","region":"California","postalCode":"92111","website":"kilowatt.beer","latitude":32.8330858,"longitude":-117.1564851,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-05-09 03:14:12","updateDate":"2015-11-18 21:19:37","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"zKhXvH","name":"Angry Redhead","nameDisplay":"Angry Redhead","description":"Angry Redhead will punch you right in your mouth.
