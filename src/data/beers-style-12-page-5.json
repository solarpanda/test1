He had spent 20+ years in the Engineering field and was looking to make a change in careers and a change in outlook.  Having been homebrewing for a couple of years, Tom wrote a \u2018cartoon\u2019 of a business plan that stated that a 3 barrel brewery could make a profit (in the first year, no less!).\r\n\r\nArmed with said business plan and a cashed in 401k, Tom and his wife DeAnn proceeded to convert a metal storage shed on their property into a nascent brewery.\r\n\r\nLake Louie Brewing is located on 18.5 acres of land purchased from Tom\u2019s uncle Louie Carpenter (hence the name \u2018Lake Louie\u2019) near the small town of Arena, Wisconsin (population: not too many, traffic lights: zero).  Lake Louie was the skinny dipping pond for area youth (including Tom in his day).\r\n\r\nAt the end of one full year\u2019s brewing, Lake Louie has produced the astounding sum of 106 barrels of beer.  2001 year end totals:  276 barrels.

A Vanderbilt graduate, Mark spent eight years working in sports marketing and development before jumping into the beer world.  He\u2019s a tall guy.  \u201cCircus freak\u201d tall, according to an old lady at the Phoenix airport.  He loves barbecue.  Actually it\u2019s kind of an issue for him.\r\n\r\nMark got into craft beer on a family trip to Oregon in 2004.  The Oregon Brewers Festival opened his eyes to a whole new world of beer and he\u2019s been hooked ever since.\r\n\r\nShortly after moving back to Nashville in 2009, Mark got involved with the Oasis Center through his high school friend Anderson Williams.  After a couple of beers and some brainstorming on how to get the word out about Oasis, the idea for Jubilee came up.  In March of 2010, the first batch of Jubilee Nut Brown Ale hit the shelves in Middle Tennessee, thanks to the good folks at Bluegrass Brewing Company.  In January of 2013, Jubilee brought production closer to home, partnering with Mayday Brewery in Murfreesboro TN to release Randy\u2019s IPA.\r\n\r\nWho\u2019s Randy?

The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery. Goose Island beers are now enjoyed in all 50 states and Europe.","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:46:51","locations":[{"id":"S2n5TB","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1800 West Fulton Street","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60612","phone":"1-800-466-7363","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","latitude":41.887107,"longitude":-87.6720969,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:33:51","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"D2gG2C","name":"Clybourn","streetAddress":"1800 North Clybourn Avenue","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60614","phone":"800-466-7363","latitude":41.9137242,"longitude":-87.65373,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1988","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:32:55","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"pfxJGR","name":"Nut Brown Ale","nameDisplay":"Nut Brown Ale","description":"A malty sweet ale, with a nutty, toffee flavored finish.","glasswareId":5,"styleId":12,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:47","updateDate":"2012-03-22 13:05:35","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"style":{"id":12,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"English-Style Brown Ale","shortName":"English Brown","description":"English brown ales range from copper to brown in color.

Think of the Queen Mary [an ocean liner]\u2014 the whole ship goes by and then comes the rudder. And there's a tiny thing at the edge of the rudder called a trim tab. It's a miniature rudder. Just moving the little trim tab builds a low pressure that pulls the rudder around. Takes almost no effort at all. So I said that the little individual can be a trim tab. Society thinks it's going right by you, that it's left you all together. But if you're doing dynamic things mentally, the fact is that you can just put your foot out like that and the whole big ship of state is going to go. So I said, call me Trim Tab.\u201d \r\n\u2013 Buckminster Fuller (Playboy, February 1972)\r\n\r\nSmall actions - Huge positive impact.

After much planning, research and construction business was begun in March of 1994. The brewery is a small 17-barrel (527 gallon) batch system and operates on the Acevedo's rural residential property.  Within seven months of opening El Toro Brewing Company received its first national recognition at the 1994 Great American Beer Festival (GABF). One of its flagships El Toro Oro Golden Ale won a coveted Gold Medal for English Pale Ale. At the 1996 GABF Poppy Jasper Amber Ale, the brewery's other flagship beer, won a Silver Medal for English Brown Ale. It is a mild yet robust brown ale. The 1997 GABF saw El Toro garner another Gold Medal for the American styled wheat beer named after the brewer's father-in-law, William Jones Wheat Beer.  After 16 years of planning, Geno and Cindy Acevedo of Morgan Hill finally opened a brewpub on November 25 2006. El Toro Brewpub is a two floored building with patio. Inside is the world's only Poppy Jasper Bar. Featuring over 45 feet of gorgeously inlaid and polished Poppy Jasper rock into its surface. To the back of the large mirrored bar you will find over 25 beers and handcrafted sodas on tap. We also have a gleaming copper Pub Brewing system 3 BBL (100 gallon) brewery. Live music and dancing will also be a regular nighttime happening at the brewpub consisting of mostly local bands playing cover type and original Rock, Blues, Jazz and Reggae.","website":"http:\/\/www.eltorobrewing.com\/","established":"1992","mailingListUrl":"info@eltorobrewing.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/yuxw75\/upload_Idq3L2-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/yuxw75\/upload_Idq3L2-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/yuxw75\/upload_Idq3L2-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/yuxw75\/upload_Idq3L2-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/yuxw75\/upload_Idq3L2-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:45:15","locations":[{"id":"4F7QA9","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"17605 Monterey Road","locality":"Morgan Hill","region":"California","postalCode":"95037","phone":"408-782-2739","website":"http:\/\/www.eltorobrewing.com\/","latitude":37.1304557,"longitude":-121.6546846,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"jLGEa3","name":"Pound Town Brown","nameDisplay":"Pound Town Brown","abv":"5.2","styleId":12,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-08 03:12:17","updateDate":"2015-03-09 15:39:09","style":{"id":12,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"English-Style Brown Ale","shortName":"English Brown","description":"English brown ales range from copper to brown in color.

The Godfathers, pleased with their honorary responsibility, thought carefully for the future of little Dugald.\r\n\r\nSeveral pints of mediocre ale later the idea for forming a brewery and making their own beer began to take hold. A toast was made and within weeks a site (wholly inadequate) was found and the equipment (too big for the site) was bought.\r\n\r\nThe first brew, Godfathers, won the Bronze Award for best ale in Britain the following year at the Great British Beer Festival.\r\n\r\n16 years, 30 million pints and a brewery relocation later IVB continues to thrive. Situated in the heart of Hampshire we produce an unrivalled range of award winning real ales with pure Hampshire water, yeast and barley along with the finest hops around the country and world.\r\n\r\nGodson Dugald is as yet too young to enjoy his beer birthright, but we\u2019re sure he will.","website":"http:\/\/www.itchenvalley.com","established":"1997","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/8lPRKA\/upload_taQGVV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/8lPRKA\/upload_taQGVV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/8lPRKA\/upload_taQGVV-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/8lPRKA\/upload_taQGVV-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/8lPRKA\/upload_taQGVV-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-04-10 22:14:12","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:53:36","locations":[{"id":"WFl75R","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Unit D Prospect Commercial Park","extendedAddress":"Prospect Road","locality":"New Alresford","region":"Hampshire","postalCode":"SO249QF","phone":"01962 735111","website":"http:\/\/www.itchenvalley.com\/","latitude":51.0823384,"longitude":-1.17217,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"GB","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-04-12 21:16:28","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"GB","name":"UNITED KINGDOM","displayName":"United Kingdom","isoThree":"GBR","numberCode":826,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
