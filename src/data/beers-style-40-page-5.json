After the aging period, the different casks are blended together in order to obtain complexity and lots of flavors. St Bon-Chien is one of the world's flagship's sour beers coming from a mixed fermentation. It first ferments with wine yeast, then during the cask's maturation, lots of microorganisms coming from the casks change  the beer's flavors' profile.\r\n\r\nThe best way to enjoy a good Bon-Chien is to serve it in a kind of wine glass or a Teku at about 16\u00b0C or 60.6\u00b0F paired with a duck breast or some panned foie gras for example. Don't hesitate to keep some bottles in your cellar and age it, I can remember a fantastic Bon-Chien 2004 that we shared with some friend after 9 years ... \r\n\r\nOh, I forgot it : Bon-Chien (Good Dog) was the first brewery's cat and she got holyfied when she died and became straight on Saint Bon-Chien.

For Jeff Lebesch would return to Fort Collins with a handful of ingredients and an imagination full of recipes. And then there was beer. Jeff's first two basement-brewed creations? A brown dubbel with earthy undertones named Abbey and a remarkably well-balanced amber he named Fat Tire. To say the rest was history would be to overlook his wife's involvement. Kim Jordan was New Belgium's first bottler, sales rep, distributor, marketer and financial planner.

It was brewed in August of 2008 with a base of 2-Row malt and 440 lbs of local raspberries in the mash. It was then conservatively hopped with Tettanang, German Tradition and Saaz and fermented with our house yeast strain. Shortly after primary fermentation, the beer was racked into eleven red wine barrels, nine of which were inoculated with either Lactobacillus or Brettanomyces \"Allagensis\". After one year, we placed an additional 100 lbs of local raspberries in five of the barrels. The beer continued to age for an additional year, at which time the barrels were blended to strike the desired balance of fruit and funk.\r\nMattina Rossa has an aroma of fresh raspberry, strawberry preserves and lemon rind. Raspberry is also discernible in the flavor, along with mild quince and pomegranate.
