Brewed with copious amounts of dark malt and fermented at low temperatures for months, or even years. Adambier is a style that has been unjustly forgotten, and it has been a pleasure to reconstruct this historical beer. Ours is a deep, tawny color that\u2019s boozy, with hints of vanilla. Gentle whisps of ripe plums and caramel meld with the deep undertones of chocolate and tobacco, with lush aromas of sherry and honey.","abv":"11","ibu":"35","glasswareId":8,"srmId":41,"availableId":2,"styleId":159,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","servingTemperature":"cellar","servingTemperatureDisplay":"Cellar - (12-14C\/54-57F)","originalGravity":"1.075","createDate":"2014-09-10 22:45:52","updateDate":"2015-02-26 21:58:30","glass":{"id":8,"name":"Tulip","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"srm":{"id":41,"name":"Over 40","hex":"000000"},"available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"style":{"id":159,"categoryId":4,"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Adambier","shortName":"Adambier","description":"Adambier is light brown to very dark in color.
