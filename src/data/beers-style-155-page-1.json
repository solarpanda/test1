Over time, as Bob became more interested in cider, we started traveling to the Pays D\u2019Auge region of Normandy, where we tasted many varieties of this traditional beverage that is typically served with meals, and is the perfect complement to the wonderful cuisine of the area.\r\nAs we experienced the cider culture of northern France, we realized that nothing like these dry, complex ciders existed in the U.S., and we became excited about the prospect of introducing a French-style cider to the American palate. Back at our orchard, we began planting cider cultivars from France, England and America, while testing the types that would work best with the Island\u2019s climate and rocky limestone soil. Our Washington Island orchard has expanded with our passion for cider, and we now produce several varieties of gluten-free cider in our Cider House in the small town of Ellison Bay, WI, located at the tip of the Door Peninsula.","website":"http:\/\/islandorchardcider.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/yy3cTm\/upload_1kRAgF-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/yy3cTm\/upload_1kRAgF-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/yy3cTm\/upload_1kRAgF-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/yy3cTm\/upload_1kRAgF-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/yy3cTm\/upload_1kRAgF-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-08-01 14:09:54","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:14:21","locations":[{"id":"l9BVLi","name":"Main Cidery","streetAddress":"12040 Garrett Bay Rd","locality":"Ellison Bay","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"54210","phone":"(920) 854-3344","website":"http:\/\/islandorchardcider.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"SPRING (5\/1\u20135\/24)\r\nFri: 2-5 pm\r\nSat: 12-5 pm\r\nSun: 12-3 pm\r\nOpen Memorial Day 5\/25:\r\n12-3 pm\r\n\r\nSUMMER (5\/29\u20139\/14)\r\nDaily: 12-6 pm\r\n\r\nFALL (9\/17\u201310\/26)\r\nThurs: 12-4 pm\r\nFri\/Sat. : 12-6 pm\r\nSun\/Mon: 12-3 pm\r\n\r\nWINTER (10\/30\u201311\/28)\r\nFri: 2-6 pm\r\nSat: 12-5 pm\r\nSun: Closed","latitude":45.2563309,"longitude":-87.0712481,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"cidery","locationTypeDisplay":"Cidery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-08-01 14:13:52","updateDate":"2015-08-01 14:13:52","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"kq5lL0","name":"Apple Ginger","nameDisplay":"Apple Ginger","description":"Our Apple Ginger cider is a unlike any other cider.

He planted twenty five varieties in a test block of two acres to study the growing patterns: did each fit into the existing bloom and harvest schedule of the farm, what were the flavor profiles of the fruit and how did that variety add to the cider that we wanted to make.\r\n\r\nFrom that original twenty five, Craig has narrowed it down to the eight most suitable for commercial production, never closing the door on annual experimentation when he learns of a new variety. We now have the largest acreage of cider apples and Perry pears in the state of Washington with 55 acres.\r\n\r\nThe Yakima Valley is the largest apple producing region in Washington and there is an infrastructure existing in our valley that provides many advantages when you are making cider.  Whether we are storing our apples in controlled atmosphere, sending our apricots and cherries to be processed, or selecting the complementary hops and pumpkin for our seasonal ciders \u2013 it all exists in the valley we call home.\r\n\r\nA love of land, food and drink has inspired us to make cider with the fruit we are growing at our ranch, Harmony Orchards.  We know the ciders we make are an expression of the harvest and reflective of the fruit and the place that it is grown.","website":"http:\/\/tietonciderworks.com\/","established":"1920","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-16 20:31:38","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:04:59","locations":[{"id":"9ASIXD","name":"Main Cidery","streetAddress":"619 West J Street","locality":"Yakima","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98902","phone":"509-571-1430","website":"http:\/\/tietonciderworks.com\/","latitude":46.6158588,"longitude":-120.5217865,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"cidery","locationTypeDisplay":"Cidery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-17 12:36:21","updateDate":"2015-02-17 12:36:21","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"QRz9pH","name":"Apricot Cider","nameDisplay":"Apricot Cider","description":"OS apricot features the natural taste and aroma of fresh apricots balanced with acidity and tartness.","abv":"5.5","ibu":"22","styleId":155,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/QRz9pH\/upload_IGHAbV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/QRz9pH\/upload_IGHAbV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/QRz9pH\/upload_IGHAbV-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"shephard's pie\r\nlamb curry","createDate":"2014-11-14 19:47:00","updateDate":"2015-12-17 18:34:34","style":{"id":155,"categoryId":12,"category":{"id":12,"name":"Mead, Cider, & Perry","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Fruit Cider","shortName":"Fruit Cider","description":"Like a dry wine with complex flavors.

In 1986, Teo decides, with his partner then Michelle, a pretty young French dancer, to open in Piozzo, a small town unknown to the door of the Langhe where he was born, a \"creperie\"! He rents a former \"tavern\" with an attached mini apartment on the top floor and a gravel courtyard on the back and opens its doors. At first, his passion for beer, and a little 'light his aversion for wine led him to fill the menu with more than two hundred references international beers, as well as dainties to enjoy to work alongside the crepes. Gradually, the goodness of the choices made \u200b\u200bgood name and port customers to small local baptized \"Le Baladin\" by his friend Fran\u00e7ois of CIRQUE BIDON in homage to the nature of Teo same. Years went by and the room expands, you change, you will see a big circus tent to cover the courtyard paved with gravel now tables and chairs in style \"Oktoberfest\" and hand in hand also changes his mentor: Nora is now its new companion and muse together and decide a new course of the local : transform the creperie in a brewpub! After months of study and travel with Nora to discover Belgian brewers have our hero returns with huge bins loaded onto a van Volkswagen Westfalia and places them in the garage of the ousted former owner of the house, adjacent to the restaurant, now transformed into a microbrewery. So begins the adventure productive BEER BALADIN that sees just two beers \"taxes\" to the regulars who frequent the pub goers somewhat perplexed and embarrassed to taste these first, honestly a bit 'adventurous productions Teo. Over time, the production will be moved to other places for sizing issues and logistics, but still the aura of magic that permeated the early days of the brewery remains unchanged. Today, large kitchen has taken the place of the production and in the pub beers are on tap now classic carnet baladiniano as well as all production in the bottle. Occasionally a few small tweaks gives customers reason of surprise and veiled \"Amarcord\" in which one of them remembers the beginnings of this place, now a destination for \"pilgrimage\" by many fans of the beer world.

The cidery originally sat in the historic Fruit Growers Exchange Association, a building that once was a storage and packing facility for the abundance of fruits grown in the area. It seemed appropriate to use this space, bringing it back towards its original use. After two years in that location, the cidery outgrew the space and moved to a much larger facility less than a mile down the road.","website":"http:\/\/www.foxbarrel.com\/","established":"2004","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/aP9faI\/upload_Qe3DXq-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/aP9faI\/upload_Qe3DXq-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/aP9faI\/upload_Qe3DXq-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/aP9faI\/upload_Qe3DXq-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/aP9faI\/upload_Qe3DXq-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-18 00:07:40","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:52:53","locations":[{"id":"uRHoZ3","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1213 S.

Jason Hendricks and Jason Schlaff met in the fall of  2009.  They didn\u2019t know then that their friendship would bloom, but when it did, a brewery would be the flower.\r\n\r\nThe Jasons started humbly with a five gallon pot, a homebrew starter kit, and an idea of what good should be.  The first brew was just ok, an American Ale extract kit that did not allow for any artistry.  They quickly realized they needed to switch things up in order to attain the flavors they wanted.  So, the two amateurs ventured into the world of all-grain brewing.  The first mash tun, a cooler, the first brew, a porter.  Jason and Jason had their first failure.  \r\n\r\nPoor taste and terrible color ruined their tongues but not their spirit.  They could do much much better.   Schlaff, an avid reader and researcher, dove head first into every book he could find.  Hendricks scoured the internet and talked to every expert he could find.  Armed with brains full of knowledge the two gents embarked on the brewing adventure again.  \r\n\r\nThe second beer, a blonde ale, crafted with the newfound comprehension they acquired.  After a two weeks of eager anticipation, success!  The Jasons now had the knowledge, the drive, and the skill.  Each ale after that was instant hit among their friends and family.  Gary Schlaff, Jason\u2019s distinguished father, joined the endeavor in 2013.  Gary, a marketing genius, is nearing retirement and has decided to throw his business knowledge into the mix.\r\n\r\nThe brewery itself will not serve or prepare food.  Patrons will be allowed to bring in outside food, as well as have food delivered to them at the brewery.\r\n\r\nWe strive to be as sustainable and as local as possible.  The brewhouse and fermenters will be purchased for Psycho Brew LLC of Greenville, MI.  Our hops will be purchased from the many growers in Michigan.  Our spent grain will be sold to local farmers instead of going to waste in a landfill.  As a side project, we will also used the spent grain to made organic dog treats.","website":"http:\/\/fbcbrewing.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ohbgYE\/upload_WwIcxm-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ohbgYE\/upload_WwIcxm-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ohbgYE\/upload_WwIcxm-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ohbgYE\/upload_WwIcxm-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ohbgYE\/upload_WwIcxm-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-11-24 00:48:05","updateDate":"2016-04-10 21:15:30","locations":[{"id":"fSqavF","name":"Farmington Brewing Company","streetAddress":"33336 Grand River","locality":"Farmington","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"48336","phone":"(248) 957-9543","website":"http:\/\/fbcbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Wed:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\nThu:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\nFri:  4:00pm - 11:00pm\nSat:  2:00pm - 11:00pm\nSun:  2:00pm - 9:00pm\n\n","latitude":42.464946,"longitude":-83.375958,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2014","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-11-24 00:51:59","updateDate":"2016-04-10 21:15:14","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"AN3ELo","name":"Blueberry Cider","nameDisplay":"Blueberry Cider","abv":"6.9","styleId":155,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-07-06 14:30:48","updateDate":"2016-07-06 14:30:48","style":{"id":155,"categoryId":12,"category":{"id":12,"name":"Mead, Cider, & Perry","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Fruit Cider","shortName":"Fruit Cider","description":"Like a dry wine with complex flavors.
