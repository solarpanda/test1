It was a Westvleteren 12, a beer brewed by Belgian Monks. I had no idea that beer could have such complex flavors. The experience instantly changed my life and set me off on an adventure around the world in pursuit of deeper insight into global brewing cultures and techniques.\r\n\r\nIn 2010 and 2011, I worked with breweries in England, Japan and Denmark, picked hops in West Kent, and befriended brewers from around the globe. The experiences and trade secrets I picked up inspired me to start a brewery where I could bring new and innovative beers back home to the U.S. Together with my partners Brian Berge, Kevin Hilliard, and Eric Schmidt, we\u2019ve made that dream come true with Insight Brewing Company.","website":"http:\/\/www.insightbrewing.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/h5zbGr\/upload_43XhSq-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/h5zbGr\/upload_43XhSq-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/h5zbGr\/upload_43XhSq-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/h5zbGr\/upload_43XhSq-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/h5zbGr\/upload_43XhSq-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-01-19 21:35:12","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:04:03","locations":[{"id":"elfZCu","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2821 East Hennepin Avenue","locality":"Minneapolis","region":"Minnesota","postalCode":"55413","phone":"(612) 722-7222","latitude":44.991933,"longitude":-93.21295,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-01-19 21:36:04","updateDate":"2015-06-03 17:16:12","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"TI53eD","name":"Z.P.A.

Nick and Simon brewed intense balanced beers that were and still remain \u201cnot normal\u201d by conventional standards.\r\n\r\nIn November of 2005, after receiving numerous visitors to the brewery over the years, Three Floyds opened its own brewpub at the production facility. What was once office space is now a refuge for the craft beer enthusiast. With all the Three Floyds mainstays, seasonal offerings, special small batch beers and many guest beers it is a mecca for craft beer. The pub also has a full service kitchen providing pub fare of the best quality supported by a 3000 square foot organic herb and vegetable garden.","website":"http:\/\/www.3floyds.com","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/iodDki\/upload_Va4zor-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/iodDki\/upload_Va4zor-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/iodDki\/upload_Va4zor-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/iodDki\/upload_Va4zor-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/iodDki\/upload_Va4zor-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2016-01-15 16:17:52","locations":[{"id":"71LkGn","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"9750 Indiana Parkway","locality":"Munster","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"46321","phone":"1-219-922-3565","website":"http:\/\/www.threefloydspub.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nTue:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nWed:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nThu:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nFri:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nSat:  12:00pm - 2:00am\r\nSun:  12:00pm - 12:00am","latitude":41.535541,"longitude":-87.516686,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2015-06-18 14:42:36","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"GoDmMT","name":"Munster","streetAddress":"9750 Indiana Parkway","locality":"Munster","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"46321","phone":"219-922-4425","website":"http:\/\/www.3floyds.com\/","latitude":41.535536,"longitude":-87.516687,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:16","updateDate":"2015-04-01 18:55:51","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"OLUVAq","name":"Zombie Lust","nameDisplay":"Zombie Lust","abv":"6.2","styleId":25,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/OLUVAq\/upload_L6v51t-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/OLUVAq\/upload_L6v51t-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/OLUVAq\/upload_L6v51t-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-13 15:23:04","updateDate":"2015-12-17 22:19:49","style":{"id":25,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"American Pale","description":"American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.
