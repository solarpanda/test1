Bayliner Weisse is our take on the traditional German Berliner Weisse style. Over 700 breweries in Germany used to make this beer and by the 19th century it was their most popular style of beer. By the late 20th century only two breweries in Berlin still produce these beers. This particular style is an unfiltered, sour wheat beer that comes in at about 3.6% alc\/vol. It is a nice sessionable beer that can be enjoyed anytime of the year. Traditionally served with woodruff or raspberry syrup but it is most enjoyable when served on it's own.","abv":"3.6","ibu":"4","glasswareId":9,"availableId":2,"styleId":48,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/5vM6sS\/upload_jfgOZ9-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/5vM6sS\/upload_jfgOZ9-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/5vM6sS\/upload_jfgOZ9-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"Cheese plate with fresh goat\u2019s milk cheese, brie and light cheddar","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:47","updateDate":"2015-12-16 09:31:24","glass":{"id":9,"name":"Weizen","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"style":{"id":48,"categoryId":4,"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"South German-Style Hefeweizen \/ Hefeweissbier","shortName":"Hefeweizen","description":"The aroma and flavor of a Weissbier with yeast is decidedly fruity and phenolic.

Let\u2019s start a craft beer brewery!\u201d  That Clarity in Thinking, led to the successful launch of Lucid Brewing.\r\n\r\nIn June of 2011, with a year of planning already completed, they realized jumping headfirst into the brewery was the only way they could make their dream a reality.  They quit their day jobs.  \r\n\r\nWith that leap of faith \u2013 and a ton of support from many friends and family \u2013 they started building their brewery from the ground up.  Through the sweltering heat of the 2011 summer, many friends labored side by side with Jon and Eric.  They did it all, start to finish, from digging trenches to assembling the last tank.  So of course they needed a refreshing and light drink to quench their thirst while they toiled away.  They found just the right recipe and brewed their first beer \u2013 AIR.  A beer made to get the job done.  Its slight citrus aroma and flavor, lower ABV and crisp dry finish made this their favorite \u201cgo to\u201d beer.  \r\n\r\nBy October the brewery was complete and cooking.  And in the spirit of the season, Eric and Jon gave thanks to the Brew gods when they made their first deliveries to their first three customers the week of Thanksgiving\u2026 in Jon\u2019s car.  Lucid was on its way!\r\n\r\nAlways keeping an eye on the demand for high quality while quickly catching the craft beer lover\u2019s attention, Lucid assembled a team of dedicated employees and introduced brews to quench their customers\u2019 demands.   AIR, DYNO, FOTO and DUO, along with seasonal and small-batch brews, are quickly becoming Minnesota favorites at local bars and restaurants.  \r\n\r\nGreat success has followed them after throwing away the daily grind for the daily brew.","website":"http:\/\/www.lucidbrewing.com\/","established":"2011","mailingListUrl":"www.LucidBrewing.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0cACKo\/upload_KCE6lg-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0cACKo\/upload_KCE6lg-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0cACKo\/upload_KCE6lg-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0cACKo\/upload_KCE6lg-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0cACKo\/upload_KCE6lg-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:01","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:22:32","locations":[{"id":"1xeovq","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"6020 Culligan Way","locality":"Minnetonka","region":"Minnesota","postalCode":"55345","phone":"612-810-9324","website":"http:\/\/lucidbrewing.wordpress.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Thu - Fri: 5:00 pm - 8:00 pm\r\nSat: 12:00 pm - 5:00 pm","latitude":44.895218,"longitude":-93.449725,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2009","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:01","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"cH5cqq","name":"Bi\u00e8re Blanche","nameDisplay":"Bi\u00e8re Blanche","abv":"4.5","glasswareId":9,"availableId":1,"styleId":48,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:48","updateDate":"2012-03-22 13:05:10","glass":{"id":9,"name":"Weizen","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":48,"categoryId":4,"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"South German-Style Hefeweizen \/ Hefeweissbier","shortName":"Hefeweizen","description":"The aroma and flavor of a Weissbier with yeast is decidedly fruity and phenolic.

For 24 years, Peter has brewed award-winning beer, winning contests, teaching others and perfecting classic recipes along the way.

Ayinger beers have been frequent award winners in international beer competitions.\r\n\r\nFor some years, a range of beer was brewed under the Ayingerbrau name by Samuel Smith's Brewery in Tadcaster, United Kingdom. Although the Ayinger logo was used, the recipes and range were different from those of the Ayinger Brewery. The arrangement ended in spring 2006, at which point Samuel Smith's rebranded the beers. Distribution of the Ayinger range of beer followed that summer. Because the Oktoberfest in Munich does not allow breweries outside its city limits to participate, Ayinger Brewery organizes many smaller festivals in the countryside around Munich.","website":"http:\/\/en.ayinger-bier.de\/","established":"1878","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QKdFk2\/upload_jjUvnX-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QKdFk2\/upload_jjUvnX-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QKdFk2\/upload_jjUvnX-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QKdFk2\/upload_jjUvnX-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QKdFk2\/upload_jjUvnX-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-28 16:51:35","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:36:51","locations":[{"id":"eqCbpj","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"M\u00fcnchner Stra\u00dfe 21","region":"Aying","postalCode":"D-85653","phone":"49080958890","isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-10-07 20:47:32","updateDate":"2014-10-07 20:47:32","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"NpJzPb","name":"Br\u00e4uchle Hefe-Weizen","nameDisplay":"Br\u00e4uchle Hefe-Weizen","styleId":48,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-12 12:01:06","updateDate":"2015-05-14 18:01:55","style":{"id":48,"categoryId":4,"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"South German-Style Hefeweizen \/ Hefeweissbier","shortName":"Hefeweizen","description":"The aroma and flavor of a Weissbier with yeast is decidedly fruity and phenolic.

Thanks to Edward \"Skip\" Daugherty, owner\/operator of St. Francois Winery, the dream of not just bringing local, handcrafted wines to the public, but local, handcrafted beer as well is a reality.\r\n\r\nToday, the Deslogetown Brewery seeks to provide approachable craft brews without all the fuss - instead we hope to expand your beer palate with a beer that you will find delicious and refreshing.\r\n\r\n\u200bOpen FRIDAY 4pm-7pm\r\nSATURDAY 1pm-7pm\r\nSUNDAY 1pm-5pm\r\n1669 Pine Ridge Trail, off Highway 32, between Park Hills and Bismarck","website":"http:\/\/www.deslogetown.com","established":"2015","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ajfUAW\/upload_vpUB32-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ajfUAW\/upload_vpUB32-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ajfUAW\/upload_vpUB32-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ajfUAW\/upload_vpUB32-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ajfUAW\/upload_vpUB32-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-05-05 00:53:37","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:08:27","locations":[{"id":"zEWBBt","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1669 Pine Ridge Trail","locality":"Park Hills","region":"Missouri","postalCode":"63601","phone":"1.5734314294","website":"www.deslogetown.com","latitude":37.832294,"longitude":-90.563307,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2015","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-05-05 15:51:33","updateDate":"2015-05-12 17:10:46","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Gryvdh","name":"Bullfrog Ale","nameDisplay":"Bullfrog Ale","styleId":48,"isOrganic":"Y","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-05-15 17:32:27","updateDate":"2015-05-15 17:32:27","style":{"id":48,"categoryId":4,"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"South German-Style Hefeweizen \/ Hefeweissbier","shortName":"Hefeweizen","description":"The aroma and flavor of a Weissbier with yeast is decidedly fruity and phenolic.
