With over 85 breweries in San Diego in January of 2013, we knew that we wanted to add our own unique contribution to the beer scene. Having been raised on both sides of the border, we always enjoyed eating from both cultures.  Mexican Street Tacos, chile enfused candies, enchiladas one day, and Hamburgers, mac and cheese and ding dongs the next. As adults we realized how unique being raised on the border was, how the mix of flavors was seeping from north to south, and south to north. It was this fusion in flavors that inspired to take traditional, European brewing traditions and infuse the process with a whole new palette of Latin American ingredients.  So we dug into our own roots for inspiration and found a treasure trove of brewing traditions, ingredients and unique flavors.  Our best example of this is our Blood Saison, an agave and Hibiscus infused Saison that come off sweet initially, middle tartness and finishing like a beer.","website":"http:\/\/www.borderxbrewing.com\/","established":"2013","mailingListUrl":"info@borderxbrewing.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/dx6426\/upload_OyXAX9-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/dx6426\/upload_OyXAX9-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/dx6426\/upload_OyXAX9-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/dx6426\/upload_OyXAX9-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/dx6426\/upload_OyXAX9-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-16 00:07:12","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:04:57","locations":[{"id":"IDHs4u","name":"Logan Tasting Room","streetAddress":"2181 Logan Ave","locality":"San Diego","region":"California","postalCode":"92113","phone":"6194310771","website":"http:\/\/www.borderxbrewing.com","hoursOfOperation":"Wed:  2:00pm - 8:00pm\r\nThu:  2:00pm - 8:00pm\r\nFri:  2:00pm - 11:00pm\r\nSat:  2:00pm - 11:00pm\r\nSun:  2:00pm - 6:00pm","latitude":32.6981297,"longitude":-117.1397481,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"restaurant","locationTypeDisplay":"Restaurant\/Ale House","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-16 00:07:12","updateDate":"2015-11-18 21:16:23","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"cRLX8x","name":"Otay Brewery","streetAddress":"8684 Avenida De La Fuente Ste 8","locality":"San Diego","region":"California","postalCode":"92154","phone":"6194310771","website":"http:\/\/www.borderxbrewing.com\/","latitude":32.5566393,"longitude":-116.9567988,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-18 16:21:01","updateDate":"2015-06-15 19:18:10","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"E2PNwh","name":"Leon","nameDisplay":"Leon","description":"Tired of talking my friends into pit stops at beer bars before heading \u201cout\u201d \u2014 in fear of having to drink bland lager all night \u2014 I set out to craft an ale that would act as companion throughout the evening.

Along the way, we\u2019ve made lots of friends and drank our unfair share of good beer, all while trying to do good in our communities and do well as a craft brewery.","website":"http:\/\/uplandbeer.com\/","established":"1998","mailingListUrl":"info@uplandbeer.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Tfw5on\/upload_cDEmR3-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Tfw5on\/upload_cDEmR3-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Tfw5on\/upload_cDEmR3-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Tfw5on\/upload_cDEmR3-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Tfw5on\/upload_cDEmR3-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:01:41","locations":[{"id":"esM0Nc","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"350 West 11th Street","locality":"Bloomington","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"47404","phone":"812-336-2337","website":"http:\/\/uplandbeer.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Upland offers free tours from 3-5 pm every Saturday and Sunday.\r\n\r\nBrewpub:\r\npen 11:00am until midnight Monday through Thursday\r\nOpen 11:00am until 1:00am Friday and Saturday\r\nOpen noon until midnight Sunday","latitude":39.1732971,"longitude":-86.5368625,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1998","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"E3tJa3","name":"Westside Beer Bar","streetAddress":"4060 Profile Pkwy","locality":"Bloomington","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"47404","phone":"812.336.2337","hoursOfOperation":"Wed:  3:00pm - 10:00pm\nThu:  3:00pm - 10:00pm\nFri:  3:00pm - 10:00pm\nSat:  2:00pm - 10:00pm\nSun:  2:00pm - 10:00pm\n\n","latitude":39.172339,"longitude":-86.586343,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-31 16:07:27","updateDate":"2015-03-31 16:07:27","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"qNc7jU","name":"Carmel Tap House","streetAddress":"820 E. 116th St.","locality":"Carmel","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"46032","phone":"1.317.564.3400","website":"http:\/\/uplandbeer.com\/locations\/carmel-tap-house\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  11:00am - 12:00am\nTue:  11:00am - 12:00am\nWed:  11:00am - 12:00am\nThu:  11:00am - 12:00am\nFri:  11:00am - 1:00am\nSat:  11:00am - 1:00am\nSun:  12:00pm - 12:00am\n\n","latitude":39.9568182,"longitude":-86.1431514,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-31 16:10:54","updateDate":"2016-03-01 19:30:44","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"ShKvsv","name":"Broad Ripple","streetAddress":"4842 North College Ave.","locality":"Indianapolis","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"46205","phone":"1.317.602.3931","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\r\nTue:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\r\nWed:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\r\nThu:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\r\nFri:  12:00pm - 12:00am\r\nSat:  12:00pm - 12:00am\r\nSun:  4:00pm - 10:00pm","latitude":39.8426549,"longitude":-86.1458764,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-31 16:13:26","updateDate":"2015-07-06 16:59:54","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"0GgoFA","name":"Lips of Faith - Le Fleur Misseur","nameDisplay":"Lips of Faith - Le Fleur Misseur","description":"Deep burnished gold with a slight haze, Le Fleur Misseur opens with pineapple, clove and honey notes.

The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand.

After returning to the states, they had trouble finding that type of beer in Chicago so they opened Two Brothers Brewing Company in 1996. To get them started, the brothers' grandfather, a retired dairy farmer, donated his bulk milk tanks, which were quickly converted to fermenters. Currently, the brewery resides in a 40,000 square foot facility 30 miles west of Chicago. In addition to their traditional style beers, Two Brothers Brewing Company produces many specialty beers including the Project Opus Sour series. Adjacent to the brewery, Two Brothers Tap House opened in 2008 as a restaurant which serves elevated, seasonal, and organic American pub fare. In 2011, the Ebel brothers purchased Walter Payton's Roundhouse located in Aurora, IL. The Two Brothers Roundhouse is a full service brewpub restaurant, music venue, offers banquet space for large parties and weddings and hosts the Two Brothers Cafe and Beer Bar! \r\n\r\nTwo Brothers Brewing Company's award winning products are currently available in Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Florida, New York, Iowa and Missouri.","website":"http:\/\/www.TwoBrothersBrewing.com\/","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Cu5xXG\/upload_FFc22Y-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Cu5xXG\/upload_FFc22Y-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Cu5xXG\/upload_FFc22Y-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Cu5xXG\/upload_FFc22Y-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Cu5xXG\/upload_FFc22Y-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:01:21","locations":[{"id":"jeOXxz","name":"Two Brothers Tap House","streetAddress":"30 w 315 Calumet Ave.","locality":"Warrenville","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60555","phone":"630.393.2337","website":"http:\/\/www.twobrotherstaphouse.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday        3:00 - 11:00\r\nTuesday        3:00 - 11:00\r\nWednesday   3:00 - 11:00\r\nThursday      3:00 - 11:00\r\nFriday         12:00 - 12:00\r\nSaturday     12:00 - 12:00\r\nSunday        12:00 - 9:00","latitude":41.824453,"longitude":-88.212512,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2015-07-14 13:53:02","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"YOdPoo","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"30W315 Calumet Ave.","locality":"Warrenville","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60555","website":"http:\/\/www.twobrosbrew.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"We are give tours EVERY Saturday at 1:00 and 2:30 and Sunday at 1:00.","latitude":41.824906,"longitude":-88.211221,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2012-01-26 12:57:18","updateDate":"2015-07-07 21:22:36","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"AiMDyF","name":"Two Brothers Roundhouse","streetAddress":"205 N.

There would be much to say and tell it to start back over the key dates. In 1986, Teo decides, with his partner then Michelle, a pretty young French dancer, to open in Piozzo, a small town unknown to the door of the Langhe where he was born, a \"creperie\"! He rents a former \"tavern\" with an attached mini apartment on the top floor and a gravel courtyard on the back and opens its doors. At first, his passion for beer, and a little 'light his aversion for wine led him to fill the menu with more than two hundred references international beers, as well as dainties to enjoy to work alongside the crepes. Gradually, the goodness of the choices made \u200b\u200bgood name and port customers to small local baptized \"Le Baladin\" by his friend Fran\u00e7ois of CIRQUE BIDON in homage to the nature of Teo same. Years went by and the room expands, you change, you will see a big circus tent to cover the courtyard paved with gravel now tables and chairs in style \"Oktoberfest\" and hand in hand also changes his mentor: Nora is now its new companion and muse together and decide a new course of the local : transform the creperie in a brewpub! After months of study and travel with Nora to discover Belgian brewers have our hero returns with huge bins loaded onto a van Volkswagen Westfalia and places them in the garage of the ousted former owner of the house, adjacent to the restaurant, now transformed into a microbrewery. So begins the adventure productive BEER BALADIN that sees just two beers \"taxes\" to the regulars who frequent the pub goers somewhat perplexed and embarrassed to taste these first, honestly a bit 'adventurous productions Teo. Over time, the production will be moved to other places for sizing issues and logistics, but still the aura of magic that permeated the early days of the brewery remains unchanged. Today, large kitchen has taken the place of the production and in the pub beers are on tap now classic carnet baladiniano as well as all production in the bottle. Occasionally a few small tweaks gives customers reason of surprise and veiled \"Amarcord\" in which one of them remembers the beginnings of this place, now a destination for \"pilgrimage\" by many fans of the beer world. It is always a place where good food is accompanied not only by our beers but by good music and by the sympathy of the staff who always has a smile for everyone and where it is customary to a friendly \"welcome\", a hello and a good day to all those who pass through it if only for a small beer refreshing.","website":"http:\/\/www.baladin.it\/","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/6iVXTk\/upload_VmI4R2-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/6iVXTk\/upload_VmI4R2-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/6iVXTk\/upload_VmI4R2-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/6iVXTk\/upload_VmI4R2-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/6iVXTk\/upload_VmI4R2-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:46","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:39:56","locations":[{"id":"1kXTo5","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Piazza V Luglio, 15","locality":"Piozzo","phone":"39-0173-795431","latitude":44.5154291,"longitude":7.8921316,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"IT","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:46","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"IT","name":"ITALY","displayName":"Italy","isoThree":"ITA","numberCode":380,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"6pMN7f","name":"L\u2019Anvers","nameDisplay":"L\u2019Anvers","abv":"5.5","ibu":"45","styleId":62,"isOrganic":"Y","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-07-29 00:10:05","updateDate":"2015-07-29 00:10:05","style":{"id":62,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"Belgian Pale","description":"Belgian-style pale ales are characterized by low but noticeable hop bitterness, flavor, and aroma.

We think we\u2019ve met that goal, & hope you\u2019ll agree.\r\n\r\nAt Aftershock, we believe there are two different approaches to brewing.  The most common approach used by the major breweries is a \u2018scientific one\u2019.  All stages of the brewing process are closely monitored to ensure a consistent, if tasteless product.  Computers and other high tech equipment are more in control than the brewer himself.  With this approach you get \u2018scientific\u2019 beer.  The other approach is a more artistic one, while still respecting basic laws of science, and the need for spotless cleanliness.  That\u2019s the approach we plan to always take at Aftershock.  At the risk of losing an undetectable amount of consistency, the result is beer with much more character, subtle nuances, and awesome flavor.

The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery. Goose Island beers are now enjoyed in all 50 states and Europe.","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:46:51","locations":[{"id":"S2n5TB","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1800 West Fulton Street","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60612","phone":"1-800-466-7363","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","latitude":41.887107,"longitude":-87.6720969,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:33:51","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"D2gG2C","name":"Clybourn","streetAddress":"1800 North Clybourn Avenue","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60614","phone":"800-466-7363","latitude":41.9137242,"longitude":-87.65373,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1988","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:32:55","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"mcyJqn","name":"McGillycuddy","nameDisplay":"McGillycuddy","abv":"6.2","styleId":62,"isOrganic":"Y","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-07-14 01:55:20","updateDate":"2015-07-14 01:55:20","style":{"id":62,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"Belgian Pale","description":"Belgian-style pale ales are characterized by low but noticeable hop bitterness, flavor, and aroma.

The brewery addition was added back in 1994 but operated quietly as Oregon\u2019s smallest micobrewery for many years. With the more recent additions of David Vohden and Cameron Moore, we have refocused our efforts on producing and sharing a constantly changing lineup of fresh quality beers from right here in the Great Pacific Northwest. Vohden oversees all brewery operations which he has met with great success. Most recently of which was a Silver Medal for our Woozy Weizenbock at the Great American Beer Festival. We see our recent efforts bringing exciting results.\r\n\r\nWe reached completion of a 3,500 sq ft. addition to expand our brew house in the Summer of 2013. Vohden and Moore finished installation of the glycol system just in time to quench the thirsty demands of the 2013 Oregon Brewers Festival with a crowd pleasing Traverse Cherry Wit Bier. In addition to the brew house expansion we have added four 7-barrel fermentation tanks for an eventual all around 7-barrel system upgrade. A Cellar was also added for barrel aging, sours, and other delectable experiments.\r\n\r\nAlthough most of the square footage was utilized for brewing purposes. We were sure to save some space for all you beer drinkers. A mezzanine gives an elevated view down onto the open brewery floor. If you happen to drop by on a brew day you too can enjoy the sweet sensory overload and watch the action (or lack thereof). A beautiful black walnut bar, fully stocked with 13 drafts faucets was added to accompany the additional seating area and to cater to private events. However, the new bar and brewery seating are always open to patrons except in the case of private events. Another 60\u2032 TV was added to the new mezzanine area and we continue to play all major sporting events.
