They purchased a small pub called the Freemasons Hotel in Fremantle, Western Australia, installed a brewery and reopened as the Sail & Anchor Hotel. The brewery at the pub enabled the guys to control the quality and presentation of the beers and talk directly to the growing legions of converts.\r\n\r\n \r\nSoon after this the rapidly expanding outfit acquired a property in Nedlands and opened as the Matilda Bay Brewery, producing its main brands Redback & Dogbolter as well as a raft of other specialty craft beers. At the same time the group had an expanding portfolio of hotels including the \u2018Port Melbourne Brewing Co\u2019 operating as the Redback Hotel in Flemington Road, North Melbourne.\r\n \r\nIn 1988 the Brewery again moved to bigger premises, an old renovated Ford factory in Stirling Highway, North Fremantle to continue to cater to the growing demand for Matilda Bay beers. In the early 90s Matilda Bay Brewing Company became a part of the CUB family \u2013 an arrangement that would see the beers reach truly national distribution.\r\n \r\nIn 2007 we relocated to the vibrant craft beer scene in Victoria, and continued brewing first in Dandenong and most recently at an old renovated Cadbury\u2019s chocolate factory in Bertie St Port Melbourne, which includes a bar & restaurant \u2013 so we can again talk directly to our beer lovers.\r\n \r\nThroughout the years we\u2019ve produced some of Australia\u2019s favourite specialty beers & ciders, and along the way bagged a swag of trophies and awards. Our highly regarded Head Brewer \u2013 Scott Vincent \u2013 leads our brewing team with pride as they continue on the mission established in 1984 at the Sail & Anchor Hotel.","website":"http:\/\/www.matildabay.com.au\/","established":"1984","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/3cTR4d\/upload_lt46ZD-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/3cTR4d\/upload_lt46ZD-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/3cTR4d\/upload_lt46ZD-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/3cTR4d\/upload_lt46ZD-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/3cTR4d\/upload_lt46ZD-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:01","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:51:47","locations":[{"id":"NorULV","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"89 Bertie Street,","locality":"Port Melbourne","region":"VIC","postalCode":"3207","phone":"(03) 9673 4545","website":"http:\/\/www.matildabay.com.au\/","hoursOfOperation":"Bar\r\nTues \u2013 Thurs: 11am \u2013 10pm\r\nFri \u2013 Sat: 11am \u2013 11pm\r\nKitchen\r\nTues \u2013 Thurs: 12pm \u2013 3pm \/\r\n5pm \u2013 9pm\r\nFri \u2013 Sat: 12pm \u2013 10pm \r\nSun \u2013 Mon : Closed","latitude":-37.8286099,"longitude":144.9371032,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"AU","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:01","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"AU","name":"AUSTRALIA","displayName":"Australia","isoThree":"AUS","numberCode":36,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"1J37SG","name":"Begyle Christmas Ale","nameDisplay":"Begyle Christmas Ale","abv":"7","styleId":124,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-04-06 19:48:24","updateDate":"2015-04-06 19:48:24","style":{"id":124,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Herb and Spice Beer","shortName":"Spice Beer","description":"Herb beers use herbs or spices (derived from roots, seeds, fruits, vegetable, flowers, etc.) other than or in addition to hops to create a distinct (ranging from subtle to intense) character, though individual characters of herbs and\/or spices used may not always be identifiable.

No other brewery in the country brews under such history. With additional holding tanks and a bottling line located directly across the street at 28 Broadway, MBBCo's process requires great attention to detail and is very labor intensive. This delicate care sets our final product apart from other mass-produced brewing competitors.\r\n\r\nThroughout the year we have 7 beers on tap at the Maumee Bay Brew Pub, including the historical Buckeye Beer. Additionally, our beers are available at all of the restaurants in the historic Oliver House. Come enjoy our craft beer paired with Toledo's best steak at Rockwell's or enjoy a pint with a pizza baked in our wood oven at the Pub. Enjoy a brewer's sample and some classic gaming at Mutz. It's simply a great place to be - in a whole lot of old and new ways! Our beer is also available for sale in half-gallon growlers \"to go.\" We have twelve packs and kegs of Buckeye Beer available, plus kegs of select craft beers like Oktoberfest and Blitzen Ale seasonally.","website":"http:\/\/www.oh-maumeebaybrewingco.com\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/IFv3NV\/upload_kyMve2-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/IFv3NV\/upload_kyMve2-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/IFv3NV\/upload_kyMve2-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/IFv3NV\/upload_kyMve2-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/IFv3NV\/upload_kyMve2-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:01","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:51:50","locations":[{"id":"cSJ6eN","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"27 Broadway","locality":"Toledo","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"43602","phone":"419-243-1302","website":"http:\/\/www.oh-maumeebaybrewingco.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday \u2013 Thursday 3p.m. - 10p.m.\r\nFriday and Saturdays 3p.m.- 11p.m.","latitude":41.6432338,"longitude":-83.5384216,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:01","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"EMDAFA","name":"Blizzard of '78","nameDisplay":"Blizzard of '78","abv":"6","availableId":4,"styleId":124,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/EMDAFA\/upload_LWe5MW-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/EMDAFA\/upload_LWe5MW-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/EMDAFA\/upload_LWe5MW-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-04-10 16:55:22","updateDate":"2015-12-18 01:35:54","available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":124,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Herb and Spice Beer","shortName":"Spice Beer","description":"Herb beers use herbs or spices (derived from roots, seeds, fruits, vegetable, flowers, etc.) other than or in addition to hops to create a distinct (ranging from subtle to intense) character, though individual characters of herbs and\/or spices used may not always be identifiable.

We've worked hard and are incredibly proud of the many successes we've enjoyed over the years. The Boston Beer Company has been cited as one of the best companies to work for by Boston Magazine, one of the Best Entry-Level Jobs by The Princeton Review, and our beers have won more awards than any other in history. Jim has been named an \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" by Inc. Magazine. Our brewers keep amazing us with innovative new brews, including Samuel Adams Utopias and our Samuel Adams Barrel Room Collection.\r\n\r\nJim has believed from the beginning that the more you know and understand about beer, the more you'll appreciate a beer like Samuel Adams Boston Lager. To begin that mission, all new employees go through intensive training on everything from ingredients, brewing, and beer styles, to taking care of the beer once it leaves the brewery. We're all beer lovers and protectors of the beer so we're trained how to identify off flavors and how to troubleshoot the causes. The passion for beer continues with an annual homebrew competition that we all take part in.\r\n\r\nOne of our wholesalers once asked Jim why he invested so much in training his people, when ultimately they might leave. Jim smiled and replied without hesitation: \"What if I didn't train them, and they stayed?\"\r\n\r\nEach year, usually in January, everyone gathers together. One of the highlights of the meeting is the beer trivia contest. With a culture so steeped in beer education and knowledge, winning is a pretty big deal. Recently, one of the hotel bartenders who was watching as the various teams arrived in costume with music and much enthusiasm and fanfare, said, \"I've always known Samuel Adams made the best beer in America, but now I see this is the greatest company in America.\" When you look around you see that The Boston Beer Company is a team of enthusiastic people who are passionate about beer and who really love coming to work every day to provide American drinkers with the best beer possible.\r\n\r\nThe Boston Beer Company, Inc. is a publicly-traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol, SAM.","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","established":"1984","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:24:45","locations":[{"id":"DF5YsC","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"30 Germania Street","locality":"Boston","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"02130","phone":"1-800-372-1131","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","latitude":42.314449,"longitude":-71.103365,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1984","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2015-12-02 19:22:03","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"MLUbXI","name":"Cincinnati","streetAddress":"1625 Central Parkway","locality":"Cincinnati","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45214","phone":"513-412-3200","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","latitude":39.1144986,"longitude":-84.5222061,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-12 13:10:57","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"XZ6L8a","name":"Production Brewery","streetAddress":"7880 Penn Drive","locality":"Breinigsville","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"18031","latitude":40.5759622,"longitude":-75.6290377,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2007","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-11-30 20:24:56","updateDate":"2015-12-02 19:22:03","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"rYmyyZ","name":"Bush Fire - Wild Oats","nameDisplay":"Bush Fire - Wild Oats","description":"Rooibos - honeybush beer","abv":"5.8","styleId":124,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/rYmyyZ\/upload_exWlgN-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/rYmyyZ\/upload_exWlgN-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/rYmyyZ\/upload_exWlgN-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-09-08 02:54:46","updateDate":"2015-12-18 05:47:54","style":{"id":124,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Herb and Spice Beer","shortName":"Spice Beer","description":"Herb beers use herbs or spices (derived from roots, seeds, fruits, vegetable, flowers, etc.) other than or in addition to hops to create a distinct (ranging from subtle to intense) character, though individual characters of herbs and\/or spices used may not always be identifiable.
