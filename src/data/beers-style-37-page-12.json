While these kits satisfy most home-brewers (the normal ones), The Firth Brothers quickly decided they just weren\u2019t making enough beer. They had mouths to feed \u2014 their family\u2019s, friend\u2019s, friends of friend\u2019s, friends of friends of friend\u2019s, the occasional enemy\u2019s, and their own \u2014 and so they had to go bigger. The Brothers saw no other option. Thousands of dollars later, their garage became a brewing frontier. They spent years crafting different styles of beers and used their guests as test dummies (no one minded). The Firth garage was a true underground experience \u2014 kegs stacked on kegs lined the walls, racks of replacement parts crowded the entryway, the smell of oil and somehow sawdust latched to everyone\u2019s clothing, and a single torn couch was the only available seating. The guests never minded, though: the beer was always great. And the Brothers never seemed to mind when the get-togethers dragged into the early morning. Attracting lively, somewhat unruly people is what they had set out to do, but the walls of the garage seemed to be getting smaller each day.\r\n\r\nEventually, the Brothers asked the question: why don\u2019t we open up a brewery? The reality of the idea, however, was riddled with frustrating technicalities, mostly concerning money and legal regulations. Their discussions of opening a brewery often trialed off into how to overthrow the government or rob banks. Once the dust of annoying logistics had finally settled (legally), the Brothers started shopping for buildings. They eventually agreed to pack their wagons and settle their equipment in 2545 Progress St.\r\n\r\nWhat was once a huge empty room has become a rustic, good-ole\u2019-days oasis that happens to make beer. Miss-matching, reclaimed wood lines the walk-in cooler and patio fence. Vintage hanging bulbs replaced the harsh florescent lighting. The bar is hand-crafted from wood, concrete, and iron. Even the bathrooms have style: they\u2019re converted into what look like out-houses (don\u2019t worry: the pluming still works). Booze Brothers Brewing Co. asks people to forget they are in the industrial area of Vista, and even more, that we are in living in the 2000s. Most important is that Booze Brothers Brewing Co. maintains the spirit of the original concept of the Firth garage \u2014 an underground (albeit legitimate) place for all types of people who should have at least one thing in common: a love for good beer.","website":"http:\/\/boozebrothersbrewery.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/xaBLno\/upload_Ca9D8k-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/xaBLno\/upload_Ca9D8k-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/xaBLno\/upload_Ca9D8k-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/xaBLno\/upload_Ca9D8k-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/xaBLno\/upload_Ca9D8k-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-04-08 13:11:43","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:53:28","locations":[{"id":"Zhydrx","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2545 Progress Street","extendedAddress":"Suite D","locality":"Vista","region":"California","postalCode":"92081","phone":"(760) 295-0217","website":"http:\/\/boozebrothersbrewery.com\/","latitude":33.148172,"longitude":-117.218047,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-04-08 13:13:42","updateDate":"2015-08-26 16:23:19","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"ePDJvE","name":"Ebony & Ivory","nameDisplay":"Ebony & Ivory","description":"Southern Belle imperial brown ale with vanilla beans and cocoa nibs","abv":"8.7","styleId":37,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-08-27 16:31:16","updateDate":"2014-09-02 12:24:57","style":{"id":37,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Brown Ale","shortName":"American Brown","description":"American brown ales range from deep copper to brown in color.

So enjoy an Empyrean beer, the taste of dreams come true.","website":"http:\/\/www.empyreanbrewingco.com\/","established":"1990","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/dN5GFB\/upload_f53gdB-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/dN5GFB\/upload_f53gdB-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/dN5GFB\/upload_f53gdB-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/dN5GFB\/upload_f53gdB-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/dN5GFB\/upload_f53gdB-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:45:28","locations":[{"id":"kpdGGu","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"729 Q Street","locality":"Lincoln","region":"Nebraska","postalCode":"68508","phone":"402-434-5959","website":"http:\/\/www.empyreanbrewingco.com\/","latitude":40.8158011,"longitude":-96.7106424,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1990","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"vqph2C","name":"Main Brewery","isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2015-02-12 13:22:55","updateDate":"2015-02-12 17:15:36","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"XuKC0Z","name":"Edward's Portly Brown","nameDisplay":"Edward's Portly Brown","description":"Edward\u2019s Brown is a malty brown ale with a surprising hop presence.

The equinox, and the intrigue of equal night and day, has deep roots in history and ritual. But, at the same time, the equinox marks the changing of the season, and forces us to look toward the future. We find it interesting that the two days out of the year that have perfect light and dark balance also show the balance between the past and the future, tradition and innovation. Beer contains similar elements. Sure, there\u2019s the balance of flavors in a beer; sweet and bitter, rich and simple\u2026\r\n\r\nWe find another aspect of beer\u2019s balancing act fascinating. Historically, beer styles have developed because of limitations in local ingredients and the necessity to make do with what you have. However, due to global trade and modern shipping methods, limitations on ingredients have been removed. We can get any ingredients we want. While most modern brewers recognize the importance of beer styles and learn from the brewers who made them, they certainly don\u2019t limit themselves to making beers that fit into traditional definitions.\r\n\r\nOn one level our beers fit into some traditional styles, but we put our own twist on them. We want our beers to capture elements from the past and incorporate new ideas, ingredients and techniques into them. We\u2019re not afraid to try new things.\r\n\r\nAs a brewer, its playtime and work, balanced.","website":"http:\/\/www.equinoxbrewing.com\/","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wYyIFx\/upload_iB5vAJ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wYyIFx\/upload_iB5vAJ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wYyIFx\/upload_iB5vAJ-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wYyIFx\/upload_iB5vAJ-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wYyIFx\/upload_iB5vAJ-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:07:44","locations":[{"id":"YKa9wh","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"133 Remington Street","locality":"Fort Collins","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"80524","phone":"970-430-6489","website":"http:\/\/www.equinoxbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  12:00pm - 8:00pm\nTue:  12:00pm - 8:00pm\nWed:  12:00pm - 8:00pm\nThu:  12:00pm - 9:00pm\nFri:  12:00pm - 10:00pm\nSat:  11:00am - 10:00pm\nSun:  12:00pm - 7:00pm\n\n","latitude":40.586331,"longitude":-105.0757067,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2010","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2014-12-03 19:58:04","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"YwUp3q","name":"Fallow Fields","nameDisplay":"Fallow Fields","description":"This American Brown Ale has amazing malt depth and complexity while retaining a respectable hop profile.

Our goal is to brew world class beers and deliver them to our customers as fresh as possible making them the best beers in Texas and Louisiana. Our customers are beer lovers - people that appreciate great, full-flavored beers.\r\n\r\nOur small crew does everything at the brewery: brew the beer, filter the beer, keg the beer, bottle the beer, sell the beer and drink the beer. For us, this is a passion, not a job. We believe that this comes through in the beers we make. Our beers have soul.\r\n\r\nWe brew several different beers; some are year round, some are seasonal and a few are single batch brews. They are available in bars, restaurants, grocery stores, liquor stores and warehouse stores throughout Texas and Louisiana.\r\n\r\nOur first keg of beer was shipped on June 9, 1994. Founded by Brock Wagner and Kevin Bartol, we chose Houston because, other than living here, this was the largest city in the country that did not have a microbrewery. Brock was a longtime homebrewer and had considered opening a brewery as far back as college, although that was quickly dismissed as a silly idea.

The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery. Goose Island beers are now enjoyed in all 50 states and Europe.","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:46:51","locations":[{"id":"S2n5TB","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1800 West Fulton Street","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60612","phone":"1-800-466-7363","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","latitude":41.887107,"longitude":-87.6720969,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:33:51","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"D2gG2C","name":"Clybourn","streetAddress":"1800 North Clybourn Avenue","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60614","phone":"800-466-7363","latitude":41.9137242,"longitude":-87.65373,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1988","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:32:55","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"OUmpxX","name":"Festivus Ale","nameDisplay":"Festivus Ale","description":"\u201cFor the rest of us\u201d A full bodied reddish brown ale, with a super malty backbone, piney citrus flavor and a dry finish.
