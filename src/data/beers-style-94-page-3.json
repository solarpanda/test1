With an eye toward preserving and growing one-of-a-kind craft beers and brands, CBA was joined by Kona Brewing Company in 2010.\r\nWhen Kurt & Rob Widmer founded Widmer Brothers Brewing in 1984, they didn\u2019t confine their brewing exploration to strict style guidelines. To this day, Widmer Brothers continues to create handcrafted beers with a unique and unconventional twist on traditional styles that are award winning and please a wide range of craft beer lovers.\r\n\r\nRedhook began in a Seattle transmission shop in 1981, and those colorful roots are reflected in the brand\u2019s personality to this day. As one of the country\u2019s first craft breweries, Redhook continues to offer sessionable craft beers to consumers across the country.\r\n\r\nKona Brewing was founded in 1994 by the father and son team of Cameron Healy and Spoon Khalsa, who dreamed of crafting fresh, local island brews with spirit, passion and quality.

Our brewing process utilizes the traditional English method of upward infusion mashing in our combination mash lauter tun to create lagers and ales inspired by old world values, but with modern quality and consistency. The staff at The Lion Brewery is dedicated to producing true handcrafted beers, made right here in our century-old Brewhouse. All of our premium beers are made using only the four basic ingredients allowed by the Reinheitsgebot, or German purity law. Under the skillful supervision of our Master Brewer, Leo Orlandini, each of our lagers and ales are brewed in small batches using only the finest hops and malts available to guarantee the highest quality and freshness. Each product we brew is an original recipe especially created to deliver a fuller flavor than ordinary beers, yet with an approachable style and character. As a result, our beers have garnered numerous medals from the Great American Beer Festival and the World Beer Championships in recent years.\r\n\r\nIn 1974 the Lion Brewing Company bought the Stegmaier Brand.","website":"http:\/\/www.lionbrewery.com\/","established":"1857","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TwOeWu\/upload_VQOP01-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TwOeWu\/upload_VQOP01-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TwOeWu\/upload_VQOP01-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TwOeWu\/upload_VQOP01-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TwOeWu\/upload_VQOP01-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:00","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:50:50","locations":[{"id":"z0gnmN","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"700 North Pennsylvania Blvd.","locality":"Wilkes Barre","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"18705","phone":"800-233-8327","website":"http:\/\/www.lionbrewery.com\/","latitude":41.2556575,"longitude":-75.858261,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1857","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:00","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"KZhRcu","name":"Local's Light","nameDisplay":"Local's Light","abv":"3.6","styleId":94,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-07-31 18:43:51","updateDate":"2015-07-31 18:43:51","style":{"id":94,"categoryId":8,"category":{"id":8,"name":"North American Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"American-Style Light (Low Calorie) Lager","shortName":"American Light Lager","description":"These beers are extremely light colored, light in body, and high in carbonation.

The philosophy was to bring an appreciation of craft beer to the north with product education and creativity.  The process of appreciation through education we call beer liberation.\r\n\r\nToday Short\u2019s Brewing Company continues the effort to educate and liberate consumers.  We take pride in our hands on, mom and pop approach and the energy we put into the quality of our beer, food, staff, customers and facilities. We believe in the power of the smallness.   We intend on remaining a smaller, state wide beer distributor and focusing our energies close to home (the SBC Michigan stimulus package).

It was thirsty work. And that's where Coors Brewing Company came in. When we began in that same year, we were a small, family-owned brewery, located at the foot of the Rocky Mountains. We were busy creating the same kind of crisp, refreshing beer we're known for today. While hundreds of such family-owned breweries have come and gone in the years since, we believe the reasons for our success are simple. We've never compromised on quality in producing our award-winning brews and we've never lost sight of our rich Rocky Mountain heritage. Just as important, we've always believed in doing well by doing good. We treat our employees with respect, we support the local communities where we do business, and we strive to protect the environment.

They were the ones who identified the construction site for the new brewery. The choice of construction site was determined by the main factor, namely the availability of huge reserves of soft, crystal-clear water. Today, the water from Jurassic bedrock (290 m) ensures the high quality of our products.\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards, the enterprise gave the impetus to developing the largest corporation in Ukraine to produce beer, low alcohol and soft drinks, and mineral water.\r\n\r\nThe plant received its current name only in 1986, after the district of Kyiv with the same name. The word \u2018Obolon\u2019 comes from the times of Kievan Rus, when it denoted low riverside meadows.\r\n\r\nBuilt according to a Czech design, the brewery produced beer that gained wide popularity. After Ukraine became independent, Obolon was the first corporation to export hopped beverages to Europe and the USA. Obolon trademark beer started being perceived as traditional Ukrainian beer in the whole world.\r\n\r\nAfter a quarter of a century, Obolon has evolved into a world-renowned trademark.
