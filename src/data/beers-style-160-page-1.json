We've worked hard and are incredibly proud of the many successes we've enjoyed over the years. The Boston Beer Company has been cited as one of the best companies to work for by Boston Magazine, one of the Best Entry-Level Jobs by The Princeton Review, and our beers have won more awards than any other in history. Jim has been named an \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" by Inc. Magazine. Our brewers keep amazing us with innovative new brews, including Samuel Adams Utopias and our Samuel Adams Barrel Room Collection.\r\n\r\nJim has believed from the beginning that the more you know and understand about beer, the more you'll appreciate a beer like Samuel Adams Boston Lager. To begin that mission, all new employees go through intensive training on everything from ingredients, brewing, and beer styles, to taking care of the beer once it leaves the brewery. We're all beer lovers and protectors of the beer so we're trained how to identify off flavors and how to troubleshoot the causes. The passion for beer continues with an annual homebrew competition that we all take part in.\r\n\r\nOne of our wholesalers once asked Jim why he invested so much in training his people, when ultimately they might leave. Jim smiled and replied without hesitation: \"What if I didn't train them, and they stayed?\"\r\n\r\nEach year, usually in January, everyone gathers together. One of the highlights of the meeting is the beer trivia contest. With a culture so steeped in beer education and knowledge, winning is a pretty big deal. Recently, one of the hotel bartenders who was watching as the various teams arrived in costume with music and much enthusiasm and fanfare, said, \"I've always known Samuel Adams made the best beer in America, but now I see this is the greatest company in America.\" When you look around you see that The Boston Beer Company is a team of enthusiastic people who are passionate about beer and who really love coming to work every day to provide American drinkers with the best beer possible.\r\n\r\nThe Boston Beer Company, Inc. is a publicly-traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol, SAM.","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","established":"1984","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:24:45","locations":[{"id":"DF5YsC","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"30 Germania Street","locality":"Boston","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"02130","phone":"1-800-372-1131","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","latitude":42.314449,"longitude":-71.103365,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1984","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2015-12-02 19:22:03","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"MLUbXI","name":"Cincinnati","streetAddress":"1625 Central Parkway","locality":"Cincinnati","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45214","phone":"513-412-3200","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","latitude":39.1144986,"longitude":-84.5222061,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-12 13:10:57","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"XZ6L8a","name":"Production Brewery","streetAddress":"7880 Penn Drive","locality":"Breinigsville","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"18031","latitude":40.5759622,"longitude":-75.6290377,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2007","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-11-30 20:24:56","updateDate":"2015-12-02 19:22:03","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"pDmCJT","name":"Gratzerful Dead","nameDisplay":"Gratzerful Dead","description":"Gr\u00e4tzer is a Polish style beer that dates back to the Middle Ages.

However, we soon realized we were somewhat limited and constrained by which beers were actually available in the Miami market -due to distribution and other factors. And since we're all about unfettered drinking and out of the box thinking, the concept soon changed to: \"let's brew our own!\". This way we would be free to experiment with both well known and more obscure styles and experiment with flavor profiles and combinations. The possibilities, which once looked constrained, now appeared limitless.\r\n\r\nEnter Robert Tejon and Seth Hammond! After meeting and networking within Miami's local brewer community for the better part of a year, Diego met Robert and Seth. They decided to start making some test batches, which eventually led to making one-off pilot batches for nationally-renowned events (please see our \"events\" section). As momentum gathered, we realized that there was great potential in this concept and decided that the brewpub was definitely the way we wanted to go.\r\n\r\nAs Gravity Brew Lab, our mission is to bring you uncompromising, top quality beer. Our true purpose, though, is to give you a new experience every time you sit at one of our tables and ask for a glass of beer.","website":"http:\/\/www.gravitybrewlab.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/erOQsC\/upload_8FxTB5-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/erOQsC\/upload_8FxTB5-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/erOQsC\/upload_8FxTB5-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/erOQsC\/upload_8FxTB5-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/erOQsC\/upload_8FxTB5-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-09-15 22:43:22","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:16:33","locations":[{"id":"nOyUmq","name":"Brewery Restaurant","locality":"Miami","region":"Florida","postalCode":"33127","phone":"(786) 536-7085","website":"http:\/\/www.gravitybrewlab.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon 12pm - 12am\r\nTue 12pm - 12am\r\nWed 12pm - 12am\r\nThu 12pm - 12am\r\nFri 12pm - 4am\r\nSat 12pm - 4am\r\nSun 12pm - 4am","latitude":25.8105183,"longitude":-80.2042436,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-09-16 14:27:09","updateDate":"2015-09-16 16:19:29","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"3nAYkE","name":"Grodziskie","nameDisplay":"Grodziskie","description":"Grodziskie is a resurrection of the last indigenous Polish beer style to go extinct in the twentieth century.
