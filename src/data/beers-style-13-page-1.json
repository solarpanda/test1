You see we (John from NY and Rich from Boston) met in college and had to drink what beer we could afford in those days.\r\n\r\nAs the years went by, the better the beer we consumed, the more we were consumed by it.  We tried every beer imaginable.  We read about beer. We talked about beer. We began making our own beer.  And finally we started talking and dreaming about opening a brewery on the North Fork.\r\n\r\nIn the Spring of 2008 the dream became a reality when Rich heard about an old firehouse for sale in the Village of Greenport.  Driven by thirst more than brains, we bought the building in the middle of what has been called a Global Economic Meltdown.  Next we started the renovation.  Did we mention Global Economic Meltdown?  We tried to do most of the work ourselves and luckily got a lot of help from some good friends and family. \r\nThe promise of beer can be powerful. Our luck continued when on a snowy January day, with no roof on our brewery, we got a visit from DJ Swanson and his 2 young children. No one in their right mind would have joined us. DJ did and agreed to be our new head brewer. In April with roof replaced, windows installed, and drains dug, our brew house arrived and the idea of making Greenport Harbor beer began. Four months later in July of 2009 we were officially shipping (hand truck and family cars) our beer.\r\n\r\nToday our beer is served in over 200 places on Long Island (thank you Justin) and NYC.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re proud to say that since summer of 2009 we have been singled out for nearly every beer we have brewed from the Village Voice to the Tasting Table to TimeOut NY to Newsday to NY Examiner to Wall Street Journal to countless beer and food blogs.\r\nWe have a total of 13 employees if you include our forklift and delivery truck, which we do. We hope to add to this number in the next few months when we grow by 66 and 2\/3\u2019s percent by adding 2 new tanks. We are the only local brewery that brews 100% of our beer.

Beer was the mission, and liberation was the movement.  With a lot of elbow grease, blind ambition and a little luck, the quest to create a community pub in Northwest Lower Michigan began to take shape.  The philosophy was to bring an appreciation of craft beer to the north with product education and creativity.  The process of appreciation through education we call beer liberation.\r\n\r\nToday Short\u2019s Brewing Company continues the effort to educate and liberate consumers.  We take pride in our hands on, mom and pop approach and the energy we put into the quality of our beer, food, staff, customers and facilities. We believe in the power of the smallness.   We intend on remaining a smaller, state wide beer distributor and focusing our energies close to home (the SBC Michigan stimulus package).  Our goal is to get to a comfortable production volume, enjoy what we do and love life in Northern Michigan.","website":"http:\/\/www.shortsbrewing.com\/","established":"2004","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2016-02-04 14:44:21","locations":[{"id":"CzopCY","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"121 North Bridge Street","locality":"Bellaire","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49615","phone":"231-533-6622","website":"http:\/\/www.shortsbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sun - Thu: 11:00 am \u2013 11:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:00 am - 12:00 am","latitude":44.976269,"longitude":-85.210357,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2004","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"VbvIxS","name":"Arthur's English Old Ale","nameDisplay":"Arthur's English Old Ale","description":"A big malty ale brewed in the style of English Old Ales.
