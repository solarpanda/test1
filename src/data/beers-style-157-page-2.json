Within these unique and historic walls, we brew 20bbl batches of beer that sings with flavor and delights us. The yin\/yang of our brewing philosophy is hoppy\/sessionable and we aim to brew beers where \u201cthe first sip calls for the third\u201d.  We\u2019re a small team with big dreams and tend to smile while we sweat. We brew those styles which are most compelling to our thirst and we certainly hope you enjoy our brews as much as we do.\r\n\r\nRhinegeist means \u201cghost of the Rhine\u201d, and refers to our place here in the historic Brewery District in the Over the Rhine neighborhood of Cincinnati. At the turn of the century, this neighborhood was home to nearly 45,o00 inhabitants, most of them of German descent and 38 breweries. We hope to engender the spirit of camaraderie and hard work that we imagine those living and brewing in this neighborhood at that time embodied.\r\n\r\nWe self distribute our beer, which means each beer that you drink in a bar or restaurant is poured from a keg that we delivered cold in our refrigerated van (keep your eyes peeled for it around town). We like to keep beer as fresh as possible, which means that every keg we fill is immediately moved into cold storage where it sits until we load it onto our refrigerated van for delivery to the coldbox of each local account. Fresh beer is tasty beer, and that\u2019s our favorite kind.","website":"http:\/\/rhinegeist.com","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0s8yID\/upload_aZOo67-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0s8yID\/upload_aZOo67-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0s8yID\/upload_aZOo67-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0s8yID\/upload_aZOo67-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0s8yID\/upload_aZOo67-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-06-22 18:23:27","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:43:57","locations":[{"id":"202T0m","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1910 Elm St","locality":"Cincinnati","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45202","phone":"(513) 381-1356","website":"http:\/\/rhinegeist.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Thursday 4pm - 11pm\r\nFriday 4pm - 12am\r\nSaturday 12pm - 12am\r\nSunday 12pm - 7pm","latitude":39.1168193,"longitude":-84.5201739,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-06-22 18:26:59","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"auarNA","name":"Dry Hopped Cider","nameDisplay":"Dry Hopped Cider","description":"When Corey started cidermaking in Tassie in 2008 there weren\u2019t any traditional cider apples available for him to use.

From Doc's Draft Hard Apple Cider (great, semi-dry and effervescent refreshment) to the incredibly dry, delicate, and fragrant Doc's Draft Hard Pear Cider, to the tremendous Doc's Framboise, which is a dessert beverage that is on par with any dessert wine out there. The raspberry can be sipped on a long hot day...what a delicious enjoyment. The pear and raspberry are to die for and are absolutely unique! These two ciders rate with the great Belgian ale house, Lindemann's, whose fruit ales are among the best in the world.","website":"http:\/\/wvwinery.com\/cider\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/aoCWnL\/upload_yKG66u-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/aoCWnL\/upload_yKG66u-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/aoCWnL\/upload_yKG66u-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/aoCWnL\/upload_yKG66u-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/aoCWnL\/upload_yKG66u-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-09 20:57:21","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:05:48","locations":[{"id":"9TmI4y","name":"Main Cidery","streetAddress":"114 Little York Rd","locality":"Warwick","region":"New York","postalCode":"10990","phone":"(845) 258-6020","website":"www.wvwinery.com\/cider","latitude":41.291343,"longitude":-74.439319,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"cidery","locationTypeDisplay":"Cidery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-10 17:55:26","updateDate":"2015-03-10 17:55:26","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"mkrrka","name":"Heirloom 33","nameDisplay":"Heirloom 33","abv":"8.5","styleId":157,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-02 18:30:59","updateDate":"2015-06-18 17:22:13","style":{"id":157,"categoryId":12,"category":{"id":12,"name":"Mead, Cider, & Perry","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Other Specialty Cider or Perry","shortName":"Specialty Cider","abvMin":"5","abvMax":"12","ogMin":"1.045","ogMax":"1.1","fgMin":"0.995","fgMax":"1.02","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:49:22"},"breweries":[{"id":"UEl4ZF","name":"Millstone Cellars","nameShortDisplay":"Millstone Cellars","description":"From Farm to Bottle; we source local raw honey, fruits and apples to handcraft intriguing ciders and meads.","website":"http:\/\/www.millstonecellars.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/UEl4ZF\/upload_DHfPwf-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/UEl4ZF\/upload_DHfPwf-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/UEl4ZF\/upload_DHfPwf-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/UEl4ZF\/upload_DHfPwf-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/UEl4ZF\/upload_DHfPwf-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-08-03 17:17:42","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:57:20","locations":[{"id":"Pm2WWd","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2029 Monkton Road","locality":"Monkton","region":"Maryland","postalCode":"21111","phone":"443 470 9818","website":"http:\/\/www.millstonecellars.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sat:  12:00pm - 6:00pm\nSun:  12:00pm - 5:00pm\n\n","latitude":39.5762313,"longitude":-76.6101084,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"cidery","locationTypeDisplay":"Cidery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-08-04 11:04:30","updateDate":"2015-04-17 15:56:30","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"kXSWOO","name":"Henry Westons Medium Dry","nameDisplay":"Henry Westons Medium Dry","description":"This medium-dry sparkling cider has a good balance of acidity, sweetness and fruit flavours making it ideally suited for many occasions.
