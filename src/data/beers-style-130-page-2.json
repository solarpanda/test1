He started the Boulder, Colorado company with the 'natural philosophy' that he produce the highest quality honey wine on the market.\r\n\r\nBecause of this 'philosophy of mead', Redstone does not cork (to avoid oxidation) but instead uses swing top bottles. This ensures the mead will not breathe while cellaring plus offers a much longer shelf life once the bottle has been opened.\r\n\r\nIn keeping with the 'natural' approach, Redstone does not add any sulfites, a known allergen, as honey is it's own natural preservative. Redstone only pasteurizes the must (unfermented mead) and never boils. The company strives to feature the flavors of the fermentable as much as possible.\r\n\r\nIn 2003 Redstone Meadery brought the International Mead Festival (www.meadfest.com) to Boulder, Colorado and with that helped to establish mead as its own beverage category. Also at this time Redstone spearheaded the creation of the International Mead Association (www.meadfest.org) to help promote and educate the masses about the world's first fermented beverage.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Redstone products are distributed to 20 states across the U.S., making it the widest distributed wine from the state of Colorado and one of the most widely distributed meads in the country!
