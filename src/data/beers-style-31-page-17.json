Summit hops are used exclusively in the boil for bitterness, flavor and aroma but it doesn\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2?\u00ac\u00e2?\u00a2t end there. Post-fermentation dry hopping allows the 9.5% ABV monstrosity to gently coax the citrus rind and grapefruit aroma to join the 100 IBUs already present.

For H2P this year I changed the recipe from the two previous batches, along with the hops and hop schedule. The past two batches featured Zythos and 7 C's opposite Simcoe. This year and in the future, it will be a single-hop Simcoe IPA. Since it's technically a different beer, but the soul of it is still the same, we are going to call this H2P going forward. As a former Pitt student, I know the Pitt faithful use HTP and H2P interchangeably, so it seemed fitting to change the \"T\" to a \"2\" for version 2.0. Inspired by the IPAs I fell in love with in California and deepened my college experience in South Oakland, H2P is a 8.0% west coast-style IPA brewed with four kinds of malted barley and a ridiculous amount of Simcoe hops with five kettle additions and two dry hops. The nose of the beer is rich in pine and fruit notes, with hints passion fruit, apricot, along with woodsy and floral undertones. Medium bodied, this beer starts with a mildly bitter taste that gives way to the pine and fruit notes found in the nose on the back end. H2P is a bright and crisp IPA that was designed to be highly drinkable, exceedingly flavorful and aromatic, but without being abrasively bitter. As production allows, we hope to continue to provide this beer to the Pittsburgh market and the Pitt faithful each year for Pittsburgh Craft Beer Week.","abv":"8.6","availableId":5,"styleId":31,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/Lc6KDE\/upload_q8sop9-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/Lc6KDE\/upload_q8sop9-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/Lc6KDE\/upload_q8sop9-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-01-13 19:14:00","updateDate":"2016-01-18 18:30:25","available":{"id":5,"name":"Spring","description":"Available during the spring months."},"style":{"id":31,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ale","shortName":"Imperial IPA","description":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma.

In September 1999, Starr Hill Brewery was founded. Named after the local neighborhood, the brewery shared its space with the legendary Starr Hill Music Hall. Since then Starr Hill's delicious craft beers have become a favorite to visiting beer lovers, musicians, and music fans from around the world.\r\n\r\nIn response to the growing demand, Starr Hill moved from this small operation to a larger facility several miles outside of town in 2005. The brewery and tap room are still based in Crozet, nestled in the rolling foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Starr Hill's year-round, seasonal and limited-release brews are now enjoyed in bars, restaurants and music venues in the Mid Atlantic and Southeast and are also available at many grocery and convenience stores throughout the region. Among the most award-winning breweries on the East Coast, Starr Hill has won 21 Great American Beer Festival, World Beer Cup and Great British Beer Festival medals.\r\n\r\nLed by Brewmaster Robbie O'Cain, Starr Hill's team is striving to make creative and world-class beer every day.

We make beer and whiskey in our \u201cbrewstillery\u201d, and we make it by hand one batch at a time with lots of love and attention. As a combined operation, we use much of the same equipment to make both our beer and our whiskey, and we can do this because there are a lot of similarities between the two processes. It\u2019s actually a really cool process to see, and we invite you to come take a tour and learn about it for yourself.","website":"http:\/\/www.drinkrangercreek.com\/","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/cZha6q\/upload_6iWLgP-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/cZha6q\/upload_6iWLgP-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/cZha6q\/upload_6iWLgP-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/cZha6q\/upload_6iWLgP-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/cZha6q\/upload_6iWLgP-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:14:14","locations":[{"id":"rKXfsB","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"4834 Whirlwind Dr.","locality":"San Antonio","region":"Texas","postalCode":"78217","phone":"210-775-2099","website":"http:\/\/www.drinkrangercreek.com\/","latitude":29.5295495,"longitude":-98.3969518,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2010","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"4EMoVA","name":"Hardcore Chimera","nameDisplay":"Hardcore Chimera","description":"An American style Imperial IPA brewed with Citra, Simcoe, Columbus, Cascade and Mosaic hops.

There is just enough malt to give this beer some backbone, but not enough to take the hops away from the center stage.","abv":"8","ibu":"120","glasswareId":6,"srmId":13,"styleId":31,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/CFIZtr\/upload_Y3Prr0-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/CFIZtr\/upload_Y3Prr0-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/CFIZtr\/upload_Y3Prr0-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:21","updateDate":"2015-12-16 03:35:34","glass":{"id":6,"name":"Snifter","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"srm":{"id":13,"name":"13","hex":"CB6200"},"style":{"id":31,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ale","shortName":"Imperial IPA","description":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma.
