In 2006 we decided to let the brewery evolve to an even more natural state, and by October of that year we were granted Certified Organic status. In a sense, we were getting back to our roots. People have been brewing organically for over 6000 years; the current practice of large-scale industrial farming with synthetic fertilizers and pesticides is an aberration of traditional farming, and therefore brewing, practices. Choosing organic production is also in keeping with the spirit of our home town of Nelson, a laid-back, progressive community nestled in the heart of the Kootenays. With limitless backcountry skiing and hiking at our back door, as well as a host of other outdoor activities year-round, brewing an organic beer in Nelson just seems like the natural thing to do.\r\n\r\nWhat does it mean to be organic? Organic certification is a guarantee that our beer and its ingredients were produced without the use of synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, or genetic engineering. Our processes, cleaning and sanitation regimes must also adhere to a strict set of organic principles and be approved by our organic certification body. Being organic also signifies a commitment to environmental sustainability. Our goal is to eventually source all of our ingredients as locally as possible. Most of our barley is already malted right here in BC, and we are working with local farmers toward the planting of certified organic hops. Our spent materials are recycled by local farmers as feed and compost.","website":"http:\/\/nelsonbrewing.com\/","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:03","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:53:01","locations":[{"id":"YoA3mZ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"512 Latimer Street","locality":"Nelson","region":"British Columbia","phone":"1-250-352-3582","latitude":49.4883757,"longitude":-117.2900382,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"CA","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:03","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"CA","name":"CANADA","displayName":"Canada","isoThree":"CAN","numberCode":124,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"3BU9A8","name":"Paint Creek Porter","nameDisplay":"Paint Creek Porter","description":"This robust porter is brewed with a lot of Chocolate malt for a rich, velvety, roasted flavor.
