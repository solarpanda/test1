A combination that guarantees high quality. It is quality that is the basis of Zeunerts\u2019 business. The Bavarian art of brewing is without a doubt the finest in the world. As early as 1859, Christoffer August Zeunert introduced copper vats and open fermenting tubs in production and the tradition of ageing the beer to the perfect maturity and flavour. It goes without saying that we follow the German Beer Purity Laws.\r\n\r\n ONLY FIRST-CLASS RAW MATERIALS WILL DO HERE\r\n\r\nWe are extremely careful about raw materials. The water, the most important prerequisite for a good beer, gives us a strong advantage in quality. The fresh water of the Swedish North is the best water from which to make beer. At least that was the opinion of Christoffer August Zeunert. Hops are the spice of beer. The little hop cones contain the hundreds of flavours that give beer its bitterness, flavour and aroma.

Light malt flavors and grainy aroma are complemented by spicy and lemon-like hop notes.
