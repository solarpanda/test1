This beer is golden in color with a moderate malty character with full hop flavor true to the classic ale that has traveled on sailing ships from England to India.  Bold and brazen.\r\n\r\nThis is Highland\u2019s version of the classic British beer which was designed to survive the long journeys from England to India on sailing ships. The higher alcohol content and much higher hop level provided the longevity necessary for the casks to arrive in India in a most drinkable condition.

Both had an entrepanerial passion, but never thought of a microbrewery as their business.  \"The decision was made for us.  Make a business out of something you love to do and you will never work another day in your life\" the couple states.  A lot of hard work and a love for good beer motivates the business. \r\nWe decided to open Eastern Shore Brewing after talking with friends from St. Michael's Winery, and were told that the town was in need of a microbrewery.  After some discussion (less than you may think), we agreed and were on our way.  With some trials along the way in year one, year two proved to be the pinicle of change.  An increase in brewery size promoted an increase of staff.  Randall Marquis came on board as brewmaster in March of 2009 and has made his presence known.  An undergratudate of Franklin Marshall College, and a brewing certificate holder from UC Davis, Randy is a large portion of the success of Eastern Shore Brewing.  Three beers took home medals in the Maryland Govenor's cup competition (Bronze for Lighthause Golden Ale, Silver for the Duck Duck Goose Porter and a Silver for the St.ichael's Amber ALe) on October 9th.  And although happy with the medals, Eastern Shore Brewing's goals are to continue to grow the busines and improve their products.  Distribution ranges from Cambridge to Kent Island on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, and recently moved into Ellicott City, Maryland.

We produce inspired ales, with lots of care, in very small batches.\r\n\r\nOur custom built, 3BBL brew-house ensures a keen eye to every detail and fosters creativity in both our recipes and beer styles.\r\n\r\nDandy Ales are living beers; naturally conditioned bottles, kegs, and casks. This return to the true ale tradition ensures the living yeast in the unfiltered and unpasteurized beer will continue to work with the premium malt and complex hops from the moment it is pitched in the fermenters, until it passes your lips!\r\n\r\nWe are pleased to offer a top notch tasting room on site where you can taste any or all of our eight taps, including Dandy favourites and special one-off beers. There are also tours and a small shop to pick up a variety of Dandy merchandise!\r\n\r\nWe share a passion for not only brewing, but the people, process, experiences, and personal touches that make the real ale experience so special.","website":"http:\/\/thedandybrewingcompany.com\/","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-04-06 17:27:32","updateDate":"2016-05-07 15:11:07","locations":[{"id":"K6PeNv","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"#11 1826 25TH AVENUE NE","locality":"Calgary","region":"AB","postalCode":"T2E 7K1","phone":"+1 403-769-9399","website":"http:\/\/thedandybrewingcompany.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sat:  12:00pm - 10:00pm\nSun:  12:00pm - 4:00pm\nThu:  4:00pm - 8:00pm\nFri:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\n\nMonday-Wednesday: Closed\r\nThursday: 4pm-8pm\r\nFriday: 4pm-10pm\r\nSaturday: Noon-10pm\r\nSunday: Noon-4pm","latitude":51.0751355,"longitude":-114.0147848,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"nano","locationTypeDisplay":"Nano Brewery","countryIsoCode":"CA","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-04-06 17:27:33","updateDate":"2016-05-07 15:07:46","country":{"isoCode":"CA","name":"CANADA","displayName":"Canada","isoThree":"CAN","numberCode":124,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"ij7Jvr","name":"O'Hara's Double IPA","nameDisplay":"O'Hara's Double IPA","description":"A bigger brother to O\u2019Hara\u2019s Irish Pale ale, this dark amber ale is 7.5% ABV and offers smooth warming toffee malt flavours contrasting with zesty citrus from the generous hopping.","abv":"7.5","glasswareId":5,"availableId":4,"styleId":2,"isOrganic":"N","beerVariationId":"xMYwEj","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-07 18:53:08","updateDate":"2013-05-09 19:23:56","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":2,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"English-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"English IPA","description":"Most traditional interpretations of English-style India pale ales are characterized by medium-high hop bitterness with a medium to medium-high alcohol content.
