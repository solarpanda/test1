In 1996 the brewery was installed by New World Brewing Systems in the space behind our retail store and production began in September. In May of 2005 we open our second brewery in Scripps Ranch.  We currently distribute five of our favorite beers, Yellowtail Pale Ale,  Calico Amber Ale , Big Eye I.P.A., Black Marlin Porter and Wahoo Wheat Beer to a thirsty San Diego.  Come to our brewery and we will gladly give you a tour and allow you to sample our newest selection of beers. Currently our beer is available in twelve ounce bottles to 15.5 gallon kegs. We also offer half gallon and gallon glass jugs to go. Kegs are available for rent to the public with a minimum deposit.  The name for our brewery comes from the point where Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo first set foot in California. Located on the Point Loma Peninsula, Ballast Point is considered the gateway to San Diego Harbor. Stones from this area were used as ballast in the cargo holds of sailing ships returning to the eastern seaboard. Many New England streets are still lined with the cobblestones brought back from San Diego.","website":"http:\/\/www.ballastpoint.com\/","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:45","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:39:04","locations":[{"id":"PckBjw","name":"Home Brew Mart","streetAddress":"5401 Linda Vista Road","extendedAddress":"#406","locality":"San Diego","region":"California","postalCode":"92110","phone":"(619) 295-2337","website":"http:\/\/www.ballastpoint.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Tasting Room & Store Hours\r\nMonday-Friday, 11:00-7:00\r\nSaturday-Sunday, 10:00-5:00","latitude":32.7667586,"longitude":-117.1952129,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:45","updateDate":"2014-09-29 20:33:49","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"a7VHpi","name":"Scripps Ranch Brewery","streetAddress":"10051 Old Grove Rd","locality":"San Diego","region":"California","postalCode":"92131","phone":"(858) 695-2739","website":"http:\/\/www.ballastpoint.com\/","latitude":32.898466,"longitude":-117.110794,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-12-07 00:05:42","updateDate":"2015-06-11 14:39:57","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"cLcfTf","name":"Tasting Room & Kitchen","streetAddress":"2215 India St","locality":"San Diego","region":"California","postalCode":"92101","phone":"(619) 255-7213","website":"http:\/\/www.ballastpoint.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  11:00am - 11:00pm\nTue:  11:00am - 11:00pm\nWed:  11:00am - 11:00pm\nThu:  11:00am - 11:00pm\nFri:  11:00am - 11:00pm\nSat:  11:00am - 11:00pm\nSun:  11:00am - 9:00pm\n\n","latitude":32.7277143,"longitude":-117.1697202,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-21 12:03:59","updateDate":"2015-06-11 13:48:56","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"1zYgG4","name":"Miramar","streetAddress":"9045 Carroll Way","locality":"San Diego","region":"California","postalCode":"92121","phone":"8587906900","website":"www.ballastpoint.com","latitude":32.8881618,"longitude":-117.1580141,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2014","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-06-09 16:08:18","updateDate":"2015-06-16 14:59:03","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"gRg0OA","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"9045 Carroll Way","locality":"San Diego","region":"California","postalCode":"92121","phone":"8587906900","website":"www.ballastpoint.com","hoursOfOperation":"Mon\u2013Sat 11:00am\u201311:00pm\r\nSunday 11:00am\u20139:00pm","latitude":32.8881618,"longitude":-117.1580141,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2015-06-09 20:31:45","updateDate":"2015-06-16 14:59:48","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"kr3KqQ","name":"Ballast Point Long Beach","streetAddress":"110 N.

Whole ingredients are used with traditional brewing equipment which is controlled by state of the art systems that manage temperature throughout the brewing process. These same systems harvest waste BTU's, capturing the energy that would normally be lost and reusing it to preheat ingredients, maintain product temperatures, and even heat the taproom via an in-floor heating system. Waste materials such as process water and spent grain are also captured and stored for fertilization and irrigation of our crops.\r\n\r\nThe prep table in the brewery quite often looks like the prep area in a fine restaurant. Fresh herbs, fruits and vegetables are a common sight, along with an amazing array of spices, roots and even flowers. Whole foods, fresh frozen or dried are used, artificial flavorings, extracts and coloring agents are not. The beer is unfiltered, its clarity being attained by the addition of natural clarifying agents and allowing ample time for the beer to condition.\r\n\r\nBrewery Terra Firma began brewing operations in May of 2013, with the taproom opening to the public in July of the same year.","website":"http:\/\/www.breweryterrafirma.com\/","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-11-18 12:30:28","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:48:26","locations":[{"id":"1QFuku","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2959 Hartman Rd","locality":"Traverse City","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49685","phone":"(231) 929-1600","website":"http:\/\/www.breweryterrafirma.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  10:00am - 10:00pm\nSun:  2:00pm - 9:00pm\n\n10:00 AM to 10:00 PM Monday through Saturday, and from 2:00 PM to 9:00 PM on Sunday","latitude":44.7154521,"longitude":-85.6354376,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-11-18 12:32:00","updateDate":"2014-09-29 20:36:47","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"M7sByD","name":"Bee Keeper","nameDisplay":"Bee Keeper","description":"A light, dry, refreshing summer ale.

Please enjoy our beers as much as we enjoy creating them.","website":"http:\/\/www.whitehorsebrewing.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/kZsjqY\/upload_NCBv7C-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/kZsjqY\/upload_NCBv7C-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/kZsjqY\/upload_NCBv7C-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/kZsjqY\/upload_NCBv7C-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/kZsjqY\/upload_NCBv7C-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-05-14 12:41:18","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:54:08","locations":[{"id":"z1Oq48","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"824 Diamond St","locality":"Berlin","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"15530","phone":"(814) 233-3043","website":"http:\/\/Www.whitehorsebrewing.com","hoursOfOperation":"Thu - Fri: 5:00 pm - 9:00 pm\r\nSat: 9:00 am - 5:00 pm","latitude":39.926214,"longitude":-78.95578,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-05-14 12:41:48","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"SFqZX6","name":"Built to Last","nameDisplay":"Built to Last","description":"From sea to shining sea was once only a dream.

In 1986, Schirf opened the first brewery in the resort town of Park City and named his beers after the majestic Wasatch Mountains that rise just east of Salt Lake City. In July 1989, Schirf Brewing opened its new company headquarters and the first brew pub in Utah at the top of historic Main Street in Park City.\r\n\r\nIn fact, it was Schirf who proposed the bill to the Utah Legislature in 1988 that would make brew pubs legal in Utah.

The restaurant and brewery is located in downtown Farmington, on 101 East Main Street. It was formerly called the Andrews Building, and was built and opened in 1912. It was built to house The Farmington Drug Store and The Farmington Times-Hustler Newspaper (now The Daily Times), which became the longest standing drugstore and fountain in New Mexico.\r\n\r\nThe unique decor consists mostly of priceless items found in the building during the renovation. Three Rivers believes in preserving their historical heritage of downtown Farmington. The restaurant was expanded in July, 1999. The addition includes an outdoor private patio, a bar, and the largest beer label and beer coaster collections in New Mexico. The restaurant has occupancy to provide for large party dining and special private parties. We also sell t-shirts, caps and 1\/2 gallon jugs of all our brews.","website":"http:\/\/www.threeriversbrewery.com\/","established":"1997","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:09:09","locations":[{"id":"aIEysX","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"101 E.

Hill Street Honey\u2019s bitterness is complimented by a whole bunch of New Jersey harvested honey that we add in during key parts of the brewing process.\r\n\r\nThese separately timed additions help spread out and layer the honey sweetness and citrus aromas throughout the brew thanks to the honey from the orange blossom. All of this complemented with smooth, slight biscuit flavors from the several types of grains we add in there. All this is brewed up then the magic of yeast takes over and we exclusively use yeast from Jersey\u2019s own yeast company that just helps meld all of the flavors together into a wonderful American Ale.\r\n\r\nIt is a simple, delicious anytime-of-year session beer, yet it has a whole bunch of complex layers to it if one breaks it down.

We will start brewing beer in the next few weeks and plan to open a restaurant in May of 2013.","website":"http:\/\/portsidedistillery.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/D8P7hU\/upload_ZhQeVO-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/D8P7hU\/upload_ZhQeVO-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/D8P7hU\/upload_ZhQeVO-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/D8P7hU\/upload_ZhQeVO-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/D8P7hU\/upload_ZhQeVO-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-11-30 11:37:54","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:38:59","locations":[{"id":"4iDXFJ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1100 West 9th Street","locality":"Cleveland","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"44113","phone":"(216) 990-5211","website":"http:\/\/portsidedistillery.com\/","latitude":41.501556,"longitude":-81.702833,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-11-30 11:38:31","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"j4LAnq","name":"Honey Ale","nameDisplay":"Honey Ale","styleId":126,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/j4LAnq\/upload_tOZKdr-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/j4LAnq\/upload_tOZKdr-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/j4LAnq\/upload_tOZKdr-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-04-29 17:40:51","updateDate":"2015-12-17 13:31:21","style":{"id":126,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Specialty Honey Lager or Ale","shortName":"Honey Beer","description":"These beers are brewed using honey in addition to malted barley.
