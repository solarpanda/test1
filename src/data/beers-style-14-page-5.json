We support anything from school groups to ski clubs to horse rescue to the mentors program because, well, they support us and honestly it\u2019s the right thing to do.\r\n\r\nDough. We like dough. It fits well in wallets and tastes good under cheese. We like to think we\u2019ve got some good dough. We make pizza crust, we make sandwich bread, and we make finely crafted dog sweaters. Alright, we don\u2019t make the last one, but we COULD if we wanted to. We take pride in the freshness of our dough and veggies. Our dough was made today. It wasn\u2019t made in Topeka, frozen, shipped here, and warmed up. Ask who made it and he or she is probably in the kitchen.\r\n\r\nWhy no Straws? We know you didn\u2019t get one. You\u2019ll use them for about seven minutes and then we have to throw them away. It\u2019s nothing personal. If you absolutely need one we\u2019re happy to oblige, but we\u2019re trying to reduce our non-recyclables, keep our landfills at a minimum, and keep plastic out of our oceans. Find a kid and ask them about plastic. Plastic pollutes our oceans and air, so we serve our beverages in glass. If you want to bring a kid cup from home, we\u2019ll fill it up!\r\n\r\nWhat, no Coasters? You\u2019d be amazed at how many coasters we pick up off the floor. If our tables were Peruvian mahogany, inlaid with reclaimed oak from an historic church in New Brunswick, we\u2019d say \u201check yeah, give that pizza patron a coaster!\u201d Let\u2019s conserve together.\r\n\r\nHopefully you\u2019re now thinking, \u201cWow Henrietta, these are some globally concerned restaurateurs.\u201d But, then again, maybe you\u2019re wondering about the lack of ice in the sodas? Are we trying to conserve ice bergs? Nope. We don\u2019t even know any icebergs. Our soda\u2019s are handmade with the finest extracts available, fantastic water and cane sugar. They\u2019re served at cellar temps just like our beers, so you get a full flavored beverage that doesn\u2019t need to be watered down. There\u2019s a saying in Colorado, Whiskey\u2019s for drinking, water\u2019s for fighting. (We also have Whiskey, no fighting). If you want ice, just ask. We\u2019ll not think less of you. Becoming a soda pop connoisseur takes time.\r\n\r\nFrom all of us at Moonlight Pizza: Kick back, order another beer, enjoy the sunset, and don\u2019t forget your leftovers!

After Frederic\u2019s passing, his widow Emma owned the business in entirety and it was shortly prior to her death that she instigated the formation of Frederic Robinson Limited. 4th generation Robinsons, Frederic, John and Cecil joined the board and continued to build the company alongside their father William.\r\n\r\nWith bottling commencing from a new building in 1908, new offices in 1913 and a new brewhouse in 1929, by William\u2019s death in 1933, despite the countries difficult economic climate, Robinsons was strongly positioned for further growth. Over the following years, the estate grew by acquisition, new buildings and extending the geographical area. The first Welsh house \u2013 The Black Lion was bought in 1943. William Robinson, would have been proud to hear John, his great grandchild, was honoured with a knighthood in 1958 for political and public services in Cheshire- 120 years after William purchased the Unicorn Inn. The early 1950\u2019s saw 5th generation Robinsons, Peter, Dennis and David, starting to join the business.\r\n\r\nOver the past 6 decades Robinsons has continued to grow. 15th October 1975 saw the first bottling at a newly built packaging centre in Bredbury- ongoing development at UPC (Unicorn Packaging Centre) means all our beers are now transferred from Unicorn Brewery to Bredbury for packaging and distribution once fermentation is complete. Robinsons\u2019 bottled ales such as Old Tom and Unicorn are distributed worldwide. The sixth generation strive to build further upon the family legacy. Neil, Veronica, Paul, Oliver and William were elected to the board in September 2003, followed three years later by Sara, who is now Company Secretary and John in May 2009.\r\n\r\nOur eyes are firmly on the future as we develop brewery, brands and pubs at pace. With over \u00a35 million investment in a new Brew House (including the World\u2019s largest hopnik, which strains hops to maximise aroma and flavour), Training Centre for excellence and Visitors Centre, there is much to look forward to.","website":"http:\/\/www.robinsonsbrewery.com\/","established":"1838","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/OEO8JG\/upload_ykqvVX-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/OEO8JG\/upload_ykqvVX-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/OEO8JG\/upload_ykqvVX-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/OEO8JG\/upload_ykqvVX-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/OEO8JG\/upload_ykqvVX-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:46:20","locations":[{"id":"lxWkzT","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Unicorn Brewery","locality":"Stockport","region":"Cheshire","postalCode":"SK11JJ","phone":"44-(0161)-480-6571","website":"http:\/\/www.robinsonsbrewery.com\/","latitude":53.4101496,"longitude":-2.1551029,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"GB","yearOpened":"1838","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"GB","name":"UNITED KINGDOM","displayName":"United Kingdom","isoThree":"GBR","numberCode":826,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"jYrMSW","name":"Olde Forest English Strong Ale","nameDisplay":"Olde Forest English Strong Ale","description":"Our interpretation of a classic style.
