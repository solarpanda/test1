Unsure whether to offer a light session beer or a fun ball-buster as our warm weather seasonal, we decided on a beer that would be \u201ca big, fatty boombalatty\u201d version of a Belgian white. And away we went, taking a recipe for a white beer and ramping up the grain bill by 50%; we dropped the amount of wheat by 75% to keep the beer rough around the edges. We bucked tradition by steering the bitterness in the direction of a pale ale, and coupling hops with coriander in the fermenter. The resulting beer gives you all the bubblegum goodness of a big Belgian, with enough crispness to cut through the sweet profile, thus making you want to sip it again and again.

The reason for so lofty a goal was of course to cheaply serve the more important purpose of the business--getting beer to the beer drinker, putting bottles on the shelf. However, even \u201ccheap\u201d was expensive to us. Pinching pennies and moving cautiously wasn\u2019t helping us reach our self imposed deadline of Summer of 2006. Then we met the good folks at Sand Creek Brewing Co (Black River Falls, WI) who agreed to bring us on as customers, allowing us to use their facility to get the beer brewed. We were thus able to skip the hard lessons of construction pitfalls and went straight to filling stainless steel tanks with beer. \r\n\r\nThe scrape-together building and used equipment model was then blacked out from the \u201cPhase 1\u201d section of the business plan. Aran went on the road to be hands on at Sand Creek; Chris went on the road to sell beer. We have since acquired another property in Spring Green (known affectionately as the Shitty Barn), and we have often been heard threatening to build a brewery on this site, sometimes quite convincingly. But \u201cif it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it\u201d seems to be the winning adage. So until we break it, we won\u2019t likely fix our present model. \r\n\r\nSo that is the back story--the mental seasoning for your next sip of Furthermore Beer. Fair warning to the newcomer: those who like our beers always seem to find at least one to stick in the \u201chate\u201d column\u2014ant that\u2019s always one that someone else places in the \u201clove\u201d column with a glittery heart sticker next to it. So remember, if you have distaste for one of our beers, it could our failings, or it could be your poor upbringing and resulting prejudices--so hate with an open mind.","website":"http:\/\/www.furthermorebeer.com\/","established":"2005","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/www.furthermorebeer.com\/mailing-list","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/JuFsla\/upload_pzSlep-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/JuFsla\/upload_pzSlep-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/JuFsla\/upload_pzSlep-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/JuFsla\/upload_pzSlep-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/JuFsla\/upload_pzSlep-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:19:24","locations":[{"id":"SY2b6E","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"525 East Madison Street","extendedAddress":"PO Box 776","locality":"Spring Green","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"53588","phone":"608-588-3300","website":"http:\/\/www.furthermorebeer.com\/","latitude":43.18111,"longitude":-90.072391,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Il7zdK","name":"Fiction","nameDisplay":"Fiction","description":"Description: Dry hopped blonde Belgian Extra Pale ale with intense bouquet of lychee, kiwi and citrus.\r\n\r\nMalts: Pilsner\r\nHops: Nelson Sauvin, Motueka","abv":"6","ibu":"40","glasswareId":5,"styleId":62,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/Il7zdK\/upload_HnnpMC-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/Il7zdK\/upload_HnnpMC-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/Il7zdK\/upload_HnnpMC-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-10 17:58:05","updateDate":"2015-12-17 17:56:48","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"style":{"id":62,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"Belgian Pale","description":"Belgian-style pale ales are characterized by low but noticeable hop bitterness, flavor, and aroma.

At the turn of the century, this neighborhood was home to nearly 45,o00 inhabitants, most of them of German descent and 38 breweries. We hope to engender the spirit of camaraderie and hard work that we imagine those living and brewing in this neighborhood at that time embodied.\r\n\r\nWe self distribute our beer, which means each beer that you drink in a bar or restaurant is poured from a keg that we delivered cold in our refrigerated van (keep your eyes peeled for it around town). We like to keep beer as fresh as possible, which means that every keg we fill is immediately moved into cold storage where it sits until we load it onto our refrigerated van for delivery to the coldbox of each local account.

The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery. Goose Island beers are now enjoyed in all 50 states and Europe.","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:46:51","locations":[{"id":"S2n5TB","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1800 West Fulton Street","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60612","phone":"1-800-466-7363","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","latitude":41.887107,"longitude":-87.6720969,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:33:51","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"D2gG2C","name":"Clybourn","streetAddress":"1800 North Clybourn Avenue","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60614","phone":"800-466-7363","latitude":41.9137242,"longitude":-87.65373,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1988","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:32:55","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"ha20Ap","name":"Fleur De Houblon","nameDisplay":"Fleur De Houblon","description":"Nothing is more evocative of summer than flowers, and the favorite flowers of brewers are hops, Fleur De Houblon Ale (Hop Flower Ale) is a rich gold color, with distinct floral hops in the aroma that follow through in the taste.
