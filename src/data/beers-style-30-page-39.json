Linus and Lila Hall moved to Nashville from Mississippi in 1996, with Linus going to work as a tire engineer for Bridgestone and Lila as a curator for the Parthenon. Trying to make tires more round proved to be less fulfilling than making great beer, so with the encouragement of Lila, Linus quit his job, got a business degree from Vanderbilt and a craft-brewing education through a course at the American Brewer's Guild, and did an internship under Garrett Oliver at Brooklyn Brewery. Linus found a used 10 bbl brewing system from a brewpub in Iowa that had gone out of business, and went to work restoring a corner of the old Marathon Motorworks building for their brewery.

Exclusively brewed with wet hops at a rate of over 7 LBS per BBL (31gal) of beer, the Hop Prophet yields an aroma of fresh citrus zest followed by a delicate, yet pronounced juicy bitterness. A blend of domestic Pale Ale malt, British Marris Otter malt, and a touch of crystal malt, contribute a clean, off-dry mouthfeel with subtle notes of honey and melon fruit.

This smalltime hobby of making beer in a tiny apartment blossomed into a fulltime career, brewing commercially. Towards the end of 1993, Tim attended UC Davis in Northern California to study Fermentation Science. Upon returning to Salt Lake, he aligned himself with a startup brewery called Uinta Brewing Company. The concept for this startup was to brew the freshest beer available in the State of Utah while limiting the alcohol percentage to 3.2 by weight (4% by volume).

Chris Hunt and Duncan Guy began their brewing education in the Barley Mob Brewers homebrewing club and continued to search for unique and distinctive ale and lager formulas. They decided to offer their creations to the public through a small batch microbrewery in 2006.  Soon thereafter, award-winning brewer Courtney Tyvand joined the two and presented his smoked porter at the brewery\u2019s first beer dinner in October of 2006.\r\n\r\nThe brewery is located on the ground floor of a historic building at 4015 Tennessee Avenue in St. Elmo.  The building is constructed of foot-square cedar timbers and two-foot thick walls made of granite stone and mortar.  Built in 1911 as a packaging factory for K-Rations for WWI, we occasionally find artifacts from that era in the building walls and ceiling.  The brewery shares space with the Chattanooga U-Brew, a brew-on-premises business owned by Greg McCort. \r\n\r\nMBBC is proud to offer small batch specialty ales and lagers in kegs of various sizes.  A tasting room is part of the brewery; samples of our beers can be tasted and tested on premises.  Occasionally we have tasting events or tapping events at the brewery or at a nearby bar or restaurant.

Soon after, we were introduced to our first Belgian style beers (Chimay, LaChouffe) and have been hooked on good beer ever since.  It progressed to the inevitable challenge of making our own home brew versions of the shared beers we loved and with the donation of our first brewing equipment from a friend, we started our beer making journey about 18 years ago.  From the beginning, we both found common ground having similar tastes in beer styles which progressed to a shared obsession of trying to figure out how our favorites were made.  We both shared in the fun of sharing our results with friends and watching their reactions, which kept us motivated to make more.  Now, I think we play to each other\u0080\u0099s strengths.  Mike is excited about the technical part of brewing and Greg enjoys determining flavor combinations and fun new things to try.  Our joint passion to make fun, creative craft beer coupled with our individual strengths makes a good brewing team that works well together.","website":"http:\/\/www.deviatebrewing.com\/","established":"2015","mailingListUrl":"mikeo@deviatebrewing.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/buQPij\/upload_0vHMMZ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/buQPij\/upload_0vHMMZ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/buQPij\/upload_0vHMMZ-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/buQPij\/upload_0vHMMZ-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/buQPij\/upload_0vHMMZ-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-09-08 20:40:16","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:16:05","locations":[{"id":"HB7F1d","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"4004 W. 96th St.","locality":"Indianapolis","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"46268","phone":"999-999-9999","website":"http:\/\/www.deviatebrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Fri:  5:00pm - 10:00pm\nSat:  12:00pm - 10:00pm\nSun:  12:00pm - 6:00pm\n\nMonday - Closed to brew\r\nTuesday - Closed to brew\r\nWednesday - Closed for now\r\nThursday - Closed for now\r\nFriday - 5 pm to 10 pm\r\nSaturday - Noon to 10 pm\r\nSunday - Noon to 6pm","latitude":39.9265355,"longitude":-86.2289472,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2015","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-09-08 20:42:35","updateDate":"2015-09-08 20:42:35","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"tfmi4K","name":"Hop Swap - Subject to Change","nameDisplay":"Hop Swap - Subject to Change","styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/tfmi4K\/upload_5MdH5e-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/tfmi4K\/upload_5MdH5e-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/tfmi4K\/upload_5MdH5e-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-05-27 15:58:38","updateDate":"2015-12-17 13:56:15","style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.
