Thus, Harvest Moon Brewing set up operations in Belt, a rural community located 20 miles southeast of Great Falls.  Harvest Moon's first batches were available in late 1997.  Soon after, the brewery developed a reputation for a well-balanced, full-bodied beer that only quality ingredients in perfect amounts could produce.  The barley is grown and malted just a few miles from the brewery while the malted wheat and hops come from the Northwest. \r\n\r\nThe brewery uses modern, state-of-the-art brewing equipment but is still a \"hands-on\" system, which allows brewery owners Stan and John to ensure high production quality.  They oversee every step of the process, from malt handling to mashing, from wort transfer to yeast pitching, from fermentation to conditioning, and from packaging to shipping.  The fine attention to detail assures consistency of production and ultimately a great-tasting craft beer!Belt, Montana, is located 15 minutes southeast of Great Falls, and is home to about 700 fantastic Montanans. Harvest Moon Brewing Company calls Belt home and has named their wheat, Belgian-style ale, Beltian White, after the town.\r\n\r\nBelt is also strategically located above one of the purest sources of water. Wells tap into the Madison Formation where constant year-round temperature and quality allow Harvest Moon to use some of the most perfect water on Earth to brew beer.\r\n\r\nAnother great thing about Belt? They are located in the center of our great state, right in the middle of the grain-growers that supply our brewery with prime barley & wheat. Harvest Moon\u2019s ties to the farming community don\u2019t end there\u2026after we use the grains, we supply the spent mash to a local pig farmer to feed his hogs. Hence the name, Pigs Ass Porter.

At the foot of the Mesa, we stand, Kannah Creek Brewing Company, where we turn this pure, untouched snowmelt into award winning classic American craft ale.\r\n\r\nSince 2005 Kannah Creek has been turning the finest ingredients and a privileged water source into amazing craft ale with a focus on quality and tradition.  With several awards to our name and a town full of friends we found demand soaring, and our 7 barrel system couldn't keep up. We have expanded into a 12,000 sq. ft., state of the art 30 barrel production facility, Edgewater, in South Downtown, Grand Junction, Colorado.","website":"http:\/\/kannahcreekbrewingco.com\/","established":"2005","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/d9U8Mi\/upload_fXOwnT-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/d9U8Mi\/upload_fXOwnT-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/d9U8Mi\/upload_fXOwnT-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/d9U8Mi\/upload_fXOwnT-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/d9U8Mi\/upload_fXOwnT-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:59","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:08:12","locations":[{"id":"eyYenc","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1960 N. 12th Street","locality":"Grand Junction","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"81501","phone":"970-263-0111","website":"http:\/\/kannahcreekbrewingco.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"SUN - THURS 11AM - 10PM\r\nFRI - SAT 11AM - 11PM\r\nPhone: 970-263-0111","latitude":39.085288,"longitude":-108.5522844,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2005","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:59","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"x2mRcs","name":"Edgewater Brewery","streetAddress":"905 Struthers Ave.","locality":"Grand Junction","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"81501","phone":"(970) 243-3659","hoursOfOperation":"Sunday-Thursday 11am-10pm \r\nFriday & Saturday 11am-11pm","latitude":39.055173,"longitude":-108.557323,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-05-19 16:13:13","updateDate":"2016-05-19 16:13:13","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"AZWOFe","name":"Pile O' Dirt Porter","nameDisplay":"Pile O' Dirt Porter","description":"This robust porter is black in color, is medium-bodied and has a rich, roasted malt flavor ending with a pleasing hop flavor and mild hop bitterness.","glasswareId":5,"availableId":1,"styleId":18,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/AZWOFe\/upload_q3s0QU-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/AZWOFe\/upload_q3s0QU-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/AZWOFe\/upload_q3s0QU-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:57","updateDate":"2015-12-16 13:36:37","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":18,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Brown Porter","shortName":"Brown Porter","description":"Brown porters are mid to dark brown (may have red tint) in color.
