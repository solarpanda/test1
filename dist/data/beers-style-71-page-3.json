With notes of biscuit, caramel, toffee, as well as tangerine, peach, nutmeg, clove and allspice. We lagered (well, guarded, actually) this ale for weeks until it was perfect. It's remarkably smooth on the palate and although it has a dry finish, it has a lingering spicy aftertaste that invites you to take another sip.","abv":"7.5","styleId":71,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/tOMZqn\/upload_0QiTj7-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/tOMZqn\/upload_0QiTj7-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/tOMZqn\/upload_0QiTj7-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-10-14 18:58:36","updateDate":"2015-12-17 18:54:37","style":{"id":71,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"French-Style Bi\u00e8re de Garde","shortName":"Bi\u00e8re de Garde","description":"Beers in this category are golden to deep copper or light brown in color.

Unfortunately due to laws in Texas we can't tell you where you can buy our beers, but we are working at trying to get them to as many of your favorite craft beer establishments as possible.","website":"http:\/\/www.southernstarbrewery.com\/","established":"2008","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Kp22MO\/upload_JAS2H1-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Kp22MO\/upload_JAS2H1-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Kp22MO\/upload_JAS2H1-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Kp22MO\/upload_JAS2H1-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Kp22MO\/upload_JAS2H1-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:58:37","locations":[{"id":"Yr1UcD","name":"Southern Star Brewing Company","streetAddress":"3525 N Frazier","locality":"Conroe","region":"Texas","postalCode":"77303","phone":"936-441-2739","website":"http:\/\/www.southernstarbrewery.com\/","latitude":30.3585757,"longitude":-95.4741966,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2008","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2016-06-23 18:45:56","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"neFESU","name":"Le Pianiste Ale","nameDisplay":"Le Pianiste Ale","description":"The second in a three-part series of jazz-inspired interpretations on the French Biere de Garde style, Le Pianiste starts as a malt forward beer, combining biscuity, breadcrust notes with a light caramel flavor.

The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery. Goose Island beers are now enjoyed in all 50 states and Europe.","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:46:51","locations":[{"id":"S2n5TB","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1800 West Fulton Street","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60612","phone":"1-800-466-7363","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","latitude":41.887107,"longitude":-87.6720969,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:33:51","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"D2gG2C","name":"Clybourn","streetAddress":"1800 North Clybourn Avenue","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60614","phone":"800-466-7363","latitude":41.9137242,"longitude":-87.65373,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1988","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:32:55","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"CSsQ5i","name":"Operation Quicksilver","nameDisplay":"Operation Quicksilver","description":"A caramel forward Biere de Garde  with dark fruit notes.","abv":"7.9","ibu":"23","styleId":71,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-11-03 15:06:43","updateDate":"2015-04-27 16:05:51","style":{"id":71,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"French-Style Bi\u00e8re de Garde","shortName":"Bi\u00e8re de Garde","description":"Beers in this category are golden to deep copper or light brown in color.

In search of a calmer life and an even better beer, Jeff turned his passion for brewing into a career. After a temporary stint at Northern Brewer and a job as an assistant brewer at Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery, Flat Earth opened in Saint Paul and set out to create beers not normally found in the upper Midwest. Flat Earth's distinctive brews are often inspired by the couple's travels and time spent in conversation with family and friends. The company's brewing on the edge philosophy is reflected in its stylish interpretation of traditional brewing assumptions. Today, Flat Earth Brewing produces a variety of artisan ales and lagers every month. As the beers roll out of the brewery, you're sure to see a theme develop around their names  a hint of conspiracy, perhaps. The names are meant to get people thinking and talking. Whether you enjoy Flat Earth beers at home or out with friends, there are no secrets when it comes to good beer.","website":"http:\/\/flatearthbrewing.com\/","established":"2007","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/AulWoF\/upload_iM4ovC-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/AulWoF\/upload_iM4ovC-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/AulWoF\/upload_iM4ovC-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/AulWoF\/upload_iM4ovC-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/AulWoF\/upload_iM4ovC-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:45:56","locations":[{"id":"6gpvgZ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2035 Benson Avenue","locality":"St. Paul","region":"Minnesota","postalCode":"55116","website":"http:\/\/flatearthbrewing.com\/","latitude":44.9084187,"longitude":-93.1538067,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"LNr16q","name":"Hamm's Building","streetAddress":"688 Minnehaha Avenue East","locality":"Saint Paul","region":"Minnesota","postalCode":"55106","phone":"(651) 698-1945","website":"http:\/\/www.flatearthbrewing.com","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Sat: 12:00 pm - 6:30 pm","latitude":44.9629992,"longitude":-93.0716823,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-05-23 13:42:34","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"njCCmB","name":"Patina","nameDisplay":"Patina","description":"Traditional, malt forward with toasted oat and caramel aroma, full body with sweet hints of toffee and bready grains \u2013 true to style, and quite the sturdy offering.","abv":"7.6","ibu":"22","styleId":71,"isOrganic":"Y","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-07-29 19:13:16","updateDate":"2015-07-29 19:13:16","style":{"id":71,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"French-Style Bi\u00e8re de Garde","shortName":"Bi\u00e8re de Garde","description":"Beers in this category are golden to deep copper or light brown in color.

The results are craft beers that are approachable and distinctive, to be enjoyed by craft beer novices and enthusiasts alike.\r\n\r\nWe invite you to experience Miner Brewing for yourself, as we open our Tap Room in Hill City this fall 2013.

Carefully pour it into your favorite glass.\r\n\r\nCitrusy, hoppy and spicy with some sweetness in the aroma, while being dry and effervescent on the tongue.

In 2003 Skip and Phin purchased the defunct Old Saddle Back Brewing Co. in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. All the equipment was removed and brought back to Lakewood, New York and set up at its new 10,000 square foot home, The Southern Tier Brewing Company. The Brewery began operations in February 2004 distributing regionally. By 2005 sales covered the majority of the New York State and the eastern half of Pennsylvania. In the beginning their two Flagship brands were a Pilsner and Mild Ale. Oh yeah they also brewed IPA! As it turned out the flagships were a flop and the IPA was a huge success. They next launched a line of seasonal beers which have gained great success. Since the beginning, Southern Tier has experienced steady growth, currently distributing to over 25% of the United States. Multiple expansions have been made to keep up with demand and the brewery continues to be innovative by producing new products.
