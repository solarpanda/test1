We knew what we wanted to drink, but we needed some help actually brewing it. So we enlisted our first brewer, took over some warehouse space on the Boston waterfront, and began introducing fresh, local craft beer to Boston drinkers. We tried to do it in a way that captured the spirit of fun that had brought us to beer in the first place. From that warehouse, surrounded by fish companies on the docks of South Boston (neighboring what is now the Seaport District), we couldn\u2019t imagine that craft brewing would become what it has today.  \r\n\r\nWe still remember our days on the other side of the bar, and have spent as much time spreading the joy of beer drinking as we have focusing on recipes, ingredients, and brewing equipment. Hopefully our sense of gratitude is reflected in both the quality of the beer and the spirit of fun and enjoyment surrounding our beer and breweries. We invite all of you to visit our Boston brewery, where it all began, and our beautiful brewery in Windsor, Vermont.","website":"http:\/\/www.harpoonbrewery.com\/","established":"1986","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/RzvedX\/upload_AbOUmA-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/RzvedX\/upload_AbOUmA-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/RzvedX\/upload_AbOUmA-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/RzvedX\/upload_AbOUmA-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/RzvedX\/upload_AbOUmA-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:57","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:47:47","locations":[{"id":"AGRvvY","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"336 Ruth Carney Drive","locality":"Windsor","region":"Vermont","postalCode":"05089","phone":"802-674-5491","website":"http:\/\/www.harpoonbrewery.com\/","latitude":43.5130201,"longitude":-72.4016913,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1986","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:57","updateDate":"2014-10-06 15:45:55","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"9aSjFg","name":"Boston","streetAddress":"306 Northern Avenue","locality":"Boston","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"02210","phone":"1-888-HARPOON","website":"http:\/\/www.harpoonbrewery.com","latitude":42.3465,"longitude":-71.033843,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1986","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2014-09-26 14:01:43","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"yPP2CX","name":"1791 Belgian Stout","nameDisplay":"1791 Belgian Stout","description":"Chocolatey roast of a stout that blends into the fruity esters of a Belgian.

They embarked on a research road trip to the \u201cbeer capitol,\u201d Denver, Colorado, for some inspiration. There, they developed the vision of Prairie Sun Brewery.\r\n\r\nAfter 19 months their vision became a reality as they took their passion and hard work, and brewed their first batch of beer on a 10-barrel system.

In May 2013, Heather and Cameron found the perfect home at the former \u201cSaskatoon Bakery\u201d and they moved in! By June 2015, Prairie Sun had grown to 12 employees and could be found in many restaurants around Saskatoon.

The brewing began in a small apartment kitchen on Pine St. in San Francisco on a stove that could hardly generate a boil. During the first night, it became apparent that we could create the beer that we wanted to drink and the collective that became Pine Street Brewery (PSB) was born. That was goal from the first night of brewing\u2014it was love at first smell.\r\n\r\nPSB moved into the historic Bourne Mansion in Pacific Heights during the Spring of 2010 and called this home until the Fall of 2011. Regular weekly brewing led to lots of experimentation and ten recipes that have become part of the core beer list. During \u201cBrew Nights,\u201d friends were made, a community was fostered and a brand was started.\r\n\r\nPine Street Brewery was designed so that our products would be available for many different palates in many different communities. There is a unique Pine Street in almost every area. We intend for our beer, interpretations of classic styles, to unite people across the US, one beer at a time.\r\n\r\nOur philosophy is to provide a celebration through ales and togetherness. We are active in the community through volunteer work and partnerships with local charities.","website":"http:\/\/www.pinestreetbrewery.com\/","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/XSfRBX\/upload_nDCINX-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/XSfRBX\/upload_nDCINX-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/XSfRBX\/upload_nDCINX-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/XSfRBX\/upload_nDCINX-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/XSfRBX\/upload_nDCINX-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:05","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:25:07","locations":[{"id":"EhUsAz","name":"Main Brewery","locality":"San Francisco","region":"California","postalCode":"94108","phone":"415-744-4062","latitude":37.79179,"longitude":-122.407419,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"Y","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:05","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"zESK83","name":"Black Gold","nameDisplay":"Black Gold","abv":"7.2","ibu":"48","styleId":44,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-11-11 01:01:35","updateDate":"2015-11-11 16:22:47","style":{"id":44,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Specialty Stouts","shortName":"Stout","description":"See British Origin American-Style Imperial Porter Imperial porters are very dark brown to black in color.
