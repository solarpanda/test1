A classic M\u00fcnchner Dunkel should have chocolate-like, roast malt, bread-like or biscuit-like aroma that comes from the use of Munich dark malt. Chocolate or roast malts can be used, but the percentage used should be minimal. Noble-type hop flavor and aroma should be low but perceptible. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Ale-like fruity esters and chill haze should not be perceived.","ibuMin":"16","ibuMax":"25","abvMin":"4.5","abvMax":"5","srmMin":"15","srmMax":"20","ogMin":"1.048","fgMin":"1.014","fgMax":"1.018","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:37:08"},"breweries":[{"id":"YAKFea","name":"Brauerei F\u00e4ssla","nameShortDisplay":"Brauerei F\u00e4ssla","website":"http:\/\/www.faessla.de\/","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:48","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:41:05","locations":[{"id":"i97npY","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Obere Knigsstrae 19-21","locality":"Bamberg","region":"Bayern","phone":"49-(0)951-\/-26516","latitude":49.89723,"longitude":10.89279,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:48","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
