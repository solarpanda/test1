They devised a plan to build a brewery in beautiful Birmingham \u2013 Alabama.\r\n\r\nThe group found an excellent location for the brewery in the Pepper Place\/Lakeview district of Birmingham on 3rd Avenue South.  The 8000 Square foot building houses the brewery and tasting room.  The building was selected for it\u2019s location, layout, and opportunity for expansion.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning, Cahaba Brewing Company has had the goal of providing Birmingham with clean and consistent craft beers with a broad variety flavors and styles.  To do this, CBC hand selected and assembled the brewing equipment necessary for the job.  As luck would have it, our friends at Straight To Ale, in Huntsville, AL were in the process of upgrading their brewery and they had just purchased all of the equipment from Old Town Brewery.  After purchasing their equipment, we were just about ready to go.  The set-up consists of a Premier Stainless 3.5 bbl brewhouse outfitted with four 7 bbl fermenters and two 7 bbl brite tanks.\r\n\r\nCahaba continued to grow and found a new location to begin the expansion process in early 2015. Celebrating \"Last Pint Night\" at the original 3rd Ave South location in mid-January 2016, the new 51,000 square foot building, located in the Historical Continental Gin, is ready to open. First day to officially open was January 19th, 2016. Not only is the space much larger, the production facility is also expanding from a 3.5 bbl brewhouse to a 30 bbl brewhouse. The new set up consists of three 60 bbl brite tanks and one 120 bbl brite tank. In addition, the 3.5 bbl system from the original building will join the larger tanks at the new facility and will be used for smaller batches. Cahaba will also begin canning various styles of beer in-house. These cans will join the already launched American Blonde that went into the local market in early 2015. The new taproom offers a window looking into the production facility, a covered patio, and ample parking. The space is also flexible, offering multiple options for all varieties of private event needs such as weddings, reunions, corporate events, and birthday parties.","website":"http:\/\/cahababrewing.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/63i9qL\/upload_D2X7RV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/63i9qL\/upload_D2X7RV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/63i9qL\/upload_D2X7RV-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/63i9qL\/upload_D2X7RV-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/63i9qL\/upload_D2X7RV-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-07-21 22:45:16","updateDate":"2016-02-02 17:39:14","locations":[{"id":"hMvwjg","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"4500 5th Ave South","extendedAddress":"Building C","locality":"Birmingham","region":"Alabama","postalCode":"35222","phone":"205-578-2616","website":"http:\/\/cahababrewing.com\/","latitude":33.526729,"longitude":-86.764854,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-07-21 22:46:42","updateDate":"2016-02-02 17:43:17","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"NGSRHv","name":"Centennial Jack Pale Ale","nameDisplay":"Centennial Jack Pale Ale","description":"Brewed in honor of Humboldt State University\u2019s 100th anniversary, we decided the best way to pay homage was to use 100% Centennial hops in a sessionable pale ale!

The Bethlehem Steel plant had been shutting down slowly for years \u2013 a dying industrial giant of a bygone day \u2013 and the region was suffering the loss hard. The downtown had also been bled by the malls and box stores that promised savings to the consumer in exchange for genuine local culture and community. Yet on April 15th, 1998, the same day the the historic Hotel Bethlehem declared bankruptcy and closed, the Bethlehem Brew Works optimistically opened its doors to the public at the corner of Main and Broad Streets. The one other restaurant in the neighborhood closed the following week.\r\n\r\nBethlehem Brew Works chose to ignore the public exodus, and instead celebrated the history of \u2018Steel\u2019 and paid tribute to the region\u2019s working class culture in it\u2019s decor and menu. The Fegley\u2019s believed a transformation was already well underway, and would grow with the city as it came to life. Over the course of a dozen years, the family became more involved in the community, and worked with the downtown shop owners to strengthen the downtown. One by one, new restaurants began open, and stores began to keep longer hours to accommodate the growing crowds. Historic Bethlehem now is home to a burgeoning restaurant row and retail shops of all kinds.\r\n2002\r\n\r\nMost importantly, the restaurant and brewery grew as well. The Steelgaarden lounge was added, and quickly became a Valley hotspot, and a few years later, the lounge exanded again, annexing another two shop spaces for more nightlife and event space. The kitchen also tripled in size with new space, and the brewery added additional tanks to keep up with the demand for the brews.\r\n2005\r\n\r\nWith an eye still on things to come, the family looked west into Allentown. Opportunity was difficult to see in a city who\u2019s retail heyday had ended some years before with the departure of Hess\u2019s department store. But the optimistic Fegleys became smitten with the history of the \u201cQueen city\u201d \u2013 from it\u2019s role in the War of Independence, to the great silk industry that supplied the world\u2019s fashions, and the great retail era the followed. \u201cThe All-American City\u201d as it was known, seemed to be frosted over \u2013 and the Fegleys believed it was about to thaw.\r\n2007\r\n\r\nIn June 2007, years in the making, the Allentown Brew Works opened on Hamilton Street, housed inside the historic Harold\u2019s Furniture Building. Proud to be part of another resurging downtown, the 400 seat restaurant is a testament to the vibrant heartbeat that thrives in the city. Offering two and a half levels of dining, plus state-of-the-art banquet facilities in The Hamilton Room, and multiple bars offering different atmospheres, as well as an outdoor casual patio, Der Biergarten and a new seductive lower level lounge, Silk. The 15-barrel brewery in the Allentown location boasts seven fermentation tanks and eight serving tanks \u2013 built with capacity to add a bottling line and begin outside sales of Fegley\u2019s Brew Works in earnest.\r\n2008\r\n\r\nIn 2008, the Philadelphia Phillies AAA team, the Iron Pigs, opened the new Coca-Cola Park stadium, and added Fegley\u2019s Brew Works to its lineup. With that account in place, and a new sales team behind the brewery sales, Fegley\u2019s Brew Works can now be found at almost 200 locations in the region from Harrisburg to central New Jersey, north to Scranton, and south to Philadelphia where it is very popular.\r\n2010\r\n\r\nOne of the nation\u2019s leading beer writers and co-founder of Philly Beer Week, Don Russell (aka Joe Sixpack), named Hop\u2019Solutely the Beer of the Year.\r\n\r\nBecoming supportive and active in the Allentown community, during their first few years the Brew Works saw eateries come and go. In 2010, the tide seemed to change with major restaurants adding to the draw of the city. For some time, the Fegleys had been constantly thinking up good ideas that they would love to see happen in the neighborhood, when it finally struck them that they should just do it themselves. In an effort to continue to move the Fegley brand toward healthy, sustainable \u201cgreen\u201d practices, they chose concepts that would fit that ideal.\r\n2011 to Present\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Fegley\u2019s brewery continues to be recognized as their Arctic Alchemy wins it\u2019s first bronze medal at the Great American Beer Festival and Blueberry Belch wins \u201cBest Summer Beer\u201d at the Philadelphia Summer Ale Festival at the Philadelphia Zoo .

Rogue's first brewpub was located in Ashland, Oregon and was a 10bbl brewsystem. Rogue opened a second brewpub, 15bbl brewsystem, in May 1989 located in Newport, Oregon. Rogue closed its Ashland operation in 1997, after the great flood destroyed the place. In 1991, the 15bbl system, named Howard after John Maier's former boss, from the Newport brewpub was transferred across the bay to the current brewery and upgraded to a 30bbl system. In 1998 Rogue bought a 50bbl brewsystem, named Kobe. Kobe is the only brewsystem in use. Tours: We offer brewery tours every day at 3 pm (followed by a distillery tour at 4pm). Go up to the bar inside the brewery (Brewers on the Bay) and check in with the bartender and the tour will commence. Please call ahead if you have a large group and or to verify the tour time...Brewer's on the Bay phone is 541-867-3664.

Rogue's first brewpub was located in Ashland, Oregon and was a 10bbl brewsystem. Rogue opened a second brewpub, 15bbl brewsystem, in May 1989 located in Newport, Oregon. Rogue closed its Ashland operation in 1997, after the great flood destroyed the place. In 1991, the 15bbl system, named Howard after John Maier's former boss, from the Newport brewpub was transferred across the bay to the current brewery and upgraded to a 30bbl system. In 1998 Rogue bought a 50bbl brewsystem, named Kobe. Kobe is the only brewsystem in use. Tours: We offer brewery tours every day at 3 pm (followed by a distillery tour at 4pm). Go up to the bar inside the brewery (Brewers on the Bay) and check in with the bartender and the tour will commence. Please call ahead if you have a large group and or to verify the tour time...Brewer's on the Bay phone is 541-867-3664. The view from Brewers on the Bay includes the marina (outside), and the bottling line and brew kettles

Not this time around.\r\n \r\nA brewer slowly climbed from the lowest points of business life with a sore ass, as he ascended to a new level. Hark! The horse of the dark nature holds the scales where the wheat and barley feedeth, not taketh from the mouths of man. A non-filtered view of hard work, careful perseverance of expansion, sticking to what is believed to be the right way and the only way to stay true to high quality, and also, the vague understandings of possible humor; blurring his family\u2019s, employees\u2019 and customers\u2019 drinking experience and vision between a no-bullshit approach to brewing big, outstanding beers and selling nonsensical imagery and haberdashery\u2026Proven to the masses as a Darkhorse trademark for the man behind the reigns.\r\n \r\nCan true patrons of quality, time and devotion deal with the inner workings of a mad-man\u2019s psyche as he speaks of visions of smacking Umpa Lumpas with snow shovels, or allows the obscure drawings of lawn jarts and tinker toys to be hung on the walls of his establishment?

Should we take turns consuming garage sale items and vomiting them on the walls or should we follow the square, straight and narrow? Slip into the pub and look around. Go out and buy a six-pack, and read the holder the beer comes in. Read the back of your growler. When you\u2019re done, you\u2019ll either get it or you won\u2019t.

This process implies that a natural sediment may remain in the bottle. This sediment can easily be consumed, but if an aesthetic beer experience is desired, pour the beer gently into the glass without the sediment.

After Homebrewing for several years, we've decided to expand to our new location (2667 Kirkwood Highway - Newark, DE) and install a 1.5 barrel brewery, making us the smallest brewery in the state of Delaware. We brew beers to please all kinds, including an Amber Ale, Rye Stout and an IPA that recently won a ribbon at the Delaware State Fair Battle of the Brews.\r\n\r\nSince we're so small, we'll be sure to experiment with several different styles of beer, so there will always be something new to check out.  Along with the beer, we'll have the same great pizzas we've been serving up for over 33 years. We'll also have soups, salads, pub sandwiches and select entrees. Also be on the lookout for our occasional beer dinners and pizza beer dinners.   We're just as passionate about our food as we are about our beer.","website":"http:\/\/www.argillabrewing.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/XF4JJ4\/upload_vFtibG-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/XF4JJ4\/upload_vFtibG-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/XF4JJ4\/upload_vFtibG-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/XF4JJ4\/upload_vFtibG-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/XF4JJ4\/upload_vFtibG-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-13 12:48:16","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:36:38","locations":[{"id":"JvRho3","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2667 Kirkwood Highway","locality":"Newark","region":"Delaware","postalCode":"19711","phone":"(302)731-8200","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  11:00am - 1:00am\nTue:  11:00am - 1:00am\nWed:  11:00am - 1:00am\nThu:  11:00am - 1:00am\nFri:  11:00am - 1:00am\nSat:  11:00am - 1:00am\nSun:  11:00am - 1:00am\n\n11am-1am 7 days a week","latitude":39.7082968,"longitude":-75.6844023,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-13 12:49:57","updateDate":"2014-09-29 20:33:30","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"ukaWQC","name":"Citra","nameDisplay":"Citra","description":"A light refreshing beer with pungent grapefruit, lychee and gooseberry aromas leading to a dry, bitter finish.","abv":"4.2","availableId":1,"styleId":25,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/ukaWQC\/upload_EbGiox-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/ukaWQC\/upload_EbGiox-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/ukaWQC\/upload_EbGiox-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-03-21 16:01:18","updateDate":"2015-12-17 02:51:36","available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":25,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"American Pale","description":"American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.
