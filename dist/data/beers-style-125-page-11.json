Mary\u2019s Maple Porter is a rich, dark ale featuring a large portion of her maple syrup in the kettle.

It was part of the nominated drinks list for the G8 Summit 2005 at Gleneagles Hotel.\r\n\r\nThe business is, since 2008, family owned following a management buy-out from its original part-owners, William Grant and Sons.\r\n\r\nTheir Innis & Gunn Original beer is brewed in Dunbar, East Lothian before being matured in American white oak Bourbon barrels for 30 days and is then a further 47 days in a marrying tun, and so it is matured for 77 days in total. It is 6.6% alcohol by volume. At first only available as a bottled beer it is now marketed both in bottles and as draught.\r\n\r\nAccording to Innis and Gunn's website, the process was discovered in an ironic accident: the intent was to create a scotch whisky with ale flavours. To do this, a special beer was created which would then be stored in the whisky barrels. After the beer had conditioned the barrels, it was to be discarded and replaced with the whisky. The brewers noted that the process had an agreeable effect on the beer, and thus aging the beer became an end in itself.\r\n\r\nA \"blonde\" version of Innis & Gunn is also widely available, and a limited edition matured in rum barrels was produced.","website":"http:\/\/www.innisandgunn.com\/","established":"2003","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jC0TAa\/upload_HlQFKB-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jC0TAa\/upload_HlQFKB-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jC0TAa\/upload_HlQFKB-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jC0TAa\/upload_HlQFKB-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jC0TAa\/upload_HlQFKB-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-03 00:34:11","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:30:32","locations":[{"id":"0HAazs","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"6 Randolph Crescent","region":"Edinburgh","postalCode":"EH3 7TH","phone":"+44 (0) 131 337 4420","website":"http:\/\/www.innisandgunn.com\/","latitude":55.951976,"longitude":-3.211095,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"GB","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-03 12:39:07","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"GB","name":"UNITED KINGDOM","displayName":"United Kingdom","isoThree":"GBR","numberCode":826,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"fHseLN","name":"Messing","nameDisplay":"Messing","styleId":125,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:41","updateDate":"2015-05-28 21:17:14","style":{"id":125,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Specialty Beer","shortName":"Specialty","description":"These beers are brewed using unusual fermentable sugars, grains and starches that contribute to alcohol content other than, or in addition to, malted barley.

Our vision is similar to many of our favorite craft brewing mentors who have inspired us to open our own brewery: We strive to brew flavorful, unfiltered, quality craft beers for distribution in the Charlotte, NC area.  \r\n \r\nWe are located in NoDa at 26th & North Davidson and we started retail distribution and tap room sales in December 2011.  Our goal is to create outstanding beer, to have a low impact on the environment, and to create personal relationships and ties to the local community. \r\n \r\nOur inspiration comes from the popular and innovative styles of the West Coast brewers and is fueled by Conor's Passion and ability to construct unique yet sessionable recipes.  We're excited to add to the growing craft beer movement in Charlotte and the Carolinas.","website":"http:\/\/birdsongbrewing.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/2U69bM\/upload_rfdNWV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/2U69bM\/upload_rfdNWV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/2U69bM\/upload_rfdNWV-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/2U69bM\/upload_rfdNWV-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/2U69bM\/upload_rfdNWV-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-15 22:52:52","updateDate":"2016-06-24 19:40:46","locations":[{"id":"8Zxhza","name":"Tap Room","streetAddress":"1016 N.

And why not collaborate on an amazing donut to base the beer upon? Bacon was clearly a place to start, vanilla custard seemed a natural next move and then, we zigged, we zagged and landed on a glaze for the ages... Root Beer. That's right, bitches. And if anyone can pull off that mind-bending delicacy, it's those broads. We rose to the challenge with the creation of a Root Beer Donut Rauchbier. First, we smoked the hell outta some Pale malt with Birch, Maple and Oak woods for a touch of pig and spice. Munich malts impart a doughy character in addition to some delicious Hi-Five Donuts in the mash. Lactose, Brown Sugar and a gallon of their vanilla glaze in the boil ensure a flaky sweetness. Add to that a proprietary blend of spice in the boil and smoked vanilla in the fermenter and you've got yourself one mouthful of a shockingly easy-drinking beer.

He found the perfect spot in Charlottesville, VA \u2013 an historic storefront on Main Street that was once home to the state of Virginia\u2019s first craft brewing operation. In September 1999, Starr Hill Brewery was founded. Named after the local neighborhood, the brewery shared its space with the legendary Starr Hill Music Hall. Since then Starr Hill's delicious craft beers have become a favorite to visiting beer lovers, musicians, and music fans from around the world.\r\n\r\nIn response to the growing demand, Starr Hill moved from this small operation to a larger facility several miles outside of town in 2005. The brewery and tap room are still based in Crozet, nestled in the rolling foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Starr Hill's year-round, seasonal and limited-release brews are now enjoyed in bars, restaurants and music venues in the Mid Atlantic and Southeast and are also available at many grocery and convenience stores throughout the region. Among the most award-winning breweries on the East Coast, Starr Hill has won 21 Great American Beer Festival, World Beer Cup and Great British Beer Festival medals.\r\n\r\nLed by Brewmaster Robbie O'Cain, Starr Hill's team is striving to make creative and world-class beer every day.

The fruits of the buckwheat plant are like small beechnuts, which are milled to separate the edible groats from the dark brown hulls. The groats are then roasted and used more or less like a grain (a good example is Kasha).","abv":"4.8","ibu":"30","glasswareId":5,"srmId":14,"availableId":4,"styleId":125,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/YsDJeg\/upload_2cyoxd-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/YsDJeg\/upload_2cyoxd-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/YsDJeg\/upload_2cyoxd-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:44","updateDate":"2015-12-16 03:11:31","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"srm":{"id":14,"name":"14","hex":"C35900"},"available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":125,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Specialty Beer","shortName":"Specialty","description":"These beers are brewed using unusual fermentable sugars, grains and starches that contribute to alcohol content other than, or in addition to, malted barley.
