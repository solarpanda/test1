We won\u2019t be serving any food in the tap room, but you'll be welcome to bring it in with you or order delivery from one of the nearby eateries. From time to time, expect to see a food truck parked just outside the front door, where you can grab a casual bite.\r\n\r\nThe tap room will always be pouring our best known beers, but you'll always find \"pilot\" brews, too. These unique beers will be brewed in smaller quantities and will be available only here at the brewery. Something new will always be on tap.\r\n\r\nOf course, brewery tours will be offered, too.\r\n\r\nLook for \"CLB\" beer at your favorite tavern or restaurant this summer, or at a local summertime festival.

In 1886 Adam Schumacher bought the brewery and started brewing beer. In 1906, the Potosi Brewing Company was founded by Adam and his brothers Nicholas and Henry. At its peak, the Potosi Brewery had grown to be the fifth largest in Wisconsin, shipping a variety of labels including Good Old Potosi, Holiday, Garten Brau, Augsburger and others to destinations throughout the United States. In 1972 the brewery ceased operations and closed its doors.\r\n\r\nThe restoration of the Potosi Brewery began in 1995 when Gary David bought the ruined Potosi Brewery Bottling buildings. This nearly one square block of buildings had just suffered a major fire and most of the buildings were a total loss. After working three years to rebuild parts of what had been destroyed, Gary then turned his attention to the Brewery itself. Being awarded the high bid at the county auction he then enlisted the help of his friend Rick Tobin and cousin Denis David. It was the marketing genius of Denis and his wife Madonna in 1999 that brought the public on board through a community meeting. This meeting was overwhelmingly attended by the public and brought forth numerous suggestions as well as additional support. It was this gathering of the public that led to the formation of the Potosi Brewery Foundation in February of 2000.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, with restoration underway, the Potosi Brewery Foundation was selected by the American Breweriana Association to be the home to its national museum. According to Len Chylack, president of the American Breweriana Association, Potosi was selected over cities such as Milwaukee and St. Louis because of their passion for beer, brewery history and beer-making culture.","website":"http:\/\/www.potosibrewery.com\/","established":"1852","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_sKK4eq-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_sKK4eq-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_sKK4eq-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_sKK4eq-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_sKK4eq-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:14:24","locations":[{"id":"HeStKS","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"209 South Main Street","extendedAddress":"Box 177","locality":"Potosi","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"53820","phone":"608-763-4002","website":"http:\/\/www.potosibrewery.com\/","latitude":42.6716654,"longitude":-90.7271709,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1852","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Lj10uz","name":"SNAKEBITE * I.P.A.","nameDisplay":"SNAKEBITE * I.P.A.","description":"A beer designed for the craft beer drinker seeking a high intensity, yet balanced hop experience.

Brewing in a renovated dairy barn, we brew American-style farmhouse ales with German, English and Belgian influences. Water is taken from our own springs and lends to our signature flavor. Our beer is made with natural ingredients and no pretense. We've been known to throw in a few spices or fruits into our beer. Our most popular beer, Pork Slap Pale Ale is sweet and malty, brewed with fresh ginger root. Heinnieweisse is a German-style weissebier with tart citrus and banana notes. For all our hopheads, Snapperhead is an American IPA with light spicy and earthy hop flavors. And don't forget about Moo Thunder American Stout with its espresso, dark chocolate, smoky flavor.\r\nWe change up the beer on draft pretty regularly, so stop by often. You can sample all our year-round brews, plus any specialty styles we have on draft. Take a tour of our brewery and learn about the brewing process, ingredients and history. Our beer is available for sale in 6-packs or cases and don't forget to bring your growler.","website":"http:\/\/butternutsbeerandale.com\/","established":"2005","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/butternutsbeerandale.com\/emailForm.html","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/9BPs2d\/upload_opWU5V-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/9BPs2d\/upload_opWU5V-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/9BPs2d\/upload_opWU5V-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/9BPs2d\/upload_opWU5V-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/9BPs2d\/upload_opWU5V-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:11:12","locations":[{"id":"ZiwDNN","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"4021 State Highway","locality":"Garrattsville","region":"New York","postalCode":"13342","phone":"607-263-5070","website":"http:\/\/butternutsbeerandale.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Sun: 12:00 pm - 5:00 pm","latitude":42.6469262,"longitude":-75.1837216,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2005","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"dgqTAQ","name":"Snapping Turtle IPA","nameDisplay":"Snapping Turtle IPA","abv":"5.4","styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-07-05 02:16:51","updateDate":"2015-06-02 15:25:10","style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.
