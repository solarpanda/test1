His family was collecting rice from farmers as land taxes for the Mito Tokugawa family. He began his brewery with the idea of using the remaining rice stocks in the warehouse. At this time in Japan a new political movement began to reform the Tokugawa regime. Fujita Toko, one of the movement's activists, advocated an ideology to build a new organizational government with a reverence of the emperor, and his thought led to the Meiji Restoration.\r\n\r\nFujita was a close friend of Kiuchi, who named one of his sakes \"KIKUSAKARI\" as a respect to the emperor. KIKU (chrysanthemum) is a crest of the imperial household, and SAKARI means 'property'.\r\n\r\n1950's Mikio Kiuchi inherited the brewery legacy in 1950. It was the time when the sake industry flourished as the rapid growth of Japan's economy after the World War II. Although many sake breweries started mass producing low quality sake due to increased demand, Kiuchi Brewery maintained their policy of pursuing the best quality of sake with the optimum ingredients and craftsman-ship.\r\n\r\nHitachino Beer In autumn 1996, Kiuchi started beer brewing business, named the brand \"HITACHINO NEST BEER\" with unique owl character logo.\r\nOver the years, Kiuchi Brewery has gained Japan and worldwide attention by winning awards at numerous world beer competitions.\r\nIn 2000, Brew on Premises facilities has opened to introduce the Lager is the main stream in the beer industries in Japan.\r\n\r\nShochu Kiuchi Kiuchi built a Distillation facility in March, 2003. to aid with recycling and reduction of waste, beginning with the production of \"Shochu Kiuchi\" Distilled liquor made from Sakekasu (Sake lees) which is the by-product of Sake Brewing.\r\n\r\nThe wine brewing project is the latest challenge of Kiuchi Brewery. Kiuchi bought 4000 square meters of land next to the brewery for the vineyard. The grape seedlings, Merlot and Chardoney were imported from France. The vineyard produced its first crop in 2000.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, 3 tonnes of grapes were harvested producing 2000 Litres of Wine. This wine is hoped to be able to offer on a market as another prestigious Kiuchi brand in the near future...","website":"http:\/\/www.kodawari.cc\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/a2GCv8\/upload_CkHjaS-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/a2GCv8\/upload_CkHjaS-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/a2GCv8\/upload_CkHjaS-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/a2GCv8\/upload_CkHjaS-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/a2GCv8\/upload_CkHjaS-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:59","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:49:44","locations":[{"id":"01Bp2T","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1257 Kounosu","locality":"Naka-shi","region":"Ibaraki","phone":"+81 (0)29-298-0105","website":"http:\/\/www.kodawari.cc\/","latitude":36.46801,"longitude":140.475563,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"JP","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:59","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"JP","name":"JAPAN","displayName":"Japan","isoThree":"JPN","numberCode":392,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"BSbeMf","name":"Holy Moly!","nameDisplay":"Holy Moly!","abv":"9","glasswareId":5,"styleId":43,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/BSbeMf\/upload_9zeEeA-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/BSbeMf\/upload_9zeEeA-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/BSbeMf\/upload_9zeEeA-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-12-17 12:26:14","updateDate":"2015-12-17 08:52:40","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"style":{"id":43,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Imperial Stout","shortName":"American Imperial Stout","description":"Black in color, American-style imperial stouts typically have a high alcohol content.

Since then, the Central PA natives have been handcrafting world-class beers that blend traditional brewing techniques with the innovation and eclecticism of the American craft brewing movement. Today, the Hershey, PA-based brewery produces six year-round beers (Hopback Amber Ale, Troegenator Double Bock, JavaHead Stout, Tr\u00f6egs Pale Ale, DreamWeaver Wheat, and Perpetual IPA); four seasonal releases as part of the Hop Cycle series (Cultivator Helles Bock, Sunshine Pils, Hop Knife Harvest Ale, and Blizzard of Hops Winter IPA); and two limited beers (Nugget Nectar and Mad Elf Ale). \r\n\r\nIn addition to these beers, Tr\u00f6egs produces a variety of experimental, small batch beers as part of its Scratch Beer Series. These beers are available exclusively at the brewery and most are draft-only limited releases, although some popular Scratch Beers (Fresh Hop Ale, Fest Lager, etc.) are bottled for release through the General Store at the brewery. \r\n\r\nIn late 2013, Tr\u00f6egs introduced a special line of cork & cage bottle releases. The first, LaGrave, is available year-round. Master of Pumpkins was also released in 2013 and will continue with availability in the fall. Other beers such as Jovial have since followed suit. The addition of a canning line not only offers the brewery more flexibility in the way it presents its beers, but also allows Tr\u00f6egs to provide customers with more packaging options. To date, Tr\u00f6egs has released Perpetual IPA and Sunshine Pils in 12-ounce cans and Troegenator in 16-ounce cans. Plans to release other seasonal and limited beers in cans are currently in the works. \r\n\r\nThe Splinter Series is an extremely limited line of barrel-aged beers packaged in cork & cage bottles.

Since then, the Central PA natives have been handcrafting world-class beers that blend traditional brewing techniques with the innovation and eclecticism of the American craft brewing movement. Today, the Hershey, PA-based brewery produces six year-round beers (Hopback Amber Ale, Troegenator Double Bock, JavaHead Stout, Tr\u00f6egs Pale Ale, DreamWeaver Wheat, and Perpetual IPA); four seasonal releases as part of the Hop Cycle series (Cultivator Helles Bock, Sunshine Pils, Hop Knife Harvest Ale, and Blizzard of Hops Winter IPA); and two limited beers (Nugget Nectar and Mad Elf Ale). \r\n\r\nIn addition to these beers, Tr\u00f6egs produces a variety of experimental, small batch beers as part of its Scratch Beer Series. These beers are available exclusively at the brewery and most are draft-only limited releases, although some popular Scratch Beers (Fresh Hop Ale, Fest Lager, etc.) are bottled for release through the General Store at the brewery. \r\n\r\nIn late 2013, Tr\u00f6egs introduced a special line of cork & cage bottle releases. The first, LaGrave, is available year-round. Master of Pumpkins was also released in 2013 and will continue with availability in the fall. Other beers such as Jovial have since followed suit. The addition of a canning line not only offers the brewery more flexibility in the way it presents its beers, but also allows Tr\u00f6egs to provide customers with more packaging options. To date, Tr\u00f6egs has released Perpetual IPA and Sunshine Pils in 12-ounce cans and Troegenator in 16-ounce cans. Plans to release other seasonal and limited beers in cans are currently in the works. \r\n\r\nThe Splinter Series is an extremely limited line of barrel-aged beers packaged in cork & cage bottles.
