It is, however, more difficult to determine when the Framboise-Lambic appeared in the Brussels pubs.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the beer certainly was available in the beginning of the 20th century. Paul Cantillon mentions a higher number of bottles of Framboise than of Kriek in his inventory for 1909-1910. During the First World War, the fruit beers disappear from the inventory. From 1922 on, the Kriek will be produced again on a regular basis. As for the Framboise, it was produced for a short time in the thirties and disappeared from the inventory afterwards.\r\n\r\nIn 1973, a friend of mine, Willy Gigounon, delivered 150 kgs of raspberries at the brewery. The production of raspberry beers started again 40 years later.\r\n\r\nI was preparing a barrel of raspberry beer. The beer coming out of the small hole in the middle of the stave was marvelous.\r\n\r\n\"It has the colour of onion skin\", said a voice behind me.\r\nIt was Raymond Coumans.\r\nHe was admiring the colour of the raspberry lambic reflecting in the red copper of the buckets used to empty the barrels. At that time (1986), \"Raspberry-Lambic\" already was synonymous with a sweet, artificially flavoured beer. This is why we decided to distinguish our beer from the other raspberry beers. Raymond proposed to call it a ros\u00e9, dedicated not to Bacchus but to Gambrinus.\r\n\r\nThe process to make this beer is identical to the one to make Kriek. When young, the Ros\u00e9 de Gambrinus will still present its full fruity taste. Later on, the lambic taste will become dominant at the expense of the fruit taste.","abv":"5","styleId":68,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/sAmmqA\/upload_OKfGBu-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/sAmmqA\/upload_OKfGBu-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/sAmmqA\/upload_OKfGBu-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:44:06","updateDate":"2015-12-15 21:45:23","style":{"id":68,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Fruit Lambic","shortName":"Fruit Lambic","description":"These beers, also known by the names framboise, kriek, peche, cassis, etc., are characterized by fruit flavors and aromas.

We've worked hard and are incredibly proud of the many successes we've enjoyed over the years. The Boston Beer Company has been cited as one of the best companies to work for by Boston Magazine, one of the Best Entry-Level Jobs by The Princeton Review, and our beers have won more awards than any other in history. Jim has been named an \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" by Inc. Magazine. Our brewers keep amazing us with innovative new brews, including Samuel Adams Utopias and our Samuel Adams Barrel Room Collection.\r\n\r\nJim has believed from the beginning that the more you know and understand about beer, the more you'll appreciate a beer like Samuel Adams Boston Lager. To begin that mission, all new employees go through intensive training on everything from ingredients, brewing, and beer styles, to taking care of the beer once it leaves the brewery. We're all beer lovers and protectors of the beer so we're trained how to identify off flavors and how to troubleshoot the causes. The passion for beer continues with an annual homebrew competition that we all take part in.\r\n\r\nOne of our wholesalers once asked Jim why he invested so much in training his people, when ultimately they might leave. Jim smiled and replied without hesitation: \"What if I didn't train them, and they stayed?\"\r\n\r\nEach year, usually in January, everyone gathers together. One of the highlights of the meeting is the beer trivia contest. With a culture so steeped in beer education and knowledge, winning is a pretty big deal. Recently, one of the hotel bartenders who was watching as the various teams arrived in costume with music and much enthusiasm and fanfare, said, \"I've always known Samuel Adams made the best beer in America, but now I see this is the greatest company in America.\" When you look around you see that The Boston Beer Company is a team of enthusiastic people who are passionate about beer and who really love coming to work every day to provide American drinkers with the best beer possible.\r\n\r\nThe Boston Beer Company, Inc. is a publicly-traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol, SAM.","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","established":"1984","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:24:45","locations":[{"id":"DF5YsC","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"30 Germania Street","locality":"Boston","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"02130","phone":"1-800-372-1131","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","latitude":42.314449,"longitude":-71.103365,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1984","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2015-12-02 19:22:03","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"MLUbXI","name":"Cincinnati","streetAddress":"1625 Central Parkway","locality":"Cincinnati","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45214","phone":"513-412-3200","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","latitude":39.1144986,"longitude":-84.5222061,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-12 13:10:57","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"XZ6L8a","name":"Production Brewery","streetAddress":"7880 Penn Drive","locality":"Breinigsville","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"18031","latitude":40.5759622,"longitude":-75.6290377,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2007","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-11-30 20:24:56","updateDate":"2015-12-02 19:22:03","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"j8bOWO","name":"Schaerbeekse Kriek","nameDisplay":"Schaerbeekse Kriek","description":"3 Fonteinen Schaerbeekse Kriek is a special oude kriek bottling made exclusively with young lambic and wild Belgian Schaerbeekse cherries.

It starts with \u2018Donker\u2019, than \u2018Tripel\u2019, \u2018Rouge\u2019 and \u2018Blond\u2019.\r\nIn 2009, the 5th generation, Xavier Van Honsebrouck, takes over.\r\nHis first achievement is the \u2018Cuv\u00e9e du Ch\u00e2teau\u2019.\r\nIn 2012 the high exclusive Trignac follows and in 2013 Kasteel Hoppy.\r\nIn commemoration of a 100 years World War I, \u2018Passchendaele\u2019, a Belgian Top Blond, with only 5.2\u00b0 alcohol is launched in 2013. A donation is offered to the community of Zonnebeke, to contribute in the preservation of its remnants of the Great War.\r\nDue to the fast growing export, the actual brewery is almost on its full capacity. A delocalisation to a brand new castle\/brewery is scheduled for 2017.","website":"http:\/\/www.vanhonsebrouck.be","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/GNz66x\/upload_el5T6f-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/GNz66x\/upload_el5T6f-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/GNz66x\/upload_el5T6f-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/GNz66x\/upload_el5T6f-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/GNz66x\/upload_el5T6f-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:42:06","locations":[{"id":"lPPoWm","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Oostrozebekestraat 43","locality":"Ingelmunster","region":"West-Vlaanderen","phone":"32-051-33-51-60","website":"http:\/\/www.vanhonsebrouck.be\/","latitude":50.9197964,"longitude":3.259074,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"BE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"BE","name":"BELGIUM","displayName":"Belgium","isoThree":"BEL","numberCode":56,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"U83Lhv","name":"Strawberry Lambic","nameDisplay":"Strawberry Lambic","styleId":68,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/U83Lhv\/upload_gUmaGS-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/U83Lhv\/upload_gUmaGS-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/U83Lhv\/upload_gUmaGS-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-11-18 12:47:04","updateDate":"2015-12-17 07:04:50","style":{"id":68,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Fruit Lambic","shortName":"Fruit Lambic","description":"These beers, also known by the names framboise, kriek, peche, cassis, etc., are characterized by fruit flavors and aromas.
