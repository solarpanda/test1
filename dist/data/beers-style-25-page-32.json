After homebrewing on the family farm for years, homebrewer Cory Schroeder teamed up with Jim Wiesender to found the brewery in 1999.\r\n\r\nUsing equipment scrounged from various industries, such as a converted pudding tank for the brew kettle, the pair launched a successful business, brewing the beer just steps away from the chicken coop and a busy dairy farm.\r\n\r\nTheir Sand Creek Golden Ale and English Style Special Ale, available only on draft and in half-gallon growlers, soon developed a reputation throughout Wisconsin's many brew fests. With a capacity of only about 150 barrels per year, the brewery, now with a third owner on board, quickly outgrew the little farm shed converted into a brewhouse.\r\n\r\nHoping to remain in the Dunn\/St. Croix counties area, the company looked for a suitable place to relocate, but came up empty handed. Then opportunity knocked in the form of a phone call one evening from their friend in Black River Falls, Pioneer brewing's brewmaster Todd Krueger. The brewery was for sale.\r\n\r\nIn March of 2004 the combined forces of the two breweries officially formed the new Sand Creek Brewing Co. of Black River Falls, Wisconsin.","website":"http:\/\/www.sandcreekbrewing.com\/","established":"1999","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gsADrL\/upload_RPFu23-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gsADrL\/upload_RPFu23-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gsADrL\/upload_RPFu23-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gsADrL\/upload_RPFu23-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gsADrL\/upload_RPFu23-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:56:58","locations":[{"id":"TSKxwK","name":"Sand Creek Brewing Co","streetAddress":"320 Pierce St","extendedAddress":"Box 187","locality":"Black River Falls","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"54615","phone":"(715) 284-7553","website":"http:\/\/www.sandcreekbrewing.com\/","latitude":44.2830622,"longitude":-90.7913227,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1998","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2015-12-04 17:57:24","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"DfyQLd","name":"Lime 'Em Up Cuke 'Em Down","nameDisplay":"Lime 'Em Up Cuke 'Em Down","styleId":25,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-11-12 19:51:04","updateDate":"2015-11-12 19:51:36","style":{"id":25,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"American Pale","description":"American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.

So, it was a natural for us to revive the brewery that has been in Lexington since 1794.

Driven by a desire for a quality, local product that would complement and diversify the already existing pub's style and reputation, Larry and Peter knew they would have to focus on producing a high quality product if it was going to be a success.  Knowing his beer knowledge and passion for the family business in which he grew up, Larry and Peter soon brought Larry's son Andrew into the conversation.  Beginning in a consulting roll, Andrew soon decided it was time to come back into the fold and asked his father and uncle for an opportunity to rejoin the family business in a full-time position.  In the coming year as business at the pub rolled on and continued to grow, so too did the brewery project.  Moving from an idea spoken about \u201coff the clock\u201d to a plan developed in a weekly owner's meeting, Geaghan Brothers Brewing Company began to take shape.  The project received a major boost in the most unlikely of circumstances when Larry, attending a local funeral, made contact with Sarah Courtney, a woman who grew up with Larry's oldest son Thomas.  Sarah and her husband Jason had spent the past 15 years working full-time in brewpub and microbrewery settings.  Jason had progressed from homebrewer to assistant brewer to head brewer and in 2002 had a very successful showing at the Great American Beer Festival, receiving the brewpub category brewmaster of the year honors.  As Larry, Peter and Andrew continued conversations and expressed their desire to build a small-scale brewery in Bangor, Jason and Sarah also expressed their interest in moving back to the Bangor area.  In time, with many conversations and meetings, both desires began to take shape.  With many options available to them, Jason and Sarah decided an opportunity to have a foundational and long-term impact on and relationship with a truly local brewery in Bangor, Maine was exactly what they were looking for.  In December 2011 the idea became a reality.  The Geaghan Family, together with award winning brewer Jason Courtney, have begun pouring pints of locally craft brewed beer from Geaghan Brothers Brewing Company exclusively at Geaghan's Pub.","website":"http:\/\/www.geaghanspub.com","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jmyqSv\/upload_Fwpywr-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jmyqSv\/upload_Fwpywr-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jmyqSv\/upload_Fwpywr-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jmyqSv\/upload_Fwpywr-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jmyqSv\/upload_Fwpywr-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-10 18:56:21","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:42:57","locations":[{"id":"oN5ry0","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"570 Main Street","locality":"Bangor","region":"Maine","postalCode":"04401","phone":"207-945-3730","website":"http:\/\/www.geaghanspub.com","latitude":44.786998,"longitude":-68.777343,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-10 19:02:53","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Eu8QY2","name":"Lips of Faith - Biere de Mars","nameDisplay":"Lips of Faith - Biere de Mars","description":"For the first time in three years we are pleased to offer one of our favorite harbingers of spring, Biere de Mars.\r\n\r\nWith earthy tones of ripe mango and lemon verbena, this bottle-conditioned ale reflects the hearty character of the southern Belgian and northern French countrysides.

In 2003 Skip and Phin purchased the defunct Old Saddle Back Brewing Co. in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. All the equipment was removed and brought back to Lakewood, New York and set up at its new 10,000 square foot home, The Southern Tier Brewing Company. The Brewery began operations in February 2004 distributing regionally. By 2005 sales covered the majority of the New York State and the eastern half of Pennsylvania. In the beginning their two Flagship brands were a Pilsner and Mild Ale. Oh yeah they also brewed IPA! As it turned out the flagships were a flop and the IPA was a huge success. They next launched a line of seasonal beers which have gained great success. Since the beginning, Southern Tier has experienced steady growth, currently distributing to over 25% of the United States. Multiple expansions have been made to keep up with demand and the brewery continues to be innovative by producing new products.

The name Berlin is believed to be derived from a contraction of \"Burleigh Inn\", a tavern located at the crossroads of the Philadelphia Post Road (now South Main Street) and Sinepuxent Road (Tripoli Street).\r\n\r\nIt just so happens, that our building was originally a Cooperage - making oak barrels to fill with local produce and seafood to ship off to Baltimore in the early 1900's. And we are bringing barrels back to the building, aiding us in the aging of our hand-crafted ales.","website":"http:\/\/www.burleyoak.com\/","established":"2011","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/burleyoak.us8.list-manage.com\/subscribe?u=e9e9f1b229013eb1f9c176a6d&id=08ec5affe2","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:17:12","locations":[{"id":"dB9k9t","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"10016 Old Ocean City Blvd","locality":"Berlin","region":"Maryland","postalCode":"21811","phone":"410-422-8887","website":"http:\/\/www.burleyoak.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday 11am-11pm \r\nThursday, Friday, and Saturday 11am-2am\r\nSunday 12pm - 9pm","latitude":38.3338561,"longitude":-75.2169099,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"nw6a3V","name":"Local","nameDisplay":"Local","description":"This is a classic west coast style American Pale Ale.

Tim's background in brewing started in his college days at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. In early 1993, his roommate at the time introduced him to the art of making beer. This smalltime hobby of making beer in a tiny apartment blossomed into a fulltime career, brewing commercially. Towards the end of 1993, Tim attended UC Davis in Northern California to study Fermentation Science. Upon returning to Salt Lake, he aligned himself with a startup brewery called Uinta Brewing Company. The concept for this startup was to brew the freshest beer available in the State of Utah while limiting the alcohol percentage to 3.2 by weight (4% by volume). It was wildly successful, providing locally made beer for the ski areas and the many tourists that visited Utah.","website":"http:\/\/tenayacreek.com\/","established":"1999","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/MSB2i0\/upload_47A7Ot-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/MSB2i0\/upload_47A7Ot-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/MSB2i0\/upload_47A7Ot-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/MSB2i0\/upload_47A7Ot-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/MSB2i0\/upload_47A7Ot-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:59:57","locations":[{"id":"HtFqFO","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"3101 North Tenaya Way","locality":"Las Vegas","region":"Nevada","postalCode":"89128","phone":"702-362-7335","website":"http:\/\/tenayacreekbrewery.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Daily: 11:00 a.m. to 2:00 a.m.\r\nClosed on Independence Day, Thanksgiving and Christmas.","latitude":36.2161144,"longitude":-115.251306,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1999","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"gsNBhm","name":"Local Blonde","nameDisplay":"Local Blonde","abv":"4.8","ibu":"17","glasswareId":5,"availableId":1,"styleId":25,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-06-02 23:29:18","updateDate":"2015-06-09 20:11:01","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":25,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"American Pale","description":"American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.
