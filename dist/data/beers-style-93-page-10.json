The start-up of production was dedicated to the 1980 Olympic Games.\r\n\r\nCzech experts were engaged in the project as world-renowned brewmasters. They were the ones who identified the construction site for the new brewery. The choice of construction site was determined by the main factor, namely the availability of huge reserves of soft, crystal-clear water. Today, the water from Jurassic bedrock (290 m) ensures the high quality of our products.\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards, the enterprise gave the impetus to developing the largest corporation in Ukraine to produce beer, low alcohol and soft drinks, and mineral water.\r\n\r\nThe plant received its current name only in 1986, after the district of Kyiv with the same name. The word \u2018Obolon\u2019 comes from the times of Kievan Rus, when it denoted low riverside meadows.\r\n\r\nBuilt according to a Czech design, the brewery produced beer that gained wide popularity. After Ukraine became independent, Obolon was the first corporation to export hopped beverages to Europe and the USA. Obolon trademark beer started being perceived as traditional Ukrainian beer in the whole world.\r\n\r\nAfter a quarter of a century, Obolon has evolved into a world-renowned trademark.

All Samuel Smith\u2019s naturally conditioned draught beer is served from the wood. The original well at The Old Brewery, sunk in 1758, is still in use, with the brewing water being drawn from 85 feet underground.\r\n\r\nSamuel Smith\u2019s ales and stouts (except draught Sovereign and Extra Stout) are fermented in \u2018stone Yorkshire squares\u2019~ fermenting vessels made of solid slabs of slate ~ which give the beers a fuller bodied taste. \r\n\r\nThe yeast used to ferment Samuel Smith\u2019s ales has been of the same strain since the nineteenth century.  Samuel Smith\u2019s grey Shire horses are stabled behind the Angel & White Horse, the pub next to the brewery.","website":"http:\/\/www.samuelsmithsbrewery.co.uk\/","established":"1758","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/DbGzFb\/upload_jbj5YL-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/DbGzFb\/upload_jbj5YL-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/DbGzFb\/upload_jbj5YL-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/DbGzFb\/upload_jbj5YL-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/DbGzFb\/upload_jbj5YL-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:56:52","locations":[{"id":"9EHIsH","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"High Street","locality":"Tadcaster","region":"North Yorkshire","phone":"44-(01937)-839201","website":"http:\/\/www.samuelsmithsbrewery.co.uk\/","latitude":53.883845,"longitude":-1.261709,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"GB","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"GB","name":"UNITED KINGDOM","displayName":"United Kingdom","isoThree":"GBR","numberCode":826,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"5JbqEW","name":"Originaal","nameDisplay":"Originaal","description":"Saku\u2019s original pils.\r\nSaku Originaal is a light high-quality beer with a mild taste and pleasant aroma, which Saku brews of its own yeast, water, and selected malt and hops. \r\n\r\n Saku Originaal is Estonia\u2019s first on beer of the new era, which came on sale in 1993.

At Philadelphia Brewing Co we take pride in our brews, our people, and our community. One person could never do everything that it takes to get beer into your glass. And it may sound obvious, but we won't brew anything that we wouldn't drink ourselves - you won't catch us drinking anything called Ultra unless it's a literal name meaning more flavor, more hops, more malt, more carbs. That's because we are Brewers; proud brewers of fine hand crafted Ales from our historic brewery building in the Kensington neighborhood of Philadelphia. Now that's out of the way; we will be starting out with four mainstay brews which will be available in draught and in bottles. Once we're stocked up on the core brews we'll start pumping out regular seasonal or specialty brews. The specialty series will be driven by our individual brewers and the desires and whims of the rest of our family.  The beer is flowing at Philadelphia Brewing co!

They were intrigued by the thought of building his brewery, but after much discussion, they decided they wanted to build a brewery that would reflect more of themselves. They embarked on a research road trip to the \u201cbeer capitol,\u201d Denver, Colorado, for some inspiration. There, they developed the vision of Prairie Sun Brewery.\r\n\r\nAfter 19 months their vision became a reality as they took their passion and hard work, and brewed their first batch of beer on a 10-barrel system. Starting a business is no easy task\u2026starting a craft brewery is even tougher. Luckily, they were able to find most of the equipment needed to make it happen from Hogs Head Brewery in St. Albert, Alberta. In May 2013, Heather and Cameron found the perfect home at the former \u201cSaskatoon Bakery\u201d and they moved in! By June 2015, Prairie Sun had grown to 12 employees and could be found in many restaurants around Saskatoon. Heather and Cameron look forward to sharing their tasty beer with everyone in this community.","website":"http:\/\/www.prairiesun.ca\/","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/WumkFt\/upload_vUhHP7-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/WumkFt\/upload_vUhHP7-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/WumkFt\/upload_vUhHP7-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/WumkFt\/upload_vUhHP7-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/WumkFt\/upload_vUhHP7-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-04-04 04:01:42","updateDate":"2016-05-16 12:32:48","locations":[{"id":"8vBYrZ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2020 Quebec St.","locality":"Saskatoon","region":"SK","postalCode":"S7K 1W5","phone":"+1 306-343-7000","website":"www.prairiesun.ca","hoursOfOperation":"Thu:  11:00am - 7:00pm\nFri:  11:00am - 9:00pm\nSat:  11:00am - 9:00pm\nSun:  11:00am - 3:00pm\nMon:  11:00am - 7:00pm\nTue:  11:00am - 7:00pm\nWed:  11:00am - 7:00pm\n\n","latitude":52.1572444,"longitude":-106.6627988,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"CA","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-04-04 04:01:43","updateDate":"2016-05-05 16:42:52","country":{"isoCode":"CA","name":"CANADA","displayName":"Canada","isoThree":"CAN","numberCode":124,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"QesFPz","name":"Pre Prohibition Lager","nameDisplay":"Pre Prohibition Lager","description":"Brewed with 25% corn","abv":"5","ibu":"16","availableId":1,"styleId":93,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/QesFPz\/upload_IADxvt-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/QesFPz\/upload_IADxvt-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/QesFPz\/upload_IADxvt-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-08-05 20:01:15","updateDate":"2015-12-17 17:12:12","available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":93,"categoryId":8,"category":{"id":8,"name":"North American Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"American-Style Lager","shortName":"American Lager","description":"Light in body and very light to straw in color, American lagers are very clean and crisp and aggressively carbonated.
