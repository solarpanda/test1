And now, we're introducing art to our anniversary, creating a limited edition bottle design in collaboration with guru, Mike Watt.\"\r\n\r\nMike Watt is an Australian artist and illustrator based in Sydney. His mediums vary from biro, spray paint, brush and ink to digital. He describes his style as \"kind of gritty and ugly\", normally showing characters with lots of personality that have lived an interesting life.\r\n\"It's always great collaborating with Murray's. They're really into their craft and they make amazing beer. I love working with anyone who is passionate about what they do - when it's making amazing beer it makes it even better!\" said Mike Watt.\r\n\r\nMurray's Anniversary Ale is always oak aged, always big and always a very limited release of around 1000 bottles. While this year's special brew gives a nod to its roots, reflecting the original recipe brewed to launch the company on New Year's Eve nine years ago, the recipe twist is aging the beer on Hunter Valley red wine barrel staves.\r\n\r\n\"These staves will not only add flavour and aroma from the inside surfaces that have been in contact with the red wine, but will also add raw oakiness from the outside surfaces of the staves,\" said Head Brewer, Graeme Mahy. \"The end result of the staves provides a unique combination of part oaky, part red wine flavours.\"\r\n\r\nAn English-style barley wine, this year's Anniversary Ale features warming rich fruit cake-like sweetness from the caramel and roasted malts, with strong aromas of stone fruit and an assertive but balanced bitterness in the finish.\r\n\r\nThis big beer can be enjoyed now, however, we advise patience will be rewarded. Cellaring for 5-10 years (if you can) is recommended to maximise enjoyment from the maturing flavours.\r\n\r\n\"If you just can't hold out for 10 years, then try some over Christmas with a Christmas fruit pudding. Or in the New Year, with some ultra-rich and strong blue cheese,\" adds Graeme.","abv":"10","availableId":2,"styleId":17,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"Have with Blue Cheese","createDate":"2015-03-04 17:19:47","updateDate":"2015-03-04 17:19:48","available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"style":{"id":17,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"British-Style Barley Wine Ale","shortName":"British Barleywine","description":"British-style barley wines range from tawny copper to dark brown in color and have a full body and high residual malty sweetness.

The Bethlehem Steel plant had been shutting down slowly for years \u2013 a dying industrial giant of a bygone day \u2013 and the region was suffering the loss hard. The downtown had also been bled by the malls and box stores that promised savings to the consumer in exchange for genuine local culture and community. Yet on April 15th, 1998, the same day the the historic Hotel Bethlehem declared bankruptcy and closed, the Bethlehem Brew Works optimistically opened its doors to the public at the corner of Main and Broad Streets. The one other restaurant in the neighborhood closed the following week.\r\n\r\nBethlehem Brew Works chose to ignore the public exodus, and instead celebrated the history of \u2018Steel\u2019 and paid tribute to the region\u2019s working class culture in it\u2019s decor and menu. The Fegley\u2019s believed a transformation was already well underway, and would grow with the city as it came to life. Over the course of a dozen years, the family became more involved in the community, and worked with the downtown shop owners to strengthen the downtown. One by one, new restaurants began open, and stores began to keep longer hours to accommodate the growing crowds. Historic Bethlehem now is home to a burgeoning restaurant row and retail shops of all kinds.\r\n2002\r\n\r\nMost importantly, the restaurant and brewery grew as well. The Steelgaarden lounge was added, and quickly became a Valley hotspot, and a few years later, the lounge exanded again, annexing another two shop spaces for more nightlife and event space. The kitchen also tripled in size with new space, and the brewery added additional tanks to keep up with the demand for the brews.\r\n2005\r\n\r\nWith an eye still on things to come, the family looked west into Allentown. Opportunity was difficult to see in a city who\u2019s retail heyday had ended some years before with the departure of Hess\u2019s department store. But the optimistic Fegleys became smitten with the history of the \u201cQueen city\u201d \u2013 from it\u2019s role in the War of Independence, to the great silk industry that supplied the world\u2019s fashions, and the great retail era the followed. \u201cThe All-American City\u201d as it was known, seemed to be frosted over \u2013 and the Fegleys believed it was about to thaw.\r\n2007\r\n\r\nIn June 2007, years in the making, the Allentown Brew Works opened on Hamilton Street, housed inside the historic Harold\u2019s Furniture Building. Proud to be part of another resurging downtown, the 400 seat restaurant is a testament to the vibrant heartbeat that thrives in the city. Offering two and a half levels of dining, plus state-of-the-art banquet facilities in The Hamilton Room, and multiple bars offering different atmospheres, as well as an outdoor casual patio, Der Biergarten and a new seductive lower level lounge, Silk. The 15-barrel brewery in the Allentown location boasts seven fermentation tanks and eight serving tanks \u2013 built with capacity to add a bottling line and begin outside sales of Fegley\u2019s Brew Works in earnest.\r\n2008\r\n\r\nIn 2008, the Philadelphia Phillies AAA team, the Iron Pigs, opened the new Coca-Cola Park stadium, and added Fegley\u2019s Brew Works to its lineup. With that account in place, and a new sales team behind the brewery sales, Fegley\u2019s Brew Works can now be found at almost 200 locations in the region from Harrisburg to central New Jersey, north to Scranton, and south to Philadelphia where it is very popular.\r\n2010\r\n\r\nOne of the nation\u2019s leading beer writers and co-founder of Philly Beer Week, Don Russell (aka Joe Sixpack), named Hop\u2019Solutely the Beer of the Year.\r\n\r\nBecoming supportive and active in the Allentown community, during their first few years the Brew Works saw eateries come and go. In 2010, the tide seemed to change with major restaurants adding to the draw of the city. For some time, the Fegleys had been constantly thinking up good ideas that they would love to see happen in the neighborhood, when it finally struck them that they should just do it themselves. In an effort to continue to move the Fegley brand toward healthy, sustainable \u201cgreen\u201d practices, they chose concepts that would fit that ideal.\r\n2011 to Present\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Fegley\u2019s brewery continues to be recognized as their Arctic Alchemy wins it\u2019s first bronze medal at the Great American Beer Festival and Blueberry Belch wins \u201cBest Summer Beer\u201d at the Philadelphia Summer Ale Festival at the Philadelphia Zoo . Arctic Alchemy goes on to win a gold medal at GABF in 2014 and the pubs continue to win Reader\u2019s Choice Awards and Best of the Valley Awards. View our complete awards list.\r\n\r\nWith the addition of a bottling line, and the growing success of outside accounts the brewery is closing in on it\u2019s capacity, and soon Fegley\u2019s will begin to nose their way to new opportunities. Perhaps there\u2019s another fragrant wallflower ready to dance.","website":"http:\/\/www.thebrewworks.com","established":"1998","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Rx4Dnt\/upload_N2X3bi-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Rx4Dnt\/upload_N2X3bi-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Rx4Dnt\/upload_N2X3bi-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Rx4Dnt\/upload_N2X3bi-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Rx4Dnt\/upload_N2X3bi-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:38:31","locations":[{"id":"Jio9R0","name":"Fegley's Allentown Brew Works","streetAddress":"812 W Hamilton St","locality":"Allentown","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"18101","phone":"610.433.7777","website":"http:\/\/www.thebrewworks.com\/allentown-brewworks\/","latitude":40.6013531,"longitude":-75.4739451,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1998","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2015-10-21 15:03:28","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"SAPoSh","name":"Fegley's Bethlehem Brew Works","streetAddress":"569 Main Street","locality":"Bethlehem","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"18018","phone":"610-882-1300","latitude":40.6222629,"longitude":-75.3821851,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-10-21 15:03:28","updateDate":"2015-10-21 15:03:28","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"tvUf7S","name":"Barbieswine","nameDisplay":"Barbieswine","description":"Our barley wine is what would be considered an English-style barley wine.

Apparently hats tasted, because it soon emerged that there should be more than just a hobby. Toms brother Michael came into the game and the initial thinking to open a microbrewery were the end of 2007 in the room. The onetime still very amateurish plans were (from the current perspective thankfully) not implemented. The idea persisted, however. And so Tom and John went once to Weihenstephan to study at TUM brewing and beverage technology. In early 2012, the plans were revived and Raphael came on board.\r\n\r\nWe played different scenarios: Own Brewery vs. Gypsy Brewing, building the brand, and most importantly the recipe development. It quickly became apparent that the construction of their own brewing equipment from the beginning is difficult to achieve and for us the concept as Gypsy Brewer is the path to the goal. After an intensive search for a partner brewery we could start our cooperation with Reinhold Barta Brauhaus cast.
