A combination that guarantees high quality. It is quality that is the basis of Zeunerts\u2019 business. The Bavarian art of brewing is without a doubt the finest in the world. As early as 1859, Christoffer August Zeunert introduced copper vats and open fermenting tubs in production and the tradition of ageing the beer to the perfect maturity and flavour. It goes without saying that we follow the German Beer Purity Laws.\r\n\r\n ONLY FIRST-CLASS RAW MATERIALS WILL DO HERE\r\n\r\nWe are extremely careful about raw materials. The water, the most important prerequisite for a good beer, gives us a strong advantage in quality. The fresh water of the Swedish North is the best water from which to make beer. At least that was the opinion of Christoffer August Zeunert. Hops are the spice of beer. The little hop cones contain the hundreds of flavours that give beer its bitterness, flavour and aroma. All hop varieties are carefully selected to suit their particular type of brew.","website":"http:\/\/zeunerts.se\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/K6tR8d\/upload_b9R9Vn-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/K6tR8d\/upload_b9R9Vn-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/K6tR8d\/upload_b9R9Vn-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/K6tR8d\/upload_b9R9Vn-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/K6tR8d\/upload_b9R9Vn-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-12-02 16:10:22","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:01:51","locations":[{"id":"uPcCls","name":"Main Brewery","region":"Sollefte\u00e5","postalCode":"881 00","website":"http:\/\/zeunerts.se\/","isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"SE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-12-26 14:33:51","updateDate":"2014-12-26 14:33:51","country":{"isoCode":"SE","name":"SWEDEN","displayName":"Sweden","isoThree":"SWE","numberCode":752,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"MK0ftw","name":"Bumbl'n Bubbas Buzz'n Brew","nameDisplay":"Bumbl'n Bubbas Buzz'n Brew","description":"A clean low carb and low calorie ale (3.4 carbs, 96 cal.)

It all began in the 1500\u201ds. French Canadian trappers traveling west along the famous Red River Trail discovered this natural spring, which had the most refreshing water. Word of this spring spread and became a regular stop for all settlers going west on the Red River Trail. In 1857 Swiss born naturalist Armond DuPont wrote, \u201cit is a water like no other, unique in its ability to refresh.\u201d He noted, \u201cThough seemingly impossible, a year-round frost forms at the base of this amazing spring.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe brewery was built at the site of the spring and its water became the basis of all the award winning brews for over 125 years. In addition, the brewery has become the #1 energy drink and specialty drink producer in the country. We personally invite you to explore and enjoy our great water, drinks and brews.","website":"http:\/\/www.coldspringbrewery.com\/","established":"1874","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/GhJ5ei\/upload_mBDnaP-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/GhJ5ei\/upload_mBDnaP-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/GhJ5ei\/upload_mBDnaP-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/GhJ5ei\/upload_mBDnaP-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/GhJ5ei\/upload_mBDnaP-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:43:30","locations":[{"id":"czEE4b","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"219 Red River Avenue North","locality":"Cold Spring","region":"Minnesota","postalCode":"56320","phone":"320-685-8686","website":"http:\/\/www.coldspringbrewery.com\/","latitude":45.4582465,"longitude":-94.4290551,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"O7QsEH","name":"Goldmine Light Lager","nameDisplay":"Goldmine Light Lager","abv":"3.2","styleId":95,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-06-19 17:38:50","updateDate":"2014-06-19 17:38:50","style":{"id":95,"categoryId":8,"category":{"id":8,"name":"North American Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"American-Style Low-Carbohydrate Light Lager","shortName":"American Low-Carb Lager","description":"These beers are extremely light straw to light amber in color, light in body, and high in carbonation.
