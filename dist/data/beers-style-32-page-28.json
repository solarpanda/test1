Our mantra is big, bold flavors, made exactingly with natural ingredients. So, for example, if we say a beer will taste like peanut butter and jelly, you can be sure you\u2019ll smell and taste the fresh roasted peanuts and fruity berry jam. Our flagship beers such as Hop Gun IPA and Floridian Hefeweizen, also strive towards big, bold flavor. It\u2019s who we are.\r\n\r\nOur Brewery is located in the heart of Oakland Park\u2019s new Culinary Arts District. The 20,000 sq-ft facility is powered by a 30-barrel, three-piece brewhouse, which feeds nearly 1000 gallons of beer per batch into our four 60-barrel fermenters - a capacity that makes us South Florida\u2019s largest craft microbrewery. Each of our distinctive beers is brewed using the finest, all-natural ingredients, then served up unpasteurized, unfiltered, and unfussed with. We offer tours of our 20,000 sq-ft facility, rotating food trucks nightly, and growlers of our brewery fresh beer to-go.\r\n\r\nYou can sample our creations in our spacious tap room - open 7 days a week, noon to midnight - as well as in bars and restaurants all across South Florida. And of course, we still brew at our original location in Boca Raton, the Funky Buddha Brewery & Lounge, which has become a test kitchen for our more experimental brews.\r\n\r\nSee you soon for a pint!

Brewed and bottled in small batches with only honest ingredients, BarrelHouse beers are extremely fresh and exceptionally flavorful. Thank you for embracing our fiercely independent vision of a hand-crafted future for all! Operating as a brewpub from August 1995 until February 2005, The BarrelHouse Brewing Company recently relocated to our current location in the West End of downtown Cincinnati. We officially reopened with a completed expansion plan in April 2005. Our expansion included almost doubling our fermentation capacity as well as the addition of a brand new bottling line. Our first order of bottled beer hit Ohio area stores in June 2006 and we have subsequently begun to enter markets that were previously unavailable. The BarrelHouse Brewing Company brews on a 15 BBL brewhouse manufactured by Century. One BBL equals 31 gallons therefore; our beers are hand-crafted in 465 gallon batches. Our ales are ready after approximately fourteen days while our lagers are conditioned for upwards of six weeks. By brewing in small batches, our brewers are able to achieve an optimal level of quality control while creating a consistently flavorful product. While our brewing process is quite labor intensive, we believe that hand-crafting our beers sets us apart from the majority of breweries in the U.S. today. Our dedication is unparalleled and quite evident in the final packaged product.","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:45","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:39:16","locations":[{"id":"iWyq08","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"544B W.
