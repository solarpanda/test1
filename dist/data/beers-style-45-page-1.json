From the explorers of the 1700s through the Gold Rush, many a thirsty Alaskan has been able to enjoy locally made beers.\r\n\r\nIn 1986, 28-year-olds Marcy and Geoff Larson reignited that tradition when they opened the Alaskan Brewing Company, the 67th brewery in the country and the first brewery in Juneau since Prohibition. Alaskan beers reflect many of the same characteristics of beers that were brewed here during the gold rush era. From the historically based Alaskan Amber recipe to alder-smoked malts and Sitka spruce tips, Alaskan beers reflect Juneau's local brewing history and innovation.\r\n\r\nMarcy and Geoff were drawn to the beauty and adventure of Alaska, but finding a livelihood that would allow them to stay was a challenge. \"Why not start a brewery?\" a friend suggested. Other than the extreme financial and logistical challenges of brewing beer in the Last Frontier, they couldn't think of why not.\r\n\r\nMaybe the idea wasn't so far-fetched. After all, Geoff was a chemical engineer and a homebrewer and was married to Marcy, an adventure-seeking accountant and aspiring bush pilot. Together they brought a unique skill set to the task of opening a brewery in Alaska.\r\n\r\nWhile researching brewing in Alaska, Marcy unearthed shipping records from Douglas City Brewing Co. (1899-1907) that listed ingredients for its popular beers and a newspaper article that described the way it was brewed. Geoff homebrewed a batch of the Gold Rush-era brew and they could see what made it so popular. That beer is now known as Alaskan Amber.\r\n\r\nIn December 1986, Alaskan Brewing Co. officially began operations when Geoff, Marcy and 10 volunteers spent 12 hours hand packaging the first 253 cases of Alaskan Amber for distribution in Juneau, Alaska. From that very humble beginning, Alaskan Brewing Co. has grown to become the most award-winning craft brewery in the history of the Great American Beer Festival and expanded distribution to 14 states.","website":"http:\/\/www.alaskanbeer.com","established":"1986","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/VPHkaP\/upload_psVrqV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/VPHkaP\/upload_psVrqV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/VPHkaP\/upload_psVrqV-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/VPHkaP\/upload_psVrqV-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/VPHkaP\/upload_psVrqV-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:43","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:38:23","locations":[{"id":"krIs45","name":"Main Location","streetAddress":"5429 Shaune Dr","locality":"Juneau","region":"Alaska","postalCode":"99801-9540","phone":"907-780-5866","website":"http:\/\/www.alaskanbeer.com\/","latitude":58.3570171,"longitude":-134.4893459,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1986","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:43","updateDate":"2015-12-03 19:08:04","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"FnPMos","name":"All Call","nameDisplay":"All Call","description":"If you stop by our taproom, chances are you'll run into the law.

We are committed to the continued growth and revitalization of our neighborhood by being an interactive and supportive partner to the arts and business communities, as well as the burgeoning craft beer movement in Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nAngel City Brewing was founded in 1997. Starting modestly, Angel City quickly became a leader in the LA craft beer scene. In 2004 Angel City bought an 8,000 barrel German-made brewery in Alpine Village near Los Angeles on EBay! and lovingly restored the facility. In late 2010, Angel City relocated the brewery to the historic John A. Roebling Building in LA\u2019s Downtown Arts District. The vision was, and remains, to give this great city a great brewery.\r\n\r\nOn January 5, 2012, Angel City Brewery was acquired by Alchemy & Science, a craft beer collaboration led by Alan Newman and Stacey Steinmetz, formerly of Magic Hat Brewing Company.\r\n\r\nSince January 2012, we\u2019ve undergone massive renovations, including the addition of a new mustache bar. We began brewing in April of 2012, and started popping up in local LA bars and restaurants soon thereafter.\r\n\r\nIn February 2013, we opened the doors to the Brewery and Public House, but with limited hours as construction continued. We offer an ever-rotating selection of Angel City beer on tap, which includes a number of beers exclusively available at the Brewery. In addition to pints and flights, we offer brewery tours, events, and a great place to gather with friends. We have a small on-site retail store as well. Outside food is always welcome, and there are a number of great locations in our neighborhood that offer take out. In addition to the neighborhood cuisine, our parking lot has become a hot spot for food trucks, with one parked outside nearly every night we\u2019re open. On May 5th, 2013 we had our grand opening with our first ever Heritage Festival. We\u2019re now seven days a week for brewery tours and tastings, and we have full roster of weekly events.","website":"http:\/\/www.angelcitybrewing.com\/","established":"1997","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0ZIlVA\/upload_q87thj-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0ZIlVA\/upload_q87thj-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0ZIlVA\/upload_q87thj-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0ZIlVA\/upload_q87thj-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0ZIlVA\/upload_q87thj-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:15:22","locations":[{"id":"5tw2Iw","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"216 S Alameda St","locality":"Los Angeles","region":"California","postalCode":"90013","phone":"310-329-8881","website":"http:\/\/www.angelcitybrewing.com\/","latitude":34.0466054,"longitude":-118.2378181,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1997","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"z2mLGQ","name":"B.D.T.K.","nameDisplay":"B.D.T.K.","description":"Light in color (but not in flavor), a malty sweetness greets the nose of this classically delicious German-style beer.

Unlike most commercial breweries, we do nothing to our water but remove the chlorine added to it. Our fresh beer is made with real glacial water and all the minerals that come with it!\r\n\r\nThe premium beers that we brew have grown from roots grounded deeply in tradition. Our dedicated Brewmaster uses time-tested recipes and brewing methods in our traditional, English-style brewery. Our hops and malts are sourced from around the world as to provide true styles with the unique twist of glacial water.

The brewery is a small 17-barrel (527 gallon) batch system and operates on the Acevedo's rural residential property.  Within seven months of opening El Toro Brewing Company received its first national recognition at the 1994 Great American Beer Festival (GABF). One of its flagships El Toro Oro Golden Ale won a coveted Gold Medal for English Pale Ale. At the 1996 GABF Poppy Jasper Amber Ale, the brewery's other flagship beer, won a Silver Medal for English Brown Ale. It is a mild yet robust brown ale. The 1997 GABF saw El Toro garner another Gold Medal for the American styled wheat beer named after the brewer's father-in-law, William Jones Wheat Beer.  After 16 years of planning, Geno and Cindy Acevedo of Morgan Hill finally opened a brewpub on November 25 2006. El Toro Brewpub is a two floored building with patio. Inside is the world's only Poppy Jasper Bar. Featuring over 45 feet of gorgeously inlaid and polished Poppy Jasper rock into its surface. To the back of the large mirrored bar you will find over 25 beers and handcrafted sodas on tap. We also have a gleaming copper Pub Brewing system 3 BBL (100 gallon) brewery. Live music and dancing will also be a regular nighttime happening at the brewpub consisting of mostly local bands playing cover type and original Rock, Blues, Jazz and Reggae.","website":"http:\/\/www.eltorobrewing.com\/","established":"1992","mailingListUrl":"info@eltorobrewing.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/yuxw75\/upload_Idq3L2-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/yuxw75\/upload_Idq3L2-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/yuxw75\/upload_Idq3L2-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/yuxw75\/upload_Idq3L2-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/yuxw75\/upload_Idq3L2-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:45:15","locations":[{"id":"4F7QA9","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"17605 Monterey Road","locality":"Morgan Hill","region":"California","postalCode":"95037","phone":"408-782-2739","website":"http:\/\/www.eltorobrewing.com\/","latitude":37.1304557,"longitude":-121.6546846,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"dadokQ","name":"Baron Von Nordwestlich","nameDisplay":"Baron Von Nordwestlich","abv":"5.1","styleId":45,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/dadokQ\/upload_Je2I7y-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/dadokQ\/upload_Je2I7y-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/dadokQ\/upload_Je2I7y-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-08-27 13:52:35","updateDate":"2015-12-17 16:12:26","style":{"id":45,"categoryId":4,"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"German-Style K\u00f6lsch \/ K\u00f6ln-Style K\u00f6lsch","shortName":"K\u00f6lsch","description":"K\u00f6lsch is warm fermented and aged at cold temperatures (German ale or alt-style beer).

It was a time of amazing progress.  Electricity was cutting-edge technology, and the possibilities seemed endless.  Hard times lay ahead for the country and for Buffalo though; The Great War would rage and The Great Depression would last for nearly a decade before the United States would emerge from the second World War as the leader of the Free World.\r\n\r\nWhat does any of that have to do with a startup craft-brewery?  The New Buffalo Brewing Co. shares the same passion for progress.  Buffalo produced over half a million barrels of brew in 1896, but by the end of the 1970's, production halted to almost zero. The United States is emerging from that low point as the world leader in brewing. Home brewing is continually growing, and new nano-breweries are popping up everywhere. Once again, The United States is leading the way by taking brewing forward into the next golden age.\r\n\r\nSo raise your glass in a toast to progress; It\u2019s time to bring brewing back to Buffalo!","website":"http:\/\/www.newbuffalobrewing.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/mq9W2O\/upload_K5Eog9-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/mq9W2O\/upload_K5Eog9-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/mq9W2O\/upload_K5Eog9-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/mq9W2O\/upload_K5Eog9-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/mq9W2O\/upload_K5Eog9-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-04-21 18:02:29","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:29:14","locations":[{"id":"x0saIe","name":"Office","streetAddress":"P.O.
