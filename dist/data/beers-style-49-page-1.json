We knew what we wanted to drink, but we needed some help actually brewing it. So we enlisted our first brewer, took over some warehouse space on the Boston waterfront, and began introducing fresh, local craft beer to Boston drinkers. We tried to do it in a way that captured the spirit of fun that had brought us to beer in the first place. From that warehouse, surrounded by fish companies on the docks of South Boston (neighboring what is now the Seaport District), we couldn\u2019t imagine that craft brewing would become what it has today.  \r\n\r\nWe still remember our days on the other side of the bar, and have spent as much time spreading the joy of beer drinking as we have focusing on recipes, ingredients, and brewing equipment. Hopefully our sense of gratitude is reflected in both the quality of the beer and the spirit of fun and enjoyment surrounding our beer and breweries.

It is located in the city of Drammen, approximately 25 miles south of our capital, Oslo. You will spot it at the banks of the Drammen River at the very same place as it has been since 1834. The annual production of beer is aprox. 10 mill liter (85 000 barrels), and together with the production of 18 mill liters of soft drinks and mineralwater it gives employment to approximately 150 people.  You may wonder how we got our name ? It was a young fellow with the name Poul Lauritz Aass that bought the brewery in 1860. Since then it has been in the same family, and is today run by the 4th generation of Aass. (By the way - A real Norwegian viking would pronounce it Ouse)  The brewery is proud of its history. To us the quality of what we produce has always been and always will be the main issue. In 1516, Duke Wilhelm of Bavaria established a law admitting only malted barley, hops yeast, and water as ingredients in the production of beer. The law is known as the purity law and Aass Brewery is still loyal to Duke Wilhelm of Bavaria. In Norway the brewery is known for outstanding quality and large number of different beer types.","website":"http:\/\/www.aass.no","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TGtEbk\/upload_rooKoF-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TGtEbk\/upload_rooKoF-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TGtEbk\/upload_rooKoF-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TGtEbk\/upload_rooKoF-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TGtEbk\/upload_rooKoF-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:43","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:38:13","locations":[{"id":"gaVq6l","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Ole Steensgt. 10 Postboks 1530","locality":"Drammen","phone":"47-32-26-60-00","website":"http:\/\/www.aass.no","latitude":59.7440738,"longitude":10.2044564,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"NO","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:43","updateDate":"2015-11-20 18:30:48","country":{"isoCode":"NO","name":"NORWAY","displayName":"Norway","isoThree":"NOR","numberCode":578,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"fIL9PT","name":"Hatz Weizen Kristallklar","nameDisplay":"Hatz Weizen Kristallklar","abv":"5.2","styleId":49,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-12 11:59:36","updateDate":"2015-04-14 18:22:51","style":{"id":49,"categoryId":4,"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"South German-Style Kristall Weizen \/ Kristall Weissbier","shortName":"Kristallweizen","description":"The aroma and flavor of a Weissbier without yeast is very similar to Weissbier with yeast (Hefeweizen\/Hefeweissbier) with the caveat that fruity and phenolic characters are not combined with the yeasty flavor and fuller-bodied mouthfeel of yeast.

Texas Hill Country's newest microbrewery will feature Classic and German-style beers. PBC\u2019s impressive lineup of beers will include skillfully crafted lagers and ales. At this time we are offering our flagship brands; LOBO and LOBO Negro. \u201cLOBO\u201d is the name of the WOLF native to Texas and the Southwest.  Sadly, the wolf was almost wiped out by big ranchers some 100 years ago; not unlike the small craft brewers who were similarly annihilated by prohibition.","website":"http:\/\/www.pedernalesbrewing.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/DEbm7U\/upload_ihN7Ep-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/DEbm7U\/upload_ihN7Ep-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/DEbm7U\/upload_ihN7Ep-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/DEbm7U\/upload_ihN7Ep-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/DEbm7U\/upload_ihN7Ep-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:05","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:25:02","locations":[{"id":"P49SWX","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"97 Hitchin Post Trail","locality":"Fredericksburg","region":"Texas","postalCode":"78624","phone":"830-669-2917","website":"http:\/\/www.pedernalesbrewing.com\/","latitude":30.239188,"longitude":-98.868388,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:05","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Ekoo4j","name":"Martini Weissbier Kristallklar","nameDisplay":"Martini Weissbier Kristallklar","styleId":49,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-12 12:09:48","updateDate":"2015-05-28 18:49:21","style":{"id":49,"categoryId":4,"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"South German-Style Kristall Weizen \/ Kristall Weissbier","shortName":"Kristallweizen","description":"The aroma and flavor of a Weissbier without yeast is very similar to Weissbier with yeast (Hefeweizen\/Hefeweissbier) with the caveat that fruity and phenolic characters are not combined with the yeasty flavor and fuller-bodied mouthfeel of yeast.

The phenolic characteristics are often described as clove- or nutmeg-like and can be smoky or even vanilla-like. Banana-like esters are often present. These beers are made with at least 50 percent malted wheat, and hop rates are quite low. Hop flavor and aroma are absent. Weissbier is well attenuated and very highly carbonated, yet its relatively high starting gravity and alcohol content make it a medium- to full-bodied beer. The color is very pale to deep golden. Because the beer has been filtered, yeast is not present. The beer will have no flavor of yeast and a cleaner, drier mouthfeel. The beer should be clear with no chill haze present. No diacetyl should be perceived.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"15","abvMin":"4.9","abvMax":"5.5","srmMin":"3","srmMax":"9","ogMin":"1.047","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:29:35"},"breweries":[{"id":"uNEYgw","name":"Familienbrauerei Bauh\u00f6fer","nameShortDisplay":"Familienbrauerei Bauh\u00f6fer","website":"http:\/\/www.ulmer-bier.de\/","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-07 10:16:31","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:30:36","locations":[{"id":"deFrF3","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Ullenburg Stra\u00dfe 12","locality":"Renchen","postalCode":"77871","latitude":48.579718,"longitude":8.048522,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-16 12:42:44","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
