Located on a hill overlooking Lake Michigan, the property had a few craggy apple trees remaining in the fields.\r\nDuring family trips to visit Yannique\u2019s French father in Brittany, we always enjoyed going to Creperie restaurants to eat savory galettes and sweet crepes, accompanied by a bottle of cidre brut. Over time, as Bob became more interested in cider, we started traveling to the Pays D\u2019Auge region of Normandy, where we tasted many varieties of this traditional beverage that is typically served with meals, and is the perfect complement to the wonderful cuisine of the area.\r\nAs we experienced the cider culture of northern France, we realized that nothing like these dry, complex ciders existed in the U.S., and we became excited about the prospect of introducing a French-style cider to the American palate. Back at our orchard, we began planting cider cultivars from France, England and America, while testing the types that would work best with the Island\u2019s climate and rocky limestone soil. Our Washington Island orchard has expanded with our passion for cider, and we now produce several varieties of gluten-free cider in our Cider House in the small town of Ellison Bay, WI, located at the tip of the Door Peninsula.","website":"http:\/\/islandorchardcider.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/yy3cTm\/upload_1kRAgF-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/yy3cTm\/upload_1kRAgF-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/yy3cTm\/upload_1kRAgF-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/yy3cTm\/upload_1kRAgF-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/yy3cTm\/upload_1kRAgF-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-08-01 14:09:54","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:14:21","locations":[{"id":"l9BVLi","name":"Main Cidery","streetAddress":"12040 Garrett Bay Rd","locality":"Ellison Bay","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"54210","phone":"(920) 854-3344","website":"http:\/\/islandorchardcider.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"SPRING (5\/1\u20135\/24)\r\nFri: 2-5 pm\r\nSat: 12-5 pm\r\nSun: 12-3 pm\r\nOpen Memorial Day 5\/25:\r\n12-3 pm\r\n\r\nSUMMER (5\/29\u20139\/14)\r\nDaily: 12-6 pm\r\n\r\nFALL (9\/17\u201310\/26)\r\nThurs: 12-4 pm\r\nFri\/Sat. : 12-6 pm\r\nSun\/Mon: 12-3 pm\r\n\r\nWINTER (10\/30\u201311\/28)\r\nFri: 2-6 pm\r\nSat: 12-5 pm\r\nSun: Closed","latitude":45.2563309,"longitude":-87.0712481,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"cidery","locationTypeDisplay":"Cidery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-08-01 14:13:52","updateDate":"2015-08-01 14:13:52","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"eV99Qx","name":"Burley Man","nameDisplay":"Burley Man","abv":"7.5","styleId":150,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-11-12 14:59:04","updateDate":"2015-11-12 14:59:04","style":{"id":150,"categoryId":12,"category":{"id":12,"name":"Mead, Cider, & Perry","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"English Cider","shortName":"English Cider","description":"Generally dry, full-bodied, austere.","abvMin":"6","abvMax":"9","ogMin":"1.05","ogMax":"1.075","fgMin":"0.995","fgMax":"1.01","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:48:47"},"breweries":[{"id":"aMIEke","name":"Griffin Claw Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Griffin Claw","description":"Griffin Claw Brewing Company is a Michigan based Microbrewery focusing on top quality beer production using state-of-the-art equipment and technology.

Over time, as Bob became more interested in cider, we started traveling to the Pays D\u2019Auge region of Normandy, where we tasted many varieties of this traditional beverage that is typically served with meals, and is the perfect complement to the wonderful cuisine of the area.\r\nAs we experienced the cider culture of northern France, we realized that nothing like these dry, complex ciders existed in the U.S., and we became excited about the prospect of introducing a French-style cider to the American palate. Back at our orchard, we began planting cider cultivars from France, England and America, while testing the types that would work best with the Island\u2019s climate and rocky limestone soil. Our Washington Island orchard has expanded with our passion for cider, and we now produce several varieties of gluten-free cider in our Cider House in the small town of Ellison Bay, WI, located at the tip of the Door Peninsula.","website":"http:\/\/islandorchardcider.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/yy3cTm\/upload_1kRAgF-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/yy3cTm\/upload_1kRAgF-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/yy3cTm\/upload_1kRAgF-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/yy3cTm\/upload_1kRAgF-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/yy3cTm\/upload_1kRAgF-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-08-01 14:09:54","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:14:21","locations":[{"id":"l9BVLi","name":"Main Cidery","streetAddress":"12040 Garrett Bay Rd","locality":"Ellison Bay","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"54210","phone":"(920) 854-3344","website":"http:\/\/islandorchardcider.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"SPRING (5\/1\u20135\/24)\r\nFri: 2-5 pm\r\nSat: 12-5 pm\r\nSun: 12-3 pm\r\nOpen Memorial Day 5\/25:\r\n12-3 pm\r\n\r\nSUMMER (5\/29\u20139\/14)\r\nDaily: 12-6 pm\r\n\r\nFALL (9\/17\u201310\/26)\r\nThurs: 12-4 pm\r\nFri\/Sat. : 12-6 pm\r\nSun\/Mon: 12-3 pm\r\n\r\nWINTER (10\/30\u201311\/28)\r\nFri: 2-6 pm\r\nSat: 12-5 pm\r\nSun: Closed","latitude":45.2563309,"longitude":-87.0712481,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"cidery","locationTypeDisplay":"Cidery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-08-01 14:13:52","updateDate":"2015-08-01 14:13:52","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"AMNlRH","name":"Organic Cider","nameDisplay":"Organic Cider","description":"Bright straw-gold with excellent clarity, Samuel Smith's Organic Cider has a light body with brilliant conditioning, a crisp clean flavor, and a dry finish.
