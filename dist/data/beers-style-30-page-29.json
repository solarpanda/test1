The hobby turned into an obsession, and the obsession has led them to open up a craft brewery in Ashland, Virginia. Located in the heart of Central Virginia, it is affectionately known as \u201cThe Center of the Universe\u201d. COTU will be brewing an assortment of ales using only whole ingredients, while sticking to the traditional all-natural method of brewing beer.\r\n\r\nThe meaning of \u201cCenter of the Universe\u201d is important to the founders of COTU. With so much emphasis today on globalization and the lack of corporate stewardship, COTU wanted to be a company that truly embraces the local community. \u201cCenter of the Universe,\u201d to COTU, is taking pride in where you live and respecting the people with whom you interact. We believe it is our responsibility to understand and appreciate how our actions affect the community that supports us.\r\n\r\nAt Center of the Universe Brewing Company it all revolves around the beer and the people who enjoy it.","website":"http:\/\/cotubrewing.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/B00bip\/upload_vm0TM5-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/B00bip\/upload_vm0TM5-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/B00bip\/upload_vm0TM5-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/B00bip\/upload_vm0TM5-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/B00bip\/upload_vm0TM5-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-11-16 18:12:00","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:38:54","locations":[{"id":"8AR41p","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"11293 Air Park Rd.","locality":"Ashland","region":"Virginia","postalCode":"23005","phone":"(804) 368-0299","website":"http:\/\/cotubrewing.com\/","latitude":37.708939,"longitude":-77.446687,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-11-16 18:12:45","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"78F9Hw","name":"Flower Child","nameDisplay":"Flower Child","abv":"6.52","glasswareId":5,"styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/78F9Hw\/upload_pzSAlv-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/78F9Hw\/upload_pzSAlv-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/78F9Hw\/upload_pzSAlv-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-02-24 15:11:11","updateDate":"2015-12-17 01:29:19","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

Let\u2019s start a craft beer brewery!\u201d  That Clarity in Thinking, led to the successful launch of Lucid Brewing.\r\n\r\nIn June of 2011, with a year of planning already completed, they realized jumping headfirst into the brewery was the only way they could make their dream a reality.  They quit their day jobs.  \r\n\r\nWith that leap of faith \u2013 and a ton of support from many friends and family \u2013 they started building their brewery from the ground up.  Through the sweltering heat of the 2011 summer, many friends labored side by side with Jon and Eric.  They did it all, start to finish, from digging trenches to assembling the last tank.  So of course they needed a refreshing and light drink to quench their thirst while they toiled away.  They found just the right recipe and brewed their first beer \u2013 AIR.  A beer made to get the job done.  Its slight citrus aroma and flavor, lower ABV and crisp dry finish made this their favorite \u201cgo to\u201d beer.  \r\n\r\nBy October the brewery was complete and cooking.  And in the spirit of the season, Eric and Jon gave thanks to the Brew gods when they made their first deliveries to their first three customers the week of Thanksgiving\u2026 in Jon\u2019s car.  Lucid was on its way!\r\n\r\nAlways keeping an eye on the demand for high quality while quickly catching the craft beer lover\u2019s attention, Lucid assembled a team of dedicated employees and introduced brews to quench their customers\u2019 demands.   AIR, DYNO, FOTO and DUO, along with seasonal and small-batch brews, are quickly becoming Minnesota favorites at local bars and restaurants.  \r\n\r\nGreat success has followed them after throwing away the daily grind for the daily brew.","website":"http:\/\/www.lucidbrewing.com\/","established":"2011","mailingListUrl":"www.LucidBrewing.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0cACKo\/upload_KCE6lg-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0cACKo\/upload_KCE6lg-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0cACKo\/upload_KCE6lg-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0cACKo\/upload_KCE6lg-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0cACKo\/upload_KCE6lg-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:01","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:22:32","locations":[{"id":"1xeovq","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"6020 Culligan Way","locality":"Minnetonka","region":"Minnesota","postalCode":"55345","phone":"612-810-9324","website":"http:\/\/lucidbrewing.wordpress.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Thu - Fri: 5:00 pm - 8:00 pm\r\nSat: 12:00 pm - 5:00 pm","latitude":44.895218,"longitude":-93.449725,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2009","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:01","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"5J83To","name":"Foul Weather","nameDisplay":"Foul Weather","styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-09-16 18:44:13","updateDate":"2015-09-21 17:12:38","style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.
