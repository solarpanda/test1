It was thirsty work. And that's where Coors Brewing Company came in. When we began in that same year, we were a small, family-owned brewery, located at the foot of the Rocky Mountains. We were busy creating the same kind of crisp, refreshing beer we're known for today. While hundreds of such family-owned breweries have come and gone in the years since, we believe the reasons for our success are simple. We've never compromised on quality in producing our award-winning brews and we've never lost sight of our rich Rocky Mountain heritage. Just as important, we've always believed in doing well by doing good. We treat our employees with respect, we support the local communities where we do business, and we strive to protect the environment.

We were busy creating the same kind of crisp, refreshing beer we're known for today. While hundreds of such family-owned breweries have come and gone in the years since, we believe the reasons for our success are simple.

Er steht gegen\u00fcber der Pfarrkirche, wo einst schon die R\u00f6mer siedelten. Denn Grinzing hat Tradition: ein Vorort zu Wien, eine Landpartie f\u00fcr das B\u00fcrgertum, ein bewahrtes Dorf in der Gro\u00dfstadt. In seiner bewegten Geschichte konnte Grinzing stets das Wahrhaftige erhalten und das Neue behutsam integrieren. So blieben die einzigartige Landschaft, der hervorragende Wein und die Liebe zum guten Essen. \r\n\r\nWir finden das gut.\r\n\r\nIm Zeichen dieser Philosophie bieten wir unseren G\u00e4sten \u2013 ob privat oder Firmen \u2013 heute eine wahrhaft gro\u00dfe Bandbreite. Etwa an Kulinarischem: von Alt Wiener Heurigen-Klassikern bis zu saisonalen Spezialit\u00e4ten und unsere Weine vom eigenen Winzerbetrieb Martinshof. Oder an Ideen f\u00fcr Feiern: von Heurigenmusik bis zur Anfahrt mit einer Oldtimer-Tramway, von der privaten Weinverkostung mit Freya und Michael Martin, den Winzern des Martinshofs, bis zu Festen im Freien oder im wundersch\u00f6nen Kellergew\u00f6lbe. Apropos: Wir sind ein bisschen stolz auf unsere vielf\u00e4ltigen R\u00e4umlichkeiten. Denn manchmal braucht man eine lauschige Nische f\u00fcr zwei. An anderen Abenden einen ruhigen Tisch f\u00fcr ein paar Gesch\u00e4ftspartner. Mal feiert man Omas Geburtstag zu drei\u00dfigst, einmal das Fest seines Lebens mit 400 Freunden. Ist uns alles recht. Der Martin Sepp stellt sich auf seine G\u00e4ste ein, gediegen f\u00fcr einen formellen Rahmen, gem\u00fctlich f\u00fcrs Verweilen. \r\n\r\nWir freuen uns auf Sie.","website":"http:\/\/www.zummartinsepp.at\/","mailingListUrl":"office@zummartinsepp.at","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/4Mk99f\/upload_9kdGpP-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/4Mk99f\/upload_9kdGpP-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/4Mk99f\/upload_9kdGpP-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/4Mk99f\/upload_9kdGpP-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/4Mk99f\/upload_9kdGpP-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-09-05 20:27:02","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:15:51","locations":[{"id":"uof3yv","name":"Main Winery","streetAddress":"Cobenzlgasse 34","locality":"1190 Vienna","region":"Vienna","latitude":48.2574304,"longitude":16.338888,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"AT","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-09-05 20:47:16","updateDate":"2015-09-05 20:48:28","country":{"isoCode":"AT","name":"AUSTRIA","displayName":"Austria","isoThree":"AUT","numberCode":40,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
