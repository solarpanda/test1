Milly's opened through the hard work and love of the craft of Master Brewer Peter Telge, a New Hampshire native, who has been brewing his own beers for the better part of 20 years. With the closing of the Stark Mill Brewery and the many changes that have befell the city in the recent years, Peter felt that Manchester, as New Hampshire's Queen City, was sadly falling the way of commercial and contract beers. He, with a dedicated following of fans of his brew, set to work reopening the brewery as \"Milly's Tavern,\" proudly operating as Manchester's only brew pub. We welcome you as our guests to stop by and try a glass of Peter's hard work.","website":"http:\/\/millystavern.com\/","established":"2002","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/DTsVn8\/upload_IvUQ57-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/DTsVn8\/upload_IvUQ57-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/DTsVn8\/upload_IvUQ57-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/DTsVn8\/upload_IvUQ57-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/DTsVn8\/upload_IvUQ57-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:02","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:52:24","locations":[{"id":"8gAMPa","name":"Main Brewpub","streetAddress":"500 Commercial Street","locality":"Manchester","region":"New Hampshire","postalCode":"03101","phone":"603-625-4444","website":"http:\/\/millystavern.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Thu: 11:00 am - 11:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:00 am - 1:00 am\r\nSun: 11:00 am - 6:00 pm","latitude":42.9940958,"longitude":-71.467279,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2002","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:02","updateDate":"2014-09-26 13:37:15","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"FLKgIy","name":"General Pippo's Porter","nameDisplay":"General Pippo's Porter","description":"Deep toffee color with rich roasty and subtle hop aroma.

After a temporary stint at Northern Brewer and a job as an assistant brewer at Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery, Flat Earth opened in Saint Paul and set out to create beers not normally found in the upper Midwest. Flat Earth's distinctive brews are often inspired by the couple's travels and time spent in conversation with family and friends. The company's brewing on the edge philosophy is reflected in its stylish interpretation of traditional brewing assumptions. Today, Flat Earth Brewing produces a variety of artisan ales and lagers every month. As the beers roll out of the brewery, you're sure to see a theme develop around their names  a hint of conspiracy, perhaps. The names are meant to get people thinking and talking. Whether you enjoy Flat Earth beers at home or out with friends, there are no secrets when it comes to good beer.","website":"http:\/\/flatearthbrewing.com\/","established":"2007","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/AulWoF\/upload_iM4ovC-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/AulWoF\/upload_iM4ovC-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/AulWoF\/upload_iM4ovC-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/AulWoF\/upload_iM4ovC-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/AulWoF\/upload_iM4ovC-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:45:56","locations":[{"id":"6gpvgZ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2035 Benson Avenue","locality":"St. Paul","region":"Minnesota","postalCode":"55116","website":"http:\/\/flatearthbrewing.com\/","latitude":44.9084187,"longitude":-93.1538067,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"LNr16q","name":"Hamm's Building","streetAddress":"688 Minnehaha Avenue East","locality":"Saint Paul","region":"Minnesota","postalCode":"55106","phone":"(651) 698-1945","website":"http:\/\/www.flatearthbrewing.com","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Sat: 12:00 pm - 6:30 pm","latitude":44.9629992,"longitude":-93.0716823,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-05-23 13:42:34","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"lyg0ei","name":"Gilpin Black Gold","nameDisplay":"Gilpin Black Gold","description":"Dark and beautiful, this London Porter gathers together all of beer\u2019s darker glories.

If other people want to drink it, bathe in it, rub it on their hips and let it eat through to their liver, freeze it into ice blocks in winter and skate on it, then melt it in spring time and drink it, or whatever they decide to do with it, it\u2019s all an added bonus for us.","website":"http:\/\/7cent.com.au\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/yzjEGx\/upload_Ca1NEt-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/yzjEGx\/upload_Ca1NEt-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/yzjEGx\/upload_Ca1NEt-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/yzjEGx\/upload_Ca1NEt-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/yzjEGx\/upload_Ca1NEt-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-23 04:47:31","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:05:17","locations":[{"id":"pky8dy","name":"7 Cent Brewing","streetAddress":"Couangalt Rd","locality":"Gisborne South","region":"Victoria","postalCode":"3437","website":"http:\/\/7cent.com.au\/","latitude":-37.5409914,"longitude":144.6158616,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"AU","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-23 23:28:14","updateDate":"2015-11-20 17:58:10","country":{"isoCode":"AU","name":"AUSTRALIA","displayName":"Australia","isoThree":"AUS","numberCode":36,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"49r3Yx","name":"Glazed Ham Porter","nameDisplay":"Glazed Ham Porter","description":"Mmmmm, Glazed Ham.

Luckily, everyone managed to make it off the mountain alive, and with a new outlook on life.\r\n\r\nHorn Dog Denver Colorado BeerLike any good beer drinker would at the end of an experience like that, George and his group found a local Pakistani hotel bar to have a drink in. Now, alcohol is banned in most Muslim nations, but if you sign an affidavit stating you are the son of a Christian, it\u2019s like a license to drink. George gladly signed away and got down to some serious drinking. That\u2019s about the time he noticed a painting in the Flashman Hotel of a Flying Dog hanging on the wall that had been drawn by a local artist. Now, we all know dogs don\u2019t fly, but nobody told this particular dog it couldn\u2019t fly, just like no one had told George and his friends they couldn\u2019t make this extraordinary journey. The Flying Dog became a symbol that George and his group used to describe what had happened to them with the mantra, \u201cit is amazing what you can achieve if nobody tells you that you can't.","website":"http:\/\/www.flyingdogbrewery.com\/","established":"1990","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jmGoBA\/upload_H9xzdZ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jmGoBA\/upload_H9xzdZ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jmGoBA\/upload_H9xzdZ-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jmGoBA\/upload_H9xzdZ-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jmGoBA\/upload_H9xzdZ-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:46:05","locations":[{"id":"EPqUQP","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"4607 Wedgewood Blvd","locality":"Frederick","region":"Maryland","postalCode":"21703","phone":"301-694-7899","website":"http:\/\/www.flyingdogales.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Tours are offered every Thursday and Friday from 4 to 6 pm, along with two sessions on Saturday (12 to 2 pm and 2:30 - 4:30 pm).","latitude":39.361926,"longitude":-77.424677,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1983","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"vfYMAp","name":"G\u00f6teborgsPorter","nameDisplay":"G\u00f6teborgsPorter","description":"Ocean Porter kan s\u00e4gas vara en porter av Londonstil.

The idea spread as friends tasted the unique beers, and the popularity of those early batches encouraged a dedicated team of three partners to begin working to make the dream of a local brewery a reality. Mark Seibold, JD Merryweather and Daniel Mercer spent the next two years traveling throughout the United States, Europe and Central America visiting breweries and sampling local flavors. The insight gained from entrepreneurs, brewers, biologists, operations personnel and consumers provided an invaluable basis for a serious endeavor into quality commercial brewing. By integrating this knowledge with the local, regional and national brewing trends, as well as local feedback, the trio planned the birth and growth of the yet unnamed COOP. After nearly 3 years of research, comprising thousands of man hours and dozens of test batches, COOP fashioned its identity as a steadfast professional team that holds closely a passion for bringing quality, local beer to taps and homes in Oklahoma City and beyond.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWith the help of close friends and fellow craft-beer fans, COOP was capitalized on July 15th, 2008. In less than 6 months, the COOP team; navigated the multi-layered regulatory process, secured a building lease, completed the remodel, purchased and installed a commercial brewery, obtained brewing licenses from the State of Oklahoma and the Federal Tax and Trade Bureau, created and branded original recipe beers and brewed the first full scale batches for distribution.\r\n\r\nThe outpouring of support that has come from friends of the COOP team has been overwhelming. Our sincere hope is that you \u2013 the fan of COOP Ale Works \u2013 will take pride in the beers, as if they were your own.

Overall, Highland Park Brewery has a fairly simple goal of making excellent beer and having a good time along the journey.","website":"http:\/\/www.thehermosillo.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/q8pAoY\/upload_FSdFOy-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/q8pAoY\/upload_FSdFOy-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/q8pAoY\/upload_FSdFOy-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/q8pAoY\/upload_FSdFOy-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/q8pAoY\/upload_FSdFOy-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-01-19 14:05:07","updateDate":"2016-03-21 18:56:37","locations":[{"id":"noV8kb","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"5125 York Blvd","locality":"Los Angeles","region":"California","postalCode":"90042","phone":"(323) 739-6459","latitude":34.1211667,"longitude":-118.2037952,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-01-19 14:05:08","updateDate":"2015-11-18 21:19:31","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"NvktMe","name":"Hammond's Porter Vanilla Porter","nameDisplay":"Hammond's Porter Vanilla Porter","glasswareId":5,"availableId":1,"styleId":18,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/NvktMe\/upload_8Gs8zQ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/NvktMe\/upload_8Gs8zQ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/NvktMe\/upload_8Gs8zQ-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-01-03 11:58:50","updateDate":"2015-12-16 22:03:11","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":18,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Brown Porter","shortName":"Brown Porter","description":"Brown porters are mid to dark brown (may have red tint) in color.

Both Wayne and Mark were avid homebrewers for many years. Mark continued on with his brewing education by completing the Web-based Concise Course in Brewing Technology at the Siebel Institute of Technology World Brewing Acadamy from which he obtained his Certificate.   We selected our location nestled in the heart of the beautiful Finger Lakes Region of upstate New York for its close proximity to Keuka Lake and the availability for lake water for brewing. Our building offered a spacious workable layout, ample parking and room for future expansion. We began our building renovations and equipment installation in early 2010,  received our license in the fall of 2010, and on November 11th, 2010 opened our doors for tours, tastings, and growler fills. \r\n\r\nOur Brew Room features a matched Ripley 7 Barrel Stainless Steel Brewing system. The Brew House includes a Boil Kettle, Mash Tun and Hot Liquor Tank. The Brew Room also features 3 double wall digital temperature controlled fermentation tanks, grain mill, filter, and other assorted brewing equipment. Adjacent to the brew room is a walk-in cooler containing 8 - 7 Barrel Stainless Steel Serving Tanks and assorted keg filling and dispensing equipment. \r\n\r\nThe entrance way and tasting room offer large windows for great views of the Brew Room  as well as a large comfortable area for you and your friends to relax and visit while enjoying your favorite brews offered fresh daily. We offer tastings and growler fills of fine crafted ales and root beer all brewed on premises as well as guided tours on non-brewing days. Have your own growlers, we fill your clean growlers. Don't own one yet, no worries we have 1 and 2 liter in several styles with our logo on them.","website":"http:\/\/www.fingerlakesbeercompany.com\/","established":"2009","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:19:26","locations":[{"id":"kKNkdr","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"8462 St Rt 54","locality":"Hammondsport","region":"New York","postalCode":"14840","phone":"607-569-3311","website":"http:\/\/www.fingerlakesbeercompany.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sunday 12:00 - 5:00                                         Monday 12:00-6:00                                    Tuesday       CLOSED                                  Wednesday 12:00-6:00                                       Thursday 12:00-6:00                                            Friday 12:00-6:00                                             Saturday 12:00-6:00","latitude":42.400165,"longitude":-77.224988,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2009","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"40UriQ","name":"Hard Wired Nitro Coffee Porter","nameDisplay":"Hard Wired Nitro Coffee Porter","description":"Super smooth with chocolate malt, coffee and toffee notes.","abv":"6","styleId":18,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/40UriQ\/upload_EnSFKx-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/40UriQ\/upload_EnSFKx-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/40UriQ\/upload_EnSFKx-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","servingTemperature":"cold","servingTemperatureDisplay":"Cold - (4-7C\/39-45F)","createDate":"2015-11-10 14:49:11","updateDate":"2016-04-04 18:51:01","style":{"id":18,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Brown Porter","shortName":"Brown Porter","description":"Brown porters are mid to dark brown (may have red tint) in color.
