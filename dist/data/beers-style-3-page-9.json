Just kidding!!\r\n\r\nTo make a long story short, Pete and Scot spent their formative years playing baseball at the West Middleton Town Hall.  Ever since, the words \"Town Hall\" evoke memories of community, relaxing with friends and happiness.  When Pete and Scot were reacquainted in Minneapolis they opened the Town Hall.\r\n\r\nTucked away on the fringes of downtown Minneapolis, the Town Hall offers a refreshing alternative to other eating and drinking establishments.  Its relaxed environment attracts a diverse crowd of college students, business people, professors, theater patrons and many more.\r\n\r\nThe Town Hall makes some of the best beer in America and provides an atmosphere where its patrons can relax and enjoy them.
