We look beyond contemporary trends and call upon the wisdom of ancient brewing cultures. We resurrect lost recipes with precision and expertise, using the same ingredients as our forgotten ancestors. We honor the Lost Tribes by reviving their culture and flavor.\r\n\r\nFor almost 8000 years mankind has been creating alcoholic brews to raise a glass to a higher power or enliven the power within. Exacting craftsmen would develop brewing into an art form, becoming professionals revered by the community and receiving divine privilege from popular spiritual deities. While the social stature of the brew master endures, many recipes and techniques have unfortunately been lost to history; and it was from the discovery of such a lost brew that Lost Tribes was born.\r\n\r\nOn our travels through the ancient lands of Western Asia, we met a small community that had walked from Ethiopia to Israel, bringing with them long-forgotten wisdom and tradition. Along with this they had brought the recipe of a forgotten brew called Tej - the fabled gift to King Solomon from the Queen of Sheba. Under instruction in her family kitchen, an elderly woman taught us the process of its brewing, sharing the long-preserved and refined heritage to exact the brew to perfection.\r\n\r\nAlongside the Lost Tribes range of inspired traditional beers sits the signature series. Comprised of resurrected brews that were previously lost to time, the signature series embodies the values and flavors of history\u02bcs brewing pioneers. In this way we honor the lost tribes that have not had the chance to tell their story, and those who inspire us when they share theirs.

But it was a long, long time in the works.  Like any business, there were big ups and downs on the road to the first pour and we think that story is worth sharing.  So here goes....\r\n \r\nJosh Stacy grew up like any other kid in America, playing music, sports, and sharing his space with two siblings.  Totally normal--with one exception.  His father, Steven Stacy, was an award-winning home brewer.  Steve was brewing world class beers in his kitchen before most people had even heard of the hobby.\r\nJosh grew up thinking every kid helped their dad bottle homemade beer on Saturday mornings before they could watch cartoons.   \r\nFast-forward a few years.  Stacy and Goodridge meet in junior high, become fast friends, and begin playing music together (and have been ever since).  Even more years went by.  Between the two there were graduations, marriages, children, careers, and beer.  Yes, beer.  At some point (memories are fuzzy) Stacy introduced Goodridge to drinking real, full-flavored craft beers.  It wasn't long before he introduced Goodridge to brewing real, full-flavored craft beers.  Goodridge was hooked.  \r\n\r\nMany weekends were spent in the Stacy home garage milling grain, mashing in, adding hops, and pitching yeast.  The two took in as much of Steve Stacy's brewing knowledge as possible, brewing good beer and having a couple pints throughout the brew day.  That always loosened the tongue.  Next would inevitably come the conversation about taking this hobby to the next level.  \r\n\r\nGoodridge heard this conversation more times than he can remember.  On a Sunday afternoon while leisurely enjoying a fine craft beer at home with his wife Trisha, he got a wild idea.  Enough was enough, he told her.  He immediately called Stacy and said, \"I'm coming over to your house.\"  Goodridge passionately pleaded his case to Josh and Beth.  \"Rolla needs fresh craft beer and we're the guys for the job.\" \r\n\r\nJosh Stacy wasn't a hard sell as he had always truly wanted to do this, but now they needed help from their wives to make this dream happen.  Thankfully, these wonderful ladies agreed to take the plunge and the four embarked on the treacherous journey together to bring fresh craft beer to Rolla.  Many trials and triumphs later, Public House Brewing Company opened its doors on December 16th, 2010, to a very thirsty populous. \r\n\r\nOne week later, all the beer they had made was gone.  It was\r\na hit!  The Rolla area embraced its first and only craft brewpub and put Public House on the map.  Now the Stacys and Goodridges are fulfilling their dream of bringing hand-crafted beers of the highest quality to Mid-Missouri.  You are invited to come in and have a pint with us.  Cheers!\r\n \r\nNow that you know our story, we encourage you to come in and share yours. No matter what the occasion, visiting The Public House Brewery is always an extraordinary experience.  \r\n \r\nThe team at Public House looks forward to welcoming you!","website":"http:\/\/www.publichousebrewery.com\/","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BumlJd\/upload_BVZXT3-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BumlJd\/upload_BVZXT3-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BumlJd\/upload_BVZXT3-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BumlJd\/upload_BVZXT3-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BumlJd\/upload_BVZXT3-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:25:15","locations":[{"id":"e0v4NA","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"600 North Rolla Street","extendedAddress":"Suite B","locality":"Rolla","region":"Missouri","postalCode":"65401","phone":"573-426-2337","website":"http:\/\/www.publichousebrewery.com\/","latitude":37.9484144,"longitude":-91.7725297,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"4vof7m","name":"Rodeo Red","nameDisplay":"Rodeo Red","styleId":25,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:44:06","updateDate":"2012-03-22 13:04:53","style":{"id":25,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"American Pale","description":"American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.

Rogue's first brewpub was located in Ashland, Oregon and was a 10bbl brewsystem. Rogue opened a second brewpub, 15bbl brewsystem, in May 1989 located in Newport, Oregon. Rogue closed its Ashland operation in 1997, after the great flood destroyed the place. In 1991, the 15bbl system, named Howard after John Maier's former boss, from the Newport brewpub was transferred across the bay to the current brewery and upgraded to a 30bbl system. In 1998 Rogue bought a 50bbl brewsystem, named Kobe. Kobe is the only brewsystem in use. Tours: We offer brewery tours every day at 3 pm (followed by a distillery tour at 4pm). Go up to the bar inside the brewery (Brewers on the Bay) and check in with the bartender and the tour will commence. Please call ahead if you have a large group and or to verify the tour time...Brewer's on the Bay phone is 541-867-3664.
