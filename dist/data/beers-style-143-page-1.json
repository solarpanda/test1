At Brothers Drake, our philosophy on making mead is based on the following principles:\r\n\r\n1. Start Local: We buy local honey, support local agriculture, and produce a local product.\r\n\r\n2. Use the Best: We look for the highest quality local product on the market, ordering from the best from the source closest to Ohio.\r\n\r\n3. No Heat: We do not boil our honey or any water used in production. The No Heat Method keeps honey flavors true to the source and a better mead.\r\n\r\n4. No Added Sulfites: Unlike grapes which have wild yeast growing on them, honey is naturally antiseptic and antibiotic, so no sulfites needed.\r\n\r\n5. Build community: We share our knowledge openly and are grateful to people everywhere who ask questions, share their perspective, and engage in an open collaborative dialogue on mead-making.\r\n\r\n6. Embrace creativity: Our mead can be paired with wonderful cheeses, appetizers, and entrees, as well as used in cooking and in mixed drinks.\r\n\r\nThese basic principles guide our craft, our partnerships, and our practices. We look forward to sharing a drink with you!","website":"http:\/\/brothersdrake.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/IEFRaK\/upload_g95Ivt-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/IEFRaK\/upload_g95Ivt-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/IEFRaK\/upload_g95Ivt-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/IEFRaK\/upload_g95Ivt-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/IEFRaK\/upload_g95Ivt-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:48","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:11:09","locations":[{"id":"0Y6wSh","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"26 E. 5th Avenue","locality":"Columbus","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"43201","phone":"614-388-8765","website":"http:\/\/brothersdrake.com\/","latitude":39.987311,"longitude":-83.004595,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:48","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"9cIjW4","name":"Bardic Gold","nameDisplay":"Bardic Gold","abv":"6","styleId":143,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-01-11 20:34:19","updateDate":"2016-01-11 20:34:19","style":{"id":143,"categoryId":12,"category":{"id":12,"name":"Mead, Cider, & Perry","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Cyser (Apple Melomel)","shortName":"Cyser","description":"In well-made examples of the style, the fruit is both distinctive and well-incorporated into the honey-sweet-acid-tannin-alcohol balance of the mead.

All of our grapes and apples are brought in from the West side of Michigan. We then do all the pressing in the cider mill and fermenting and bottling in the winery building. Every bottle is filled and labeled by hand. The winery produces several alcoholic wines, hard cider flavors and most recently BEER! We are also adding a small distillery soon!","website":"http:\/\/www.thenorthvillewinery.com\/","mailingListUrl":"Northvillewinery@gmail.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/6KskqD\/upload_PVHVtK-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/6KskqD\/upload_PVHVtK-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/6KskqD\/upload_PVHVtK-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/6KskqD\/upload_PVHVtK-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/6KskqD\/upload_PVHVtK-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-04-10 13:21:59","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:07:27","locations":[{"id":"PbIpTo","name":"Northville Winery & Brewing Company","streetAddress":"630 Baseline Road","locality":"Northville","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"48167","website":"http:\/\/www.thenorthvillewinery.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Thu:\r\n6:00 pm - 10:00 pm\r\nFri:\r\n3:00 pm - 10:00 pm\r\nSat:\r\n12:00 pm - 10:00 pm","latitude":42.4396009,"longitude":-83.4849105,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-08-04 01:12:11","updateDate":"2015-08-04 15:57:09","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"trgwT0","name":"The Crabby Granny","nameDisplay":"The Crabby Granny","description":"Our cyser!
