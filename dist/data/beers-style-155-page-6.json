The aroma sports a sweetly sour note that serves as a strong layering over the peach and apple notes that linger below. There is a definite Asturian character to this cider that is made with Apples, pears and a little quince. It\u2019s a light bodied sip that possesses a good balanced of moderate tannin and acid., but delivers a very smooth caress across the palate. The carbonation here is extraordinarily slight. The flavors follow the nose. A sour, acetic character that will remind most of fresh, light vinegar is first and foremost onto the palate. And there is a certain fresh intensity to this flavor. Past this, you get to notes of dry hay, herbs, and sour apple. The cider finishes with a slight bitter note derived from lingering tannins. This is a very unique American cider insofar as the aroma and flavor profile is unlike most produced in this country, though it will be very familiar to those who drink the Asturian ciders from Spain. It\u2019s very good, very refreshing, unique and made with care and determination.

The Northville Winery originated across the parking lot in Parmenters Northville Cider Mill in 1982. Rob and Carina Nelson started making their own wine over 5 years ago and they have been expanding ever since, including adding a microbrewery this year. All of our grapes and apples are brought in from the West side of Michigan. We then do all the pressing in the cider mill and fermenting and bottling in the winery building. Every bottle is filled and labeled by hand. The winery produces several alcoholic wines, hard cider flavors and most recently BEER!

This land has been in our family since the 1920\u2019s when our grandfather planted his first trees in Tieton, Washington. We take our stewardship of the land seriously and have been farming organically for the last 25 years.\r\n\r\nAs a third generation Yakima Valley farmer with a degree in horticulture from Washington State University and over thirty five years\u2019 experience in marketing produce, Craig has always been curious about the back-story: the history, production, science, and industry of food. Growing different varieties of trees is truly what makes Craig happy and he is always looking for new varieties to plant and nurture.  In 2008 he was introduced to cider apple varieties, those gnarly, inedible wild apple varieties needed to make great cider.  He planted twenty five varieties in a test block of two acres to study the growing patterns: did each fit into the existing bloom and harvest schedule of the farm, what were the flavor profiles of the fruit and how did that variety add to the cider that we wanted to make.\r\n\r\nFrom that original twenty five, Craig has narrowed it down to the eight most suitable for commercial production, never closing the door on annual experimentation when he learns of a new variety. We now have the largest acreage of cider apples and Perry pears in the state of Washington with 55 acres.\r\n\r\nThe Yakima Valley is the largest apple producing region in Washington and there is an infrastructure existing in our valley that provides many advantages when you are making cider.  Whether we are storing our apples in controlled atmosphere, sending our apricots and cherries to be processed, or selecting the complementary hops and pumpkin for our seasonal ciders \u2013 it all exists in the valley we call home.\r\n\r\nA love of land, food and drink has inspired us to make cider with the fruit we are growing at our ranch, Harmony Orchards.  We know the ciders we make are an expression of the harvest and reflective of the fruit and the place that it is grown.","website":"http:\/\/tietonciderworks.com\/","established":"1920","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-16 20:31:38","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:04:59","locations":[{"id":"9ASIXD","name":"Main Cidery","streetAddress":"619 West J Street","locality":"Yakima","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98902","phone":"509-571-1430","website":"http:\/\/tietonciderworks.com\/","latitude":46.6158588,"longitude":-120.5217865,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"cidery","locationTypeDisplay":"Cidery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-17 12:36:21","updateDate":"2015-02-17 12:36:21","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"I3hQhK","name":"Zesty Blood Orange","nameDisplay":"Zesty Blood Orange","description":"Our master tasters have blended the refreshing taste of Bulmers Original with the citrusy kick of blood orange to create a truly unique flavor.","abv":"4","styleId":155,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-16 15:07:46","updateDate":"2015-03-16 15:07:46","style":{"id":155,"categoryId":12,"category":{"id":12,"name":"Mead, Cider, & Perry","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Fruit Cider","shortName":"Fruit Cider","description":"Like a dry wine with complex flavors.
