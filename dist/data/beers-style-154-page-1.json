These hardworking bees are solitary and wild, emerging early in the cool spring just in time to pollinate apple blossoms.\r\n\r\nAt Blue Bee Cider, we aim to create balanced ciders true to their Virginia roots from a culinary perspective and true to the fruit from a cidermaking one. Each apple variety ferments differently, creating its own flavors which vary year to year depending on weather conditions. Blue Bee Ciders are never chapitalized (it\u2019s so sunny in the South, who needs to add sugar?) and never watered down.

This aromatic off-dry cider is as robust as our pioneers and the Pippin apple trees that flourished on our frontier. Raise a glass of Sea Cider and let our apples tease your senses!\r\n\r\nThe Story: Pippins is a tribute to the pioneers that homesteaded on Vancouver Island and across North America. A \u201cpippin\u201d is an apple tree that grew from an errant seed (unlike most apple trees, which are propagated by grafting). Pippins cider reflects the story of how apple varieties developed during North America\u2019s pioneering age, when many of the Old World varieties failed to thrive, but their seeds produced a generation of new varieties. The Yellow Newton Pippin is one such apple, and the main varietal in Sea Cider\u2019s Pippins. This apple is high in both acid and sugar (important features in traditional North American cider varieties).  Pippins cider is made in the New England pre-Prohibition style, which means sharply acidic, but balanced with subtle sweetness, and high in alcohol thanks to chapitalization. Fermentation is undertaken at cool temperatures to preserve fruity aromas and to maintain the acidity. A dosage of organic cane sugar is added during fermentation to raise the level of alcohol (this was traditionally important to improve the shelf life of cider during the pioneering days).\r\n\r\nTasting Notes:\r\nAppearance: Effervescent, warm straw in colour, clear, bright.\r\nAromas, flavours: Citrus, apple, pear, lemongrass, pineapple, confectionary.\r\nAcid\/sweetness: Intense acidity, balanced by slight residual sweetness.\r\nMouthfeel: Crisp, sharp to the tongue.","abv":"9.5","styleId":154,"isOrganic":"Y","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/sj5PSg\/upload_sPleHx-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/sj5PSg\/upload_sPleHx-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/sj5PSg\/upload_sPleHx-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"Truth be told, Pippins pairs well with pretty much everything!
