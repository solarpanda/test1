While the name of the company remains Clipper City Brewing Company, all of its beer falls under the Heavy Seas brand. Heavy Seas is located at 4615 Hollins Ferry Road, Suite B, in the Halethorpe section of Baltimore. Heavy Seas currently offers a variety of beer styles in approx. 18 states within the United States.\r\n\r\nHeavy Seas mission is to bring back the local brewery, and to do it in such a way that we are more than just a fringe player, but a positive part of our area. To accomplish this mission we have created a broad portfolio of products with enough diversity that we have at least one beer that can appeal to everyone. Whether your preference is for a classic American style lager beer, or a big, challenging Hop Cubed Ale, we have a something that will suit your taste.

With a focus on the revival of artisan brewing, we strive to create the highest quality products available.\r\n\r\nBrewing techniques as timeless as beer itself are used to create a uniquely handmade product. We craft the finest possible beer in small batches normally not found in the industry today which is typically dominated by mega mergers of international breweries. Is this difficult and more time consuming? Yes. Does it require more manual labor? Yes. Is it worth it? Unequivocally, YES. As beer is a \u201cliving, breathing\u201d product made from precise strains of active yeast cultures, it just makes good sense to nurture the product in very manageable small batches. We believe that the extra care and attention devoted to each batch produces the best possible result and you as our friends deserve no less.\r\n\r\nWe hope that you will have the opportunity to experience the limited quantities of hand crafted beer that we produce in Charlotte. When you do, please notice the complexities of the aroma, the silkiness of its body, and the explosion of flavors as the grains merge artfully with the yeast cultures and noble hops blended meticulously for each variety.

Nick graduated from the University of Missouri-Columbia with a degree in Chemical Engineering. After graduation, Nick got a call from the Harpoon Brewery in Boston and they were willing to give him a shot. While he was working out east, he enjoyed the superb beer culture and variety of beers available in New England. But he knew that he would one day return to Missouri. Finally, after three years, probably too many beers, and the addition of his son, Nick finally got his chance to come back to Missouri. He worked at a small brewpub in Kansas City called The 75th Street Brewery where he was able to experiment with many different beer styles and brewing techniques. Again after a few years, Nick grew restless. While working at a brewpub was fun and enjoyable, it just had too many other distractions from his true passions... Brewing beer, drinking beer and spreading the word about craft beer.\r\nSo he started the Doodle Brewing Company with every intention of brewing beers and beer styles that explore the boundries of flavor. He's probably sitting in front of his brewhouse right now with a beer enjoying what he's doing because he's making beer for you.","website":"http:\/\/www.doodlebrewing.com\/","established":"2008","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ifZ8V4\/upload_anonA5-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ifZ8V4\/upload_anonA5-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ifZ8V4\/upload_anonA5-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ifZ8V4\/upload_anonA5-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ifZ8V4\/upload_anonA5-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:13:35","locations":[{"id":"bTThBS","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"600 Haines Drive","locality":"Liberty","region":"Missouri","postalCode":"64068","website":"http:\/\/www.doodlebrewing.com\/","latitude":39.254543,"longitude":-94.455085,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2008","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"OZahUd","name":"Dubbel Down","nameDisplay":"Dubbel Down","abv":"7.2","availableId":4,"styleId":58,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-02 22:58:16","updateDate":"2013-05-03 01:03:28","available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":58,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Dubbel","shortName":"Belgian Dubbel","description":"This medium-bodied, red to dark brown colored ale has a malty sweetness and chocolate-like caramel aroma.

Both had put together plans for their company vision and, as luck would have it, those plans mirrored each other!  The two joined forces and Quest Brewing Company was founded.\r\n\r\nOnce the business was formed, a brewery name was needed.  After weeks of brainstorming, the name \u2018Quest\u2019 rose to the top of our list.  We wanted a name that emulates that passionate and adventurous spirit of the Greenville community.\r\n\r\n\u201dPeople in Greenville are always on some kind of quest.  Whether it is to bike the entire Swamp Rabbit Trail or hike Table Rock, there is a very adventurous spirit here.  We wanted to embrace that.\u201d -Quest\u2019s Andrew Watts\r\n\r\nQuest\u2019s beer is meant to be premium and sought-after, much like a goal or quest.
