By 1994, we outgrew the original site (now our 100-seat brew pub) and moved up the road to a larger facility to keep up with demand.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe brew over 160,000 barrels of beer and 10,000 barrels of root beer in our state-of-the-art brewing facility. Our lagers and ales are brewed in small batches, hand-crafted by a team of dedicated workers with only the highest ideals of quality.

In five years, the brewery has more than doubled its brewing capacity - from 2,000 barrels per year to over 5,000 barrels per year and has won fifteen nationally-recognized awards, including a Bronze Medal at the 2008 World Beer Cup for Bucking Bock and 2009 National Grand Champion from the United States Beer Tasting Championships for Iron Thistle.","website":"http:\/\/www.rahrbrewery.com\/","established":"2004","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/WCBdy2\/upload_ixkkW0-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/WCBdy2\/upload_ixkkW0-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/WCBdy2\/upload_ixkkW0-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/WCBdy2\/upload_ixkkW0-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/WCBdy2\/upload_ixkkW0-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:55:35","locations":[{"id":"X6U0o8","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"701 Galveston Avenue","locality":"Fort Worth","region":"Texas","postalCode":"76104","phone":"817-810-9266","website":"http:\/\/www.rahrbrewery.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Wed:5:00 pm - 7:30 pm\r\nSat:1:00 pm - 3:00 pm","latitude":32.7368128,"longitude":-97.3275585,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2004","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2014-10-29 16:04:43","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"cYTBh9","name":"Blue Eyed Blonde","nameDisplay":"Blue Eyed Blonde","abv":"5.2","ibu":"12","glasswareId":5,"srmId":4,"availableId":1,"styleId":78,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","servingTemperature":"very_cold","servingTemperatureDisplay":"Very Cold - (0-4C\/32-39F)","originalGravity":"1.049","createDate":"2014-09-10 03:38:10","updateDate":"2015-07-10 16:31:24","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"srm":{"id":4,"name":"4","hex":"FFBF42"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":78,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"M\u00fcnchner (Munich)-Style Helles","shortName":"Helles","description":"This beer should be perceived as having low bitterness.

This made it impossible for microbreweries or small brewpubs to exist. In 1985 Uli Bennewitz went to his local senator and together they passed a bill allowing microbreweries to sell their own beer on site. A year later on the July 4th, 1986 the Weeping Radish Brewery opened for business. \r\n \r\nRaised in a small village in Bavaria, Uli was determined to bring the high quality beer he was used to across the ocean to North Carolina. A Master Brewer came over from Germany and brewed the first batches of Corolla Gold, Fest, and Black Radish. Strictly adhering to the Reinheitsgebot Purity Law of 1516, all Weeping Radish beers are brewed using hops, malt, yeast and water \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no additives, chemicals or preservatives. \r\n \r\nOur beer list has expanded over the years and currently on draft in the pub we have the OBX K\u00c3\u00b6lsch, IPA 25, and Radler as well as our original Corolla Gold, Fest and Black Radish.

Since then, the Central PA natives have been handcrafting world-class beers that blend traditional brewing techniques with the innovation and eclecticism of the American craft brewing movement. Today, the Hershey, PA-based brewery produces six year-round beers (Hopback Amber Ale, Troegenator Double Bock, JavaHead Stout, Tr\u00f6egs Pale Ale, DreamWeaver Wheat, and Perpetual IPA); four seasonal releases as part of the Hop Cycle series (Cultivator Helles Bock, Sunshine Pils, Hop Knife Harvest Ale, and Blizzard of Hops Winter IPA); and two limited beers (Nugget Nectar and Mad Elf Ale). \r\n\r\nIn addition to these beers, Tr\u00f6egs produces a variety of experimental, small batch beers as part of its Scratch Beer Series. These beers are available exclusively at the brewery and most are draft-only limited releases, although some popular Scratch Beers (Fresh Hop Ale, Fest Lager, etc.) are bottled for release through the General Store at the brewery. \r\n\r\nIn late 2013, Tr\u00f6egs introduced a special line of cork & cage bottle releases. The first, LaGrave, is available year-round. Master of Pumpkins was also released in 2013 and will continue with availability in the fall. Other beers such as Jovial have since followed suit. The addition of a canning line not only offers the brewery more flexibility in the way it presents its beers, but also allows Tr\u00f6egs to provide customers with more packaging options. To date, Tr\u00f6egs has released Perpetual IPA and Sunshine Pils in 12-ounce cans and Troegenator in 16-ounce cans. Plans to release other seasonal and limited beers in cans are currently in the works. \r\n\r\nThe Splinter Series is an extremely limited line of barrel-aged beers packaged in cork & cage bottles. While only a handful of these beers have been produced, Tr\u00f6egs plans to expand this series with the inclusion of Nebulous (barrel-aged LaGrave with Brett), bourbon barrel-aged Troegenator, and others. \r\n\r\nTr\u00f6egs currently distributes its beers throughout Delaware, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Washington D.C. In addition, Tr\u00f6egs plans to expand into other New England markets in 2015.\r\n\r\nOur state-of-the-art facility gives visitors a glimpse into the workings of a full production brewery by offering both guided tasting and self-guided tours. Our Tasting Room provides ample seating with views of the brewhouse, where you can sit back and enjoy one of our six year-round beers as well as a variety of seasonal and small-batch experimental brews. \r\n\r\nOur Snack Bar reflects our constant desire to explore, discover and share by focusing on fresh, simple fare that is locally sourced and house-made. With that in mind, we feature a seasonally rotating menu with daily chef\u2019s specials.\r\n\r\nwww.troegs.com","website":"http:\/\/www.troegs.com\/","established":"1997","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/www.troegs.com\/about_us\/newsletter.aspx","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_d9lSk3-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_d9lSk3-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_d9lSk3-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_d9lSk3-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_d9lSk3-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:01:05","locations":[{"id":"C6iHOv","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"200 E Hersheypark Dr","locality":"Hershey","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"17033","phone":"717-232-1297","website":"http:\/\/www.troegs.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sun:  11:00am - 9:00pm\nThu:  11:00am - 10:00pm\nFri:  11:00am - 10:00pm\nSat:  11:00am - 10:00pm\n\nGeneral Store Hours\r\n------------------------------\r\nSunday: 11am to 5pm\r\nMonday - Saturday: 11am to 8pm","latitude":40.2972852,"longitude":-76.6428527,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1997","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2015-04-24 16:00:33","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"RjCH19","name":"Effinghamb\u00fcrgherbra\u00fc","nameDisplay":"Effinghamb\u00fcrgherbra\u00fc","description":"The Burgherbrau, our beer for the people, is a southern German-style Golden lager brewed using pale floor-malted German barley and noble hops: Hallertau, Tettnang and Saaz.\r\nEffinghamb\u00fcrgherbra\u00fc is cool-fermented and cold-conditioned for a refreshing and flavorful brew, perfect for sitting in your own biergarten and enjoying throughout the year.","abv":"5","ibu":"20","glasswareId":4,"srmId":4,"availableId":1,"styleId":78,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/RjCH19\/upload_vWYob2-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/RjCH19\/upload_vWYob2-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/RjCH19\/upload_vWYob2-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","servingTemperature":"cellar","servingTemperatureDisplay":"Cellar - (12-14C\/54-57F)","originalGravity":"1.05","createDate":"2014-01-02 17:55:40","updateDate":"2015-12-17 07:56:05","glass":{"id":4,"name":"Pilsner","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"srm":{"id":4,"name":"4","hex":"FFBF42"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":78,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"M\u00fcnchner (Munich)-Style Helles","shortName":"Helles","description":"This beer should be perceived as having low bitterness.

This customized equipment allows us to make truly exceptional beer with a high level of consistency. \r\n\r\nEquipment doesn\u2019t begin and end in the brew house. An often-overlooked main ingredient in beer is the water. Often brewers will believe that their local water source adds to their individuality of their product, or what wine makers call terroir. While this may be true to a large extent it overlooks the importance of a beer style\u2019s original water source when trying to replicate a specific style.  Without our Reverse Osmosis water filtration system we feel that producing a beer originating from a region with \u201csoft\u201d water just wouldn\u2019t bring that beer justice, being that our own regional water is extremely hard.  Reverse Osmosis gives us flexibility and allows us to properly pay respect and more accurately replicate brewing traditions from all over the world.\r\n \r\nOur brewing system also wouldn\u2019t be complete without putting thought into the storage of our beer. Many fantastic beers leave breweries and then suffer the consequences of entering the distribution chain that wasn\u2019t at all designed to deal with craft beer. At Garage Brewing Co, we choose our guest beer that has been handled with the utmost care, and we store our own beer just steps from where it was brewed and fermented. Our 10 BBL serving vessels ensure beer delivery in its freshest form and our draft\/tap system is highly engineered to ensure that we can pour our guests a proper pint.\r\n\r\nMany hours of thought and years of experience have been drawn from to ensure that Garage Brewing Co not only produces and serves and exceptional beer to its guests but does so in a way that respects the old world traditions.","website":"http:\/\/www.garagebrewco.com\/","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wGMKzx\/upload_fKNQhd-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wGMKzx\/upload_fKNQhd-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wGMKzx\/upload_fKNQhd-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wGMKzx\/upload_fKNQhd-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wGMKzx\/upload_fKNQhd-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-04-15 13:24:23","updateDate":"2016-01-19 22:24:25","locations":[{"id":"Jki0lE","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"29095 Old Town Front Street","locality":"Temecula","region":"California","postalCode":"92590","phone":"(951) 587-2537","website":"http:\/\/www.garagebrewco.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Thu: 11:30 am - 9:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:30 am - 10:00 pm\r\nSun: 11:30 am - 9:00 pm","latitude":33.4825051,"longitude":-117.1432478,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-04-15 13:25:18","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
