After returning to the states, they had trouble finding that type of beer in Chicago so they opened Two Brothers Brewing Company in 1996. To get them started, the brothers' grandfather, a retired dairy farmer, donated his bulk milk tanks, which were quickly converted to fermenters. Currently, the brewery resides in a 40,000 square foot facility 30 miles west of Chicago. In addition to their traditional style beers, Two Brothers Brewing Company produces many specialty beers including the Project Opus Sour series. Adjacent to the brewery, Two Brothers Tap House opened in 2008 as a restaurant which serves elevated, seasonal, and organic American pub fare. In 2011, the Ebel brothers purchased Walter Payton's Roundhouse located in Aurora, IL. The Two Brothers Roundhouse is a full service brewpub restaurant, music venue, offers banquet space for large parties and weddings and hosts the Two Brothers Cafe and Beer Bar! \r\n\r\nTwo Brothers Brewing Company's award winning products are currently available in Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Florida, New York, Iowa and Missouri.","website":"http:\/\/www.TwoBrothersBrewing.com\/","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Cu5xXG\/upload_FFc22Y-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Cu5xXG\/upload_FFc22Y-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Cu5xXG\/upload_FFc22Y-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Cu5xXG\/upload_FFc22Y-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Cu5xXG\/upload_FFc22Y-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:01:21","locations":[{"id":"jeOXxz","name":"Two Brothers Tap House","streetAddress":"30 w 315 Calumet Ave.","locality":"Warrenville","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60555","phone":"630.393.2337","website":"http:\/\/www.twobrotherstaphouse.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday        3:00 - 11:00\r\nTuesday        3:00 - 11:00\r\nWednesday   3:00 - 11:00\r\nThursday      3:00 - 11:00\r\nFriday         12:00 - 12:00\r\nSaturday     12:00 - 12:00\r\nSunday        12:00 - 9:00","latitude":41.824453,"longitude":-88.212512,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2015-07-14 13:53:02","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"YOdPoo","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"30W315 Calumet Ave.","locality":"Warrenville","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60555","website":"http:\/\/www.twobrosbrew.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"We are give tours EVERY Saturday at 1:00 and 2:30 and Sunday at 1:00.","latitude":41.824906,"longitude":-88.211221,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2012-01-26 12:57:18","updateDate":"2015-07-07 21:22:36","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"AiMDyF","name":"Two Brothers Roundhouse","streetAddress":"205 N.

Always looking to take a good thing too far, we sat down and over a beer (or two) decided that beer itself was a good idea. Of course, not just some easy-drinking institutional prole beer, but stuff like the beers we'd had at great bars. We had frequented places with extensive and varied beer lists. Places with lists 180 items long, all of which we tried twice (not in one night). In short, we wanted beer with flavor. Complexity. Character. Intensity. Not words found in the mass market lexicon.\r\n\r\nSo with a banjo burner, a bunch of industrial kitchen sized pots and as many buckets as we could find, we jumped in feet first. Once a week, every week. We tried to emulate the beers we liked, but soon we were adding a little of this, or some of that and after a while we started having a hard time pegging our beer in a style category. Our first success was a Porter that was mainly porter, slightly stout. We ran it blind with our friends against the porters we liked and people liked it. \"We're on to something\", we thought. Twenty iterations, modifications and tweaks later it is Distorter, and is still our favorite beer.\r\n\r\nThis led to twice a week brewing and handing out bottle after bottle to everyone we knew. Along the way we screwed up a wheat beer by accidentally making it into sort of a copper ale with a few too many hops. And so Red Bud Ale was born. We had some extra noble hops and threw them in the IPA, and with some tinkering we most certainly had a one-of-a-kind IPA. You get the picture. All of this has firmly cemented our \"anything goes\" approach to beer making. Our inability to ever get quite within the style guidelines means we may never win an award, but we're ok with that.\r\n\r\nNow, several years later and with a 90% super-cool\/10% Rube Goldberg 7 bbl version of our banjo burner and kitchen pots, we're befuddling the beer judges and converting the masses. One pint at a time.\r\n\r\nStop in the storefront and try our mainstays, seasonals and small-batch runs. Not to mention our lab beers, where we continue to screw up one thing or another in search of the next great beer.","website":"http:\/\/www.greenbushbrewing.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:19:53","locations":[{"id":"AlhRYb","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"5885 Sawyer Rd.","locality":"Sawyer","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49125","phone":"269-405-1076","website":"http:\/\/www.greenbushbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sunday - Thursday: 12-8\r\nFriday and Saturday: 12-10","latitude":41.8856286,"longitude":-86.5946671,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"a5loyh","name":"3 Fonteinen Beersel Bio","nameDisplay":"3 Fonteinen Beersel Bio","styleId":63,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-09-11 14:17:24","updateDate":"2015-09-11 17:38:23","style":{"id":63,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Pale Strong Ale","shortName":"Belgian Pale Strong","description":"Belgian pale strong ales are pale to golden in color with relatively light body for a beer of its alcoholic strength.

It became known in the region for brewing beers like \"La Druide\" and \"Brunehaut 8\u00b0\". In 1991 the company took on a new challenge and moved into modern buildings while maintaining its traditional character and the quality of its products, qualified as \"grand crus\" by connoisseurs. An alliance of Modernity and Tradition!\r\nThese are the company's motto, a real creed for the managers at Brunehaut Brewery.\r\n\r\nTradition, because the traditional brewery retains the entirely natural brewing method for late fermentation beers and that are refermented in bottles and kegs. The result: a panel of about a dozen abbey or organic beers, all valuable and unique. To ensure that the link to the region remains strong, the types of barley used in the brewing process are grown in our own farm at Gaurain-Ramecroix.\r\n\r\nModern, because modern and high performance machinery ensure scrupulous compliance with hygiene regulations and a top quality production with consistent flavour. Also modern in how we deal with the market: several beers from Brunehaut won prizes at international competitions and are currently present in 25 different countries.\r\nMarc-Antoine De Mees and his staff are still equally enthusiastic to allow the discovery of this knowledge and method.\u2026","website":"http:\/\/www.brunehaut.com\/","established":"1890","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gOaK1T\/upload_ppmToE-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gOaK1T\/upload_ppmToE-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gOaK1T\/upload_ppmToE-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gOaK1T\/upload_ppmToE-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gOaK1T\/upload_ppmToE-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:40:35","locations":[{"id":"tpbOyx","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Rue de Panneries 17","locality":"Brunehaut","region":"Hainaut","postalCode":"7623","phone":"32-069-34-64-11","website":"http:\/\/www.brunehaut.com\/","latitude":50.5111769,"longitude":3.3891665,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"BE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"BE","name":"BELGIUM","displayName":"Belgium","isoThree":"BEL","numberCode":56,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"jljAMc","name":"Abbey Rye","nameDisplay":"Abbey Rye","abv":"7.4","styleId":63,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-07-30 13:15:12","updateDate":"2015-07-30 13:15:12","style":{"id":63,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Pale Strong Ale","shortName":"Belgian Pale Strong","description":"Belgian pale strong ales are pale to golden in color with relatively light body for a beer of its alcoholic strength.

This passion has helped us push Allagash to the forefront of the growing Belgian beer category. We\u2019ve won countless awards for our beer (11 medals including 4 gold since 2002 at The Great American Beer Festival & 10 medals including gold & silver in 2012 since 1998 at the bi-annual World Beer Cup), and received acclaim in the press (Gourmet, Bon Appetit, Men\u2019s Journal, GQ, The Wall Street Journal and Saveur).

We brew in small batches and use several strains of yeast to produce our beers.   The drinker may notice slight nuances from batch to batch.

This results in a unique drinking experience each time a bottle is opened.\r\n\r\nHere at Draai Laag we like to cater to those that want something respectful of tradition, but ultimately different.  Those who are not satisfied drinking the norm.  Most importantly, we get our biggest enjoyment and fulfillment not from profit, but from your smile after the first sip.\r\n\r\nThis company was built on the dream of doing what we love and following our passion.

Jason Hendricks and Jason Schlaff met in the fall of  2009.  They didn\u2019t know then that their friendship would bloom, but when it did, a brewery would be the flower.\r\n\r\nThe Jasons started humbly with a five gallon pot, a homebrew starter kit, and an idea of what good should be.  The first brew was just ok, an American Ale extract kit that did not allow for any artistry.  They quickly realized they needed to switch things up in order to attain the flavors they wanted.  So, the two amateurs ventured into the world of all-grain brewing.  The first mash tun, a cooler, the first brew, a porter.  Jason and Jason had their first failure.  \r\n\r\nPoor taste and terrible color ruined their tongues but not their spirit.  They could do much much better.   Schlaff, an avid reader and researcher, dove head first into every book he could find.  Hendricks scoured the internet and talked to every expert he could find.  Armed with brains full of knowledge the two gents embarked on the brewing adventure again.  \r\n\r\nThe second beer, a blonde ale, crafted with the newfound comprehension they acquired.  After a two weeks of eager anticipation, success!  The Jasons now had the knowledge, the drive, and the skill.  Each ale after that was instant hit among their friends and family.  Gary Schlaff, Jason\u2019s distinguished father, joined the endeavor in 2013.  Gary, a marketing genius, is nearing retirement and has decided to throw his business knowledge into the mix.\r\n\r\nThe brewery itself will not serve or prepare food.  Patrons will be allowed to bring in outside food, as well as have food delivered to them at the brewery.\r\n\r\nWe strive to be as sustainable and as local as possible.  The brewhouse and fermenters will be purchased for Psycho Brew LLC of Greenville, MI.  Our hops will be purchased from the many growers in Michigan.  Our spent grain will be sold to local farmers instead of going to waste in a landfill.  As a side project, we will also used the spent grain to made organic dog treats.","website":"http:\/\/fbcbrewing.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ohbgYE\/upload_WwIcxm-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ohbgYE\/upload_WwIcxm-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ohbgYE\/upload_WwIcxm-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ohbgYE\/upload_WwIcxm-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ohbgYE\/upload_WwIcxm-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-11-24 00:48:05","updateDate":"2016-04-10 21:15:30","locations":[{"id":"fSqavF","name":"Farmington Brewing Company","streetAddress":"33336 Grand River","locality":"Farmington","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"48336","phone":"(248) 957-9543","website":"http:\/\/fbcbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Wed:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\nThu:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\nFri:  4:00pm - 11:00pm\nSat:  2:00pm - 11:00pm\nSun:  2:00pm - 9:00pm\n\n","latitude":42.464946,"longitude":-83.375958,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2014","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-11-24 00:51:59","updateDate":"2016-04-10 21:15:14","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"SFcK03","name":"Belgian Golden Strong","nameDisplay":"Belgian Golden Strong","abv":"10.4","ibu":"28","styleId":63,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"Duck and other French fair, nothing too spicy or complex.","createDate":"2015-04-08 16:47:24","updateDate":"2015-04-08 16:47:24","style":{"id":63,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Pale Strong Ale","shortName":"Belgian Pale Strong","description":"Belgian pale strong ales are pale to golden in color with relatively light body for a beer of its alcoholic strength.
