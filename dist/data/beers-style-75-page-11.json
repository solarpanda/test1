Following fourteen months of design, building and construction they finally fired up the brew kettle for the first time in December of 1999. Although the brewery was tiny and tucked in a basement on Pearl Street, the celebration and Grand Opening was enough to attract throngs of flavor starved people and get Mayor Medinger to tap the inaugural keg.\r\n\r\nWe have come a long way since. Today we brew, bottle and keg our beers from our new home in the historic La Crosse Footwear building with our expanded 30 barrel brewery. The new brewery has over six times the brewing capacity of the old Pearl Street Brewhouse. And while we spent the first 8 years slinging brews out to nearby pubs and restaurants in draught kegs only, in July of 2007, we unveiled bottled beer in six packs and cases.","website":"http:\/\/www.pearlstreetbrewery.com\/brewin\/","established":"1999","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/LWD44j\/upload_dWVveA-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/LWD44j\/upload_dWVveA-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/LWD44j\/upload_dWVveA-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/LWD44j\/upload_dWVveA-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/LWD44j\/upload_dWVveA-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:05","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:54:21","locations":[{"id":"Y6z24E","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1401 Saint Andrew Street","locality":"La Crosse","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"54603","phone":"608-784-4832","website":"http:\/\/www.pearlstreetbrewery.com\/brewin\/","hoursOfOperation":"Tue - Fri: 4:00 pm - 8:00 pm\r\nSat: 12:00 pm - 5:00 am","latitude":43.834352,"longitude":-91.236154,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1999","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:05","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Wwgba7","name":"Ruppaner Edel-Pils","nameDisplay":"Ruppaner Edel-Pils","abv":"5","styleId":75,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-12 11:57:54","updateDate":"2012-08-19 14:16:28","style":{"id":75,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"German-Style Pilsener","shortName":"German Pilsener","description":"A classic German Pilsener is very light straw or golden in color and well hopped.

The short form of Joseph is \u201cSepp\u201d or \u201cSeppel\u201d for \u201clittle Joseph\u201d. Obviously, by making beer the brave soldier Seppel was of much better use to the King of Sweden, because he was going lame due to an old battlefield injury to the leg. The injury was the cause for his nickname \u201cSchlappe-Seppel\u201d.\r\n\r\nThe beer of the brave soldier was very well received because of its excellence and very soon after the first brew, he had to make more beer. In the end, he stayed behind in Aschaffenburg, after the Swedish troops had left. He settled as a cooper and brewer. The Schlappeseppel Beer was born.","website":"http:\/\/www.schlappeseppel.de\/start\/?veri=checked&L=1","established":"1795","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/AMspsb\/upload_4Lmwhh-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/AMspsb\/upload_4Lmwhh-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/AMspsb\/upload_4Lmwhh-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/AMspsb\/upload_4Lmwhh-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/AMspsb\/upload_4Lmwhh-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-01-20 18:56:16","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:04:06","locations":[{"id":"yIYCYc","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Aschaffenburger Stra\u00dfe 3-5","locality":"Gro\u00dfostheim","postalCode":"63762","phone":"+49 6026 509-0","isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-09 14:49:41","updateDate":"2015-03-09 14:50:37","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"YTcxVj","name":"Schmucker Meister-Pils","nameDisplay":"Schmucker Meister-Pils","abv":"4.8","styleId":75,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-12 12:10:20","updateDate":"2012-08-17 00:05:51","style":{"id":75,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"German-Style Pilsener","shortName":"German Pilsener","description":"A classic German Pilsener is very light straw or golden in color and well hopped.

Since then, the Central PA natives have been handcrafting world-class beers that blend traditional brewing techniques with the innovation and eclecticism of the American craft brewing movement. Today, the Hershey, PA-based brewery produces six year-round beers (Hopback Amber Ale, Troegenator Double Bock, JavaHead Stout, Tr\u00f6egs Pale Ale, DreamWeaver Wheat, and Perpetual IPA); four seasonal releases as part of the Hop Cycle series (Cultivator Helles Bock, Sunshine Pils, Hop Knife Harvest Ale, and Blizzard of Hops Winter IPA); and two limited beers (Nugget Nectar and Mad Elf Ale). \r\n\r\nIn addition to these beers, Tr\u00f6egs produces a variety of experimental, small batch beers as part of its Scratch Beer Series. These beers are available exclusively at the brewery and most are draft-only limited releases, although some popular Scratch Beers (Fresh Hop Ale, Fest Lager, etc.) are bottled for release through the General Store at the brewery. \r\n\r\nIn late 2013, Tr\u00f6egs introduced a special line of cork & cage bottle releases. The first, LaGrave, is available year-round. Master of Pumpkins was also released in 2013 and will continue with availability in the fall. Other beers such as Jovial have since followed suit. The addition of a canning line not only offers the brewery more flexibility in the way it presents its beers, but also allows Tr\u00f6egs to provide customers with more packaging options. To date, Tr\u00f6egs has released Perpetual IPA and Sunshine Pils in 12-ounce cans and Troegenator in 16-ounce cans. Plans to release other seasonal and limited beers in cans are currently in the works. \r\n\r\nThe Splinter Series is an extremely limited line of barrel-aged beers packaged in cork & cage bottles. While only a handful of these beers have been produced, Tr\u00f6egs plans to expand this series with the inclusion of Nebulous (barrel-aged LaGrave with Brett), bourbon barrel-aged Troegenator, and others. \r\n\r\nTr\u00f6egs currently distributes its beers throughout Delaware, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Washington D.C. In addition, Tr\u00f6egs plans to expand into other New England markets in 2015.\r\n\r\nOur state-of-the-art facility gives visitors a glimpse into the workings of a full production brewery by offering both guided tasting and self-guided tours. Our Tasting Room provides ample seating with views of the brewhouse, where you can sit back and enjoy one of our six year-round beers as well as a variety of seasonal and small-batch experimental brews. \r\n\r\nOur Snack Bar reflects our constant desire to explore, discover and share by focusing on fresh, simple fare that is locally sourced and house-made. With that in mind, we feature a seasonally rotating menu with daily chef\u2019s specials.\r\n\r\nwww.troegs.com","website":"http:\/\/www.troegs.com\/","established":"1997","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/www.troegs.com\/about_us\/newsletter.aspx","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_d9lSk3-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_d9lSk3-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_d9lSk3-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_d9lSk3-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_d9lSk3-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:01:05","locations":[{"id":"C6iHOv","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"200 E Hersheypark Dr","locality":"Hershey","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"17033","phone":"717-232-1297","website":"http:\/\/www.troegs.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sun:  11:00am - 9:00pm\nThu:  11:00am - 10:00pm\nFri:  11:00am - 10:00pm\nSat:  11:00am - 10:00pm\n\nGeneral Store Hours\r\n------------------------------\r\nSunday: 11am to 5pm\r\nMonday - Saturday: 11am to 8pm","latitude":40.2972852,"longitude":-76.6428527,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1997","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2015-04-24 16:00:33","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"CVl8by","name":"Scrimshaw","nameDisplay":"Scrimshaw","description":"Named for the delicate engravings popularized by 19th century seafarers, Scrimshaw is a fresh tasting Pilsner brewed in the finest European tradition using Munich malt and, Hallertauer and Tettnang hops.

There is absolute no doubt that we run the safest brewing enterprise in the country as our premises used to be an air-raid shelter. Our premises have also been used for storing bibles, hence reigns an atmosphere of divine tranquillity only otherwise found in Belgian monasteries. Well...\r\n \r\nFounders of the brewery are the two friends and dedicated home brewers Mr. Morten Valentin Lundsbak and Mr. Jacob Storm, who since the opening of the brewery have achieved diplomas of their skills as they have become Diploma Brewers at the Scandinavian School of Brewing.\r\n \r\nIt is our ambition to cater to all beer lovers - every time, which is why we only use pure ingredients during the brewing process. We make no shortcuts by using artificial additives to speed or help the processes. Furthermore, we have deliberately chosen neither to pasteurize nor filter our beer as we would like to preserve the best possible flavours and aromas.\r\n \r\nWe allow the beer to mature completely in the bottle before releasing it to the market.

This sediment can easily be consumed, but if an aesthetic beer experience is desired, pour the beer gently into the glass without the sediment.

From a funky storefront on the famous Pacific Coast Highway the duo ran the \u201cPizza Port\u201d with a classic menu of pizza and chicken wings to which they added their own \u201cSan Diego\u201d twist.  The Original Pizza Port in Solana Beach\r\n\r\nThe parking was limited and the building crowded with simple hand-built picnic tables and a hodge-podge d\u00e9cor of surf-related paraphernalia almost at odds with the sophisticated flavors of the food. But word spread quickly and it wasn\u2019t long before Pizza Port was a local favorite. \r\n\r\nEarly on Vince took advantage of free space in the restaurant\u2019s storage area to dabble with home brewing. The hobby took off and he was eventually brewing more than could reasonably be consumed at home. So at the urging of friends and fans, the Vince and Gina decided to go into the brewpub business. Pizza Port offered its first craft-brewed beers to patrons in 1992. \r\n\r\nEmbracing the same \u201cflavor-driven\u201d principles that had made the pizza menu so popular, Pizza Port quickly gained a reputation in San Diego\u2019s nascent craft beer scene. In 1997 the company opened a second location a few miles north of Solana Beach in Carlsbad, and a third in 2003 in San Clemente. The same year San Clemente opened (as well as the year after), the original location in Solana Beach won Great American Beer Festival \u201cSmall Brewpub of the Year\u201d. \r\n\r\nThe Pizza Port family\u2019s reputation for great foods and craft beer continued to grow, making them landmarks not just for Southern Californians, but for beer lovers from around the world. In 2008 they opened a premium bottle shop with more that 600 craft beers adjacent to the Carlsbad locations, and by the end of the first decade of the 21st century, the Pizza Ports were a brewing dynasty. In 2009 the Pizza Ports won a staggering 9 medals at the 2009 Great American Beer Festival and Pizza Port Carlsbad was named \u201cLarge Brewpub of the Year\u201d.","website":"http:\/\/www.pizzaport.com\/","established":"1987","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QSVVxD\/upload_g7L5OH-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QSVVxD\/upload_g7L5OH-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QSVVxD\/upload_g7L5OH-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QSVVxD\/upload_g7L5OH-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QSVVxD\/upload_g7L5OH-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:10:31","locations":[{"id":"DrFlD0","name":"Carlsbad","streetAddress":"571 Carlsbad Village Dr.","locality":"Carlsbad","region":"California","postalCode":"92008","phone":"760-720-7007","website":"http:\/\/www.pizzaport.com\/locations\/carlsbad\/","latitude":33.1596505,"longitude":-117.3478111,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1997","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"qAyZMR","name":"Solana Beach","streetAddress":"135 N.

While the name of the company remains Clipper City Brewing Company, all of its beer falls under the Heavy Seas brand. Heavy Seas is located at 4615 Hollins Ferry Road, Suite B, in the Halethorpe section of Baltimore. Heavy Seas currently offers a variety of beer styles in approx. 18 states within the United States.\r\n\r\nHeavy Seas mission is to bring back the local brewery, and to do it in such a way that we are more than just a fringe player, but a positive part of our area.
