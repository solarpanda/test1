In late 1990 that dream became our state\u2019s first brewpub, Lazlo\u2019s Brewery & Grill. Since then demand for our beer has grown, so we expanded our pub and Empyrean Brewing Company was born. Today we still dream big even while we hand craft our beers in small flavor\u2013filled batches.

After that trip, the direction of the brewery was set. German beer had to be re-discovered by the population. After many discussions on opening a brewery and a trip to Germany, the dream became reality. We found an existing brewery to purchase - Lunar Brewing. After purchasing Lunar and getting approved for all the necessary licensing, Baron is ready to go. On June 14th, the world of Seattle will have the chance to finally taste and purchase Baron Beer. The first style of many to be released is our flagship beer - Munich Lager.That is all for the history.

These units, now over 50 years old, were originally used at the former Hoxter Brewery located in Germany.\r\n\r\nAt the heart of the operation is a group of loyal and hard working employees dedicated to producing the high quality beer that Capital Brewery is known for.\r\n\r\nMost of the beers brewed here at Capital consist of traditional ingredients, water, malted barley and wheat, hops and yeast. However, we do believe in experimentation to develop unique beer styles and varieties. We invite you to enjoy one of our beers in our brewery or take some home for a true Capital experience.\r\n\r\n\r\nCapital Brewery was established with an important mission in mind, and we continually build on that sentiment, by delivering a unique experience and award winning beers to meet the changing demands of the craft beer community.","website":"http:\/\/www.capitalbrewery.com\/","established":"1984","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/visitor.r20.constantcontact.com\/manage\/optin?v=001QKOUjm76P7aUowbU3bchMmLlIKSnJ2dJN7B3SnkK1I-Dde4Q3J1O8o_MbR3cMmc9UYntPMmGLsuW8he0ZzVEDAGaJ2Jp9MbLzBs7xf-IS0iQq4FuDhj02K5Wn2ywuNqT","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/tWHPRC\/upload_S3hy0Z-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/tWHPRC\/upload_S3hy0Z-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/tWHPRC\/upload_S3hy0Z-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/tWHPRC\/upload_S3hy0Z-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/tWHPRC\/upload_S3hy0Z-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:50","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:42:36","locations":[{"id":"1g0RBG","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"7734 Terrace Avenue","locality":"Middleton","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"53562","phone":"608-836-7100","website":"http:\/\/www.capital-brewery.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Tue:  4:00pm - 9:00pm\nWed:  4:00pm - 9:00pm\nThu:  4:00pm - 9:00pm\nFri:  4:00pm - 9:00pm\nSat:  12:00pm - 5:00pm\nSun:  12:00pm - 5:00pm\n\nMonday: CLOSED TO THE PUBLIC\r\nTuesday: 4:00pm-9:00pm\r\nWednesday: 4:00pm-9:00pm\r\nThursday: 4:00pm-9:00pm \r\nFriday: 4:00pm-9:00pm\r\nSaturday: 12:00pm-5:00pm\r\nSunday: 12:00pm-5:00pm","latitude":43.094848,"longitude":-89.5165838,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1984","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:50","updateDate":"2014-09-29 20:12:03","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"4NugVW","name":"Carlsberg 47","nameDisplay":"Carlsberg 47","abv":"7","availableId":4,"styleId":81,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","servingTemperature":"cool","servingTemperatureDisplay":"Cool - (8-12C\/45-54F)","createDate":"2013-11-06 22:08:21","updateDate":"2015-05-07 19:27:17","available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":81,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"German-Style M\u00e4rzen","shortName":"M\u00e4rzen","description":"M\u00e4rzens are characterized by a medium body and broad range of color.

Through the years the company has grown from a three person operation to a staff of almost 50, from about 4,000 to 35,000 square feet, and from a capacity to brew 2,000 barrels annually to almost 40,000. Those of you who saw the old brewery may remember the retrofitted dairy equipment we used. We held on to two of those tanks in our move to the East Asheville location. Alongside them, we have new fermentation and brite beer tanks to go with our 50-barrel brew house. Our pilot brew house is a brewer's playground for developing new seasonal beers, high gravity brews, and whatever else the brewers dream up. Highland currently supplies both Carolinas, Georgia, Tennessee, Florida, Alabama, Ohio, Kentucky and Virginia.

The villains of the peace in this story are two non-conformist, 'not likely to take it lying down' ranchers named George Stranahan and Richard McIntyre.\r\n\r\nAs George tells it, he and 11 of his closest friends and family decided to embark on what they called an \u201camateur mountaineering expedition\u201d to climb K2 in the Himalayas. Under-qualified and unprepared, they started their journey with a Sherpa, a donkey, and a suitcase full of contraband. Naturally, half way through the trip the contraband was gone and the Sherpa and donkey had run off, leaving George and his group to fend for themselves. Luckily, everyone managed to make it off the mountain alive, and with a new outlook on life.\r\n\r\nHorn Dog Denver Colorado BeerLike any good beer drinker would at the end of an experience like that, George and his group found a local Pakistani hotel bar to have a drink in. Now, alcohol is banned in most Muslim nations, but if you sign an affidavit stating you are the son of a Christian, it\u2019s like a license to drink. George gladly signed away and got down to some serious drinking. That\u2019s about the time he noticed a painting in the Flashman Hotel of a Flying Dog hanging on the wall that had been drawn by a local artist. Now, we all know dogs don\u2019t fly, but nobody told this particular dog it couldn\u2019t fly, just like no one had told George and his friends they couldn\u2019t make this extraordinary journey. The Flying Dog became a symbol that George and his group used to describe what had happened to them with the mantra, \u201cit is amazing what you can achieve if nobody tells you that you can't.","website":"http:\/\/www.flyingdogbrewery.com\/","established":"1990","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jmGoBA\/upload_H9xzdZ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jmGoBA\/upload_H9xzdZ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jmGoBA\/upload_H9xzdZ-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jmGoBA\/upload_H9xzdZ-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jmGoBA\/upload_H9xzdZ-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:46:05","locations":[{"id":"EPqUQP","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"4607 Wedgewood Blvd","locality":"Frederick","region":"Maryland","postalCode":"21703","phone":"301-694-7899","website":"http:\/\/www.flyingdogales.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Tours are offered every Thursday and Friday from 4 to 6 pm, along with two sessions on Saturday (12 to 2 pm and 2:30 - 4:30 pm).","latitude":39.361926,"longitude":-77.424677,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1983","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"R7lOei","name":"Duck-Rabbit M\u00e4rzen","nameDisplay":"Duck-Rabbit M\u00e4rzen","description":"Pours a brilliant auburn color with a lacy head.
