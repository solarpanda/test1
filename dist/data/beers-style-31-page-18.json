In 1996 the brewery was installed by New World Brewing Systems in the space behind our retail store and production began in September. In May of 2005 we open our second brewery in Scripps Ranch.  We currently distribute five of our favorite beers, Yellowtail Pale Ale,  Calico Amber Ale , Big Eye I.P.A., Black Marlin Porter and Wahoo Wheat Beer to a thirsty San Diego.  Come to our brewery and we will gladly give you a tour and allow you to sample our newest selection of beers. Currently our beer is available in twelve ounce bottles to 15.5 gallon kegs. We also offer half gallon and gallon glass jugs to go. Kegs are available for rent to the public with a minimum deposit.  The name for our brewery comes from the point where Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo first set foot in California. Located on the Point Loma Peninsula, Ballast Point is considered the gateway to San Diego Harbor. Stones from this area were used as ballast in the cargo holds of sailing ships returning to the eastern seaboard. Many New England streets are still lined with the cobblestones brought back from San Diego.","website":"http:\/\/www.ballastpoint.com\/","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:45","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:39:04","locations":[{"id":"PckBjw","name":"Home Brew Mart","streetAddress":"5401 Linda Vista Road","extendedAddress":"#406","locality":"San Diego","region":"California","postalCode":"92110","phone":"(619) 295-2337","website":"http:\/\/www.ballastpoint.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Tasting Room & Store Hours\r\nMonday-Friday, 11:00-7:00\r\nSaturday-Sunday, 10:00-5:00","latitude":32.7667586,"longitude":-117.1952129,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:45","updateDate":"2014-09-29 20:33:49","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"a7VHpi","name":"Scripps Ranch Brewery","streetAddress":"10051 Old Grove Rd","locality":"San Diego","region":"California","postalCode":"92131","phone":"(858) 695-2739","website":"http:\/\/www.ballastpoint.com\/","latitude":32.898466,"longitude":-117.110794,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-12-07 00:05:42","updateDate":"2015-06-11 14:39:57","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"cLcfTf","name":"Tasting Room & Kitchen","streetAddress":"2215 India St","locality":"San Diego","region":"California","postalCode":"92101","phone":"(619) 255-7213","website":"http:\/\/www.ballastpoint.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  11:00am - 11:00pm\nTue:  11:00am - 11:00pm\nWed:  11:00am - 11:00pm\nThu:  11:00am - 11:00pm\nFri:  11:00am - 11:00pm\nSat:  11:00am - 11:00pm\nSun:  11:00am - 9:00pm\n\n","latitude":32.7277143,"longitude":-117.1697202,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-21 12:03:59","updateDate":"2015-06-11 13:48:56","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"1zYgG4","name":"Miramar","streetAddress":"9045 Carroll Way","locality":"San Diego","region":"California","postalCode":"92121","phone":"8587906900","website":"www.ballastpoint.com","latitude":32.8881618,"longitude":-117.1580141,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2014","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-06-09 16:08:18","updateDate":"2015-06-16 14:59:03","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"gRg0OA","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"9045 Carroll Way","locality":"San Diego","region":"California","postalCode":"92121","phone":"8587906900","website":"www.ballastpoint.com","hoursOfOperation":"Mon\u2013Sat 11:00am\u201311:00pm\r\nSunday 11:00am\u20139:00pm","latitude":32.8881618,"longitude":-117.1580141,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2015-06-09 20:31:45","updateDate":"2015-06-16 14:59:48","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"kr3KqQ","name":"Ballast Point Brewing Company","streetAddress":"110 N.

At the turn of the century, this neighborhood was home to nearly 45,o00 inhabitants, most of them of German descent and 38 breweries. We hope to engender the spirit of camaraderie and hard work that we imagine those living and brewing in this neighborhood at that time embodied.\r\n\r\nWe self distribute our beer, which means each beer that you drink in a bar or restaurant is poured from a keg that we delivered cold in our refrigerated van (keep your eyes peeled for it around town). We like to keep beer as fresh as possible, which means that every keg we fill is immediately moved into cold storage where it sits until we load it onto our refrigerated van for delivery to the coldbox of each local account. Fresh beer is tasty beer, and that\u2019s our favorite kind.","website":"http:\/\/rhinegeist.com","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0s8yID\/upload_aZOo67-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0s8yID\/upload_aZOo67-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0s8yID\/upload_aZOo67-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0s8yID\/upload_aZOo67-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0s8yID\/upload_aZOo67-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-06-22 18:23:27","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:43:57","locations":[{"id":"202T0m","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1910 Elm St","locality":"Cincinnati","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45202","phone":"(513) 381-1356","website":"http:\/\/rhinegeist.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Thursday 4pm - 11pm\r\nFriday 4pm - 12am\r\nSaturday 12pm - 12am\r\nSunday 12pm - 7pm","latitude":39.1168193,"longitude":-84.5201739,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-06-22 18:26:59","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"4wxun1","name":"Homo Erectus Imperial IPA","nameDisplay":"Homo Erectus Imperial IPA","abv":"9","styleId":31,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-12-01 23:49:50","updateDate":"2015-02-10 22:19:55","style":{"id":31,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ale","shortName":"Imperial IPA","description":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma.

To get them started, the brothers' grandfather, a retired dairy farmer, donated his bulk milk tanks, which were quickly converted to fermenters. Currently, the brewery resides in a 40,000 square foot facility 30 miles west of Chicago. In addition to their traditional style beers, Two Brothers Brewing Company produces many specialty beers including the Project Opus Sour series.

From the beginning, we both found common ground having similar tastes in beer styles which progressed to a shared obsession of trying to figure out how our favorites were made.  We both shared in the fun of sharing our results with friends and watching their reactions, which kept us motivated to make more.  Now, I think we play to each other\u0080\u0099s strengths.

After ending up on the wrong side of the tracks a few times, they were finally pointed in the direction of Virginia-Highlands and found a few bars willing to take a chance on them. \"We'll give you a shot as long as your dog stops begging for leftovers on our patio\" was the cautious approval they needed to get the brand rolling.\r\n\r\nSweetWater's second and current location is in Midtown Atlanta, adjacent to Ansley Park, in the Armour Circle Industrial Park just off of Piedmont and Monroe. The boys saved all of their pennies to buy the 25,000 square feet of brewing goodness and smack in the middle of all the action. Since the company began we've wanted to be closer to our homes, the bars and stores that sell our beer, and all the good folks that drink it. Fortunately seven years of great growth gave the company that opportunity. We learned a lot from that location and left all those mistakes behind as we built our new home. SweetWater Brewing Company has been here since 2004 and it feels good to be settled in. Our new home has enough capacity to brew 100,000 barrels of beer a year (A few more years at this rate.)","website":"http:\/\/www.sweetwaterbrew.com\/","established":"1997","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TMc6H2\/upload_3il9e7-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TMc6H2\/upload_3il9e7-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TMc6H2\/upload_3il9e7-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TMc6H2\/upload_3il9e7-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TMc6H2\/upload_3il9e7-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:59:40","locations":[{"id":"MfINpl","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"195 Ottley Drive","locality":"Atlanta","region":"Georgia","postalCode":"30324","phone":"404-691-2537","website":"http:\/\/www.sweetwaterbrew.com\/","latitude":33.808102,"longitude":-84.38119,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1997","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"jkoAEQ","name":"Hop Haze Imperial IPA","nameDisplay":"Hop Haze Imperial IPA","description":"Hazy, golden Imperial India Pale Ale.","abv":"9","ibu":"90","glasswareId":5,"styleId":31,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/jkoAEQ\/upload_K6xeT4-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/jkoAEQ\/upload_K6xeT4-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/jkoAEQ\/upload_K6xeT4-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-04 13:31:15","updateDate":"2016-05-19 10:03:33","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"style":{"id":31,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ale","shortName":"Imperial IPA","description":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma.
