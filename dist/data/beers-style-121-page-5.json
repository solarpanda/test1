From the explorers of the 1700s through the Gold Rush, many a thirsty Alaskan has been able to enjoy locally made beers.\r\n\r\nIn 1986, 28-year-olds Marcy and Geoff Larson reignited that tradition when they opened the Alaskan Brewing Company, the 67th brewery in the country and the first brewery in Juneau since Prohibition. Alaskan beers reflect many of the same characteristics of beers that were brewed here during the gold rush era. From the historically based Alaskan Amber recipe to alder-smoked malts and Sitka spruce tips, Alaskan beers reflect Juneau's local brewing history and innovation.\r\n\r\nMarcy and Geoff were drawn to the beauty and adventure of Alaska, but finding a livelihood that would allow them to stay was a challenge. \"Why not start a brewery?\" a friend suggested. Other than the extreme financial and logistical challenges of brewing beer in the Last Frontier, they couldn't think of why not.\r\n\r\nMaybe the idea wasn't so far-fetched. After all, Geoff was a chemical engineer and a homebrewer and was married to Marcy, an adventure-seeking accountant and aspiring bush pilot. Together they brought a unique skill set to the task of opening a brewery in Alaska.\r\n\r\nWhile researching brewing in Alaska, Marcy unearthed shipping records from Douglas City Brewing Co. (1899-1907) that listed ingredients for its popular beers and a newspaper article that described the way it was brewed. Geoff homebrewed a batch of the Gold Rush-era brew and they could see what made it so popular. That beer is now known as Alaskan Amber.\r\n\r\nIn December 1986, Alaskan Brewing Co. officially began operations when Geoff, Marcy and 10 volunteers spent 12 hours hand packaging the first 253 cases of Alaskan Amber for distribution in Juneau, Alaska. From that very humble beginning, Alaskan Brewing Co. has grown to become the most award-winning craft brewery in the history of the Great American Beer Festival and expanded distribution to 14 states.","website":"http:\/\/www.alaskanbeer.com","established":"1986","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/VPHkaP\/upload_psVrqV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/VPHkaP\/upload_psVrqV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/VPHkaP\/upload_psVrqV-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/VPHkaP\/upload_psVrqV-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/VPHkaP\/upload_psVrqV-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:43","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:38:23","locations":[{"id":"krIs45","name":"Main Location","streetAddress":"5429 Shaune Dr","locality":"Juneau","region":"Alaska","postalCode":"99801-9540","phone":"907-780-5866","website":"http:\/\/www.alaskanbeer.com\/","latitude":58.3570171,"longitude":-134.4893459,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1986","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:43","updateDate":"2015-12-03 19:08:04","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"ZY9wxK","name":"Pumpkin Ale","nameDisplay":"Pumpkin Ale","styleId":121,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/ZY9wxK\/upload_NFf7Rr-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/ZY9wxK\/upload_NFf7Rr-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/ZY9wxK\/upload_NFf7Rr-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-10-04 14:14:18","updateDate":"2015-12-17 18:49:47","style":{"id":121,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Pumpkin Beer","shortName":"Pumpkin Beer","description":"Pumpkin beers are any beers using pumpkins (Cucurbito pepo) as an adjunct in either mash, kettle, primary or secondary fermentation, providing obvious (ranging from subtle to intense), yet harmonious, qualities.

Bohemian immigrants brought skilled craftsmen to erect Kewaunee County\u2019s first sizable building.\r\n\r\nBeers were produced under the supervision of the head brewmaster, Henry Schmiling, the great- great-great-great uncle of the current owners. The Civil War veteran sold barrels of Wisconsin craft beers by horse and sleigh, rail, and the schooner, \u201cWhisky Pete.\u201d Schmiling\u2019s Ahnapee Lager was known far and wide for its Wisconsin-made quality. Hops blight put the original brewery out of business in 1886.\r\n\r\nA new chapter in the brewery\u2019s history began in the summer of 2013. Fueled by the dreams of our General Manager and Head Brewer, Nick Calaway, we picked up where Henry left off. This time Wisconsin craft beers are produced in small batches and feature full-flavored beer, some with aging potential, served in the Tap Room two doors down from von Stiehl winery at 105 Navarino Street.","website":"http:\/\/vonstiehl.com\/","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/yFgliy\/upload_vAiLpQ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/yFgliy\/upload_vAiLpQ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/yFgliy\/upload_vAiLpQ-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/yFgliy\/upload_vAiLpQ-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/yFgliy\/upload_vAiLpQ-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-11-10 02:09:12","updateDate":"2016-07-04 22:51:19","locations":[{"id":"aNU3n7","name":"Tap Room","streetAddress":"105 Navarino St","locality":"Algoma","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"54201","phone":"(920) 785-0822","website":"http:\/\/vonstiehl.com\/","latitude":44.6090617,"longitude":-87.4351322,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-11-10 02:11:11","updateDate":"2015-12-03 19:17:45","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"JkRBqx","name":"Pumpkin Ale","nameDisplay":"Pumpkin Ale","description":"Availability: September\u2013October\r\n\r\nAdding organic baby bear pumpkins to malt and hops makes this truly a local farm to brewhouse collaboration.
