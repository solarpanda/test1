With 2 offerings currently distributed throughout the state, Back Forty is the only Alabama based brewery that can be found anywhere from Muscle Shoals to Mobile.\r\n\r\nThe name Back Forty Beer Company is basically a reference to the back 40 acres of the farm. Tradionally the \"Back 40\" of a farm is the most challenging to maintain, but also produces some of the best yields due to the rich content of the earth. Likewise, Alabama was one of the last States in The Union to update it's outdated beer laws (MS is the only one left), and now it's time to reap those yields.\r\n\r\nThe craft beer market in Alabama has a lot of room to grow, and we plan on doing everything we can to make that happen. Our main goal is to focus on the local community and support other small business owners while offering up our tasty flavors for the people of Alabama. \r\n\r\nThe company is founded in Alabama, and just about every aspect of this business is supported by Alabama based suppliers. We've worked with a Design firm out of Athens, AL on our label and logos, our attorney is in Birmingham, our accountant is in Dothan, AL, our shirts are printed in Huntsville and our Brewmaster is out of Montgomery, AL. \r\n\r\nWe've been working with Jamie Ray (A nationally recognized Brewmaster who has won several medals at the Great American Beer Festival in Denver, CO), for over a year on our first offering, \"Naked Pig Pale Ale\". And we have several ideas in the works for additional year round offerings in the coming months. We're looking forward to producing some great beers that Alabamian's have never tasted before. Once things get up and running, we'll start releasing some seasonal offerings, one-time offerings, limited edition batches, etc. That's what we're really excited about.\r\n\r\nThe only aspect of this operation that isn't planted firmly in Alabama soil, is the production and packaging. We had to go to another craft brewery in a neighboring state for our first production batches. This is partially due to the enormous start-up costs associated with building a complete brewery operation from scratch. But it's also given us the opportunity to support another regional micro-brewery while we get up and running.","website":"http:\/\/www.backfortybeer.com\/","established":"2009","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/KkUzjZ\/upload_OtE4O6-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/KkUzjZ\/upload_OtE4O6-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/KkUzjZ\/upload_OtE4O6-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/KkUzjZ\/upload_OtE4O6-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/KkUzjZ\/upload_OtE4O6-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:06:39","locations":[{"id":"lAcrbq","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"200 North 6th St.","locality":"Gadsden","region":"Alabama","postalCode":"35901","phone":"256-467-4912","website":"http:\/\/www.backfortybeer.com\/","latitude":34.015484,"longitude":-86.005585,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2009","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"s9IrCo","name":"Tryst Coffee Stout","nameDisplay":"Tryst Coffee Stout","abv":"4.4","styleId":123,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-26 17:08:31","updateDate":"2015-02-26 17:08:31","style":{"id":123,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Coffee-Flavored Beer","shortName":"Coffee Beer","description":"Coffee beers use coffee in any of its forms other than or in addition to hops to create a distinct (ranging from subtle to intense) character.

Driven by a desire for a quality, local product that would complement and diversify the already existing pub's style and reputation, Larry and Peter knew they would have to focus on producing a high quality product if it was going to be a success.  Knowing his beer knowledge and passion for the family business in which he grew up, Larry and Peter soon brought Larry's son Andrew into the conversation.  Beginning in a consulting roll, Andrew soon decided it was time to come back into the fold and asked his father and uncle for an opportunity to rejoin the family business in a full-time position.  In the coming year as business at the pub rolled on and continued to grow, so too did the brewery project.  Moving from an idea spoken about \u201coff the clock\u201d to a plan developed in a weekly owner's meeting, Geaghan Brothers Brewing Company began to take shape.  The project received a major boost in the most unlikely of circumstances when Larry, attending a local funeral, made contact with Sarah Courtney, a woman who grew up with Larry's oldest son Thomas.  Sarah and her husband Jason had spent the past 15 years working full-time in brewpub and microbrewery settings.  Jason had progressed from homebrewer to assistant brewer to head brewer and in 2002 had a very successful showing at the Great American Beer Festival, receiving the brewpub category brewmaster of the year honors.  As Larry, Peter and Andrew continued conversations and expressed their desire to build a small-scale brewery in Bangor, Jason and Sarah also expressed their interest in moving back to the Bangor area.  In time, with many conversations and meetings, both desires began to take shape.  With many options available to them, Jason and Sarah decided an opportunity to have a foundational and long-term impact on and relationship with a truly local brewery in Bangor, Maine was exactly what they were looking for.  In December 2011 the idea became a reality.  The Geaghan Family, together with award winning brewer Jason Courtney, have begun pouring pints of locally craft brewed beer from Geaghan Brothers Brewing Company exclusively at Geaghan's Pub.","website":"http:\/\/www.geaghanspub.com","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jmyqSv\/upload_Fwpywr-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jmyqSv\/upload_Fwpywr-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jmyqSv\/upload_Fwpywr-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jmyqSv\/upload_Fwpywr-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jmyqSv\/upload_Fwpywr-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-10 18:56:21","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:42:57","locations":[{"id":"oN5ry0","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"570 Main Street","locality":"Bangor","region":"Maine","postalCode":"04401","phone":"207-945-3730","website":"http:\/\/www.geaghanspub.com","latitude":44.786998,"longitude":-68.777343,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-10 19:02:53","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"TTwiff","name":"White Lightning","nameDisplay":"White Lightning","description":"White Lightening is a blend of Revival Imperial Stout & White Electric Coffee.","abv":"8.5","styleId":123,"isOrganic":"Y","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-07-08 19:01:02","updateDate":"2015-07-08 19:01:02","style":{"id":123,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Coffee-Flavored Beer","shortName":"Coffee Beer","description":"Coffee beers use coffee in any of its forms other than or in addition to hops to create a distinct (ranging from subtle to intense) character.
