It should be brewed with at least 30 percent rye malt, and hop rates will be low. A banana -like fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels; phenolic, clove-like characteristics should also be perceived. Color is straw to dark amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. If this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. If the beer is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa\/chocolate or light caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor\/aroma profile. As in the lighter colored versions, diacetyl should not be perceived.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"15","abvMin":"4.9","abvMax":"5.5","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"25","ogMin":"1.047","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:17"},"breweries":[{"id":"fRAz84","name":"Tap & Screw Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Tap & Screw","description":"Tap & Screw brewery is Cincinnati's first microbrewery on the west side, featuring on premise brewed beer, freshly made food, and local wines.","website":"http:\/\/www.tapandscrew.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/fRAz84\/upload_WfRcVm-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/fRAz84\/upload_WfRcVm-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/fRAz84\/upload_WfRcVm-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/fRAz84\/upload_WfRcVm-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/fRAz84\/upload_WfRcVm-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-06-30 21:15:05","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:11:53","locations":[{"id":"RcIs00","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"5060 Crookshank Rd","locality":"Cincinnati","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45238","phone":"(513) 451-1763","website":"http:\/\/www.tapandscrew.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  11:00am - 11:00pm\nTue:  11:00am - 11:00pm\nWed:  11:00am - 11:00pm\nThu:  11:00am - 1:00am\nFri:  11:00am - 2:30am\nSat:  11:00am - 2:30am\nSun:  11:00am - 11:00pm\n\n","latitude":39.1281581,"longitude":-84.6077061,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-06-30 21:16:52","updateDate":"2015-06-30 21:16:52","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
