With a focus on the revival of artisan brewing, we strive to create the highest quality products available.\r\n\r\nBrewing techniques as timeless as beer itself are used to create a uniquely handmade product. We craft the finest possible beer in small batches normally not found in the industry today which is typically dominated by mega mergers of international breweries. Is this difficult and more time consuming? Yes. Does it require more manual labor? Yes. Is it worth it? Unequivocally, YES. As beer is a \u201cliving, breathing\u201d product made from precise strains of active yeast cultures, it just makes good sense to nurture the product in very manageable small batches. We believe that the extra care and attention devoted to each batch produces the best possible result and you as our friends deserve no less.\r\n\r\nWe hope that you will have the opportunity to experience the limited quantities of hand crafted beer that we produce in Charlotte. When you do, please notice the complexities of the aroma, the silkiness of its body, and the explosion of flavors as the grains merge artfully with the yeast cultures and noble hops blended meticulously for each variety. Join us in celebrating the pleasures of hand crafted beers and life in the Queen City finally merged into this moment in time and allow yourself the pleasure of enjoying a uniquely Charlotte experience.","website":"http:\/\/fourfriendsbrewing.com\/","established":"2007","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/hcCgPK\/upload_470DWs-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/hcCgPK\/upload_470DWs-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/hcCgPK\/upload_470DWs-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/hcCgPK\/upload_470DWs-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/hcCgPK\/upload_470DWs-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:05:51","locations":[{"id":"amIfT7","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"10913 C Office Park Drive","locality":"Charlotte","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"28273","website":"http:\/\/fourfriendsbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Saturday: 3pm - 7pm","latitude":35.12048,"longitude":-80.9595499,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2007","yearClosed":"2014","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Wu4hy8","name":"Radeau Red Ale","nameDisplay":"Radeau Red Ale","description":"Cooper's Cave Ale Company's flagship ale is an Irish Red Ale.

That means Euopean styles, but with a slight Southern interpretation.\r\nThanks to Free the Hops and the change in Alabama's formerly restrictive beer laws, creativity in brewing has come to Alabama.\r\n\r\nAt Yellowhammer, head brewer Keith Yager draws inspiration from both Belgian and German brewing traditions. An accomplished home brewer since 1995, Yager has designed numerous seasonal and specialty batches, from the Dark Hammer Belgian Quad to the UberAlt sticke ale. Other recurring ales are more experimental, blending styles, as with Tobacco Road, an imperial amber designed to complement a good cigar, or the occasional Lonesome Hop series, which spotlights the character of an individual hop. Yellowhammer is Yager's first commercial undertaking.\r\n\r\nYellowhammer Brewing opened on Oct. 16, 2010 with the best-selling Belgian white ale and the IPA. Other staples sold throughout the year include a German style altbier and the Miracle Worker, a potent Belgian tripel.","website":"http:\/\/www.yellowhammerbrewery.com\/","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BI8mE7\/upload_Kf31WU-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BI8mE7\/upload_Kf31WU-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BI8mE7\/upload_Kf31WU-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BI8mE7\/upload_Kf31WU-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BI8mE7\/upload_Kf31WU-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:13","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:23:20","locations":[{"id":"4V6C7Y","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2406 Clinton Avenue","locality":"West Huntsville","region":"Alabama","postalCode":"35805","phone":"256-975-5950","website":"http:\/\/www.yellowhammerbrewery.com\/","latitude":34.722525,"longitude":-86.603703,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2010","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:13","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"8ikyKx","name":"Red","nameDisplay":"Red","description":"Our newest beer to fill our six-pack is Red\u2014an Irish Style Ale.\r\n\r\nRed is a traditionally styled Irish Ale with a hefty helping of malt, a little taste of roasted barley and some wonderful red color from the crystal malt, classically hopped with Fuggles and Kent Goldings.\r\n\r\nYou will really enjoy this winter warmer any time of the year.","abv":"4.4","glasswareId":5,"styleId":22,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/8ikyKx\/upload_rI41sV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/8ikyKx\/upload_rI41sV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/8ikyKx\/upload_rI41sV-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-21 12:58:56","updateDate":"2015-12-17 11:35:47","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"style":{"id":22,"categoryId":2,"category":{"id":2,"name":"Irish Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Irish-Style Red Ale","shortName":"Irish Red","description":"Irish-style red ales range from light red-amber-copper to light brown in color.

Ever since the beginnings of the American Beer Renaissance, I have wanted to brew my own great tasting beer and make it available to the beer drinking public and help people learn about and appreciate beer. Coming from Oshkosh, Wisconsin, beer brewing is in my veins.\r\n\r\nTwelve years ago my wonderful wife bought me the \"everything but the kitchen sink\" homebrew kit and it all started. After a few extract brew sessions, I built a 15 gallon brew sculpture and graduated to all-grain brewing, and things really got serious. Now after over 200 brews, BCB is in business!\r\n\r\nThe brewery is small, we call it a Nano-Brewery, we are hidden in the middle of 38 acres of woods in the heart of North Carolina. Most everything is recycled or made in-house. The Brew-House is an old 20' steel cargo container, the Beer-Garden brew patio is recycled flagstone and granite, nestled under spreading oaks and pines, our cooling water is stored rain water from a cistern, the chickens just love the spent mash. All the ingredients are as fresh as possible, some are even home grown. American malts, hops, and yeast are the mainstay of our beers. The water is from our 450' well and is just as pure and clean as can be. Our small batch brewing lets us assure you that each keg or bottle of beer will be as fresh and wonderful as though we were brewing it for ourselves to drink.","website":"http:\/\/www.bearcreekbrews.com\/","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/9GewxD\/upload_lRNESO-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/9GewxD\/upload_lRNESO-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/9GewxD\/upload_lRNESO-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/9GewxD\/upload_lRNESO-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/9GewxD\/upload_lRNESO-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-21 12:55:26","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:52:57","locations":[{"id":"EfLTd6","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"10538 NC 902 Hwy","locality":"Bear Creek","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"27207","phone":"(919) 200-3930","website":"http:\/\/www.bearcreekbrews.com\/","latitude":35.6518126,"longitude":-79.3329623,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"nano","locationTypeDisplay":"Nano Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2014-03-21 12:56:05","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"qz4HmX","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"10538 NC 902 Hwy","locality":"Bear Creek","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"27207","phone":"(919) 200-3930","website":"http:\/\/www.bearcreekbrews.com\/","latitude":35.6518126,"longitude":-79.3329623,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"nano","locationTypeDisplay":"Nano Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-21 12:56:06","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Zz9Erp","name":"Red Ale","nameDisplay":"Red Ale","glasswareId":5,"styleId":22,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/Zz9Erp\/upload_zC1FkJ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/Zz9Erp\/upload_zC1FkJ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/Zz9Erp\/upload_zC1FkJ-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:44:03","updateDate":"2015-12-16 12:27:10","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"style":{"id":22,"categoryId":2,"category":{"id":2,"name":"Irish Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Irish-Style Red Ale","shortName":"Irish Red","description":"Irish-style red ales range from light red-amber-copper to light brown in color.

Jason Hendricks and Jason Schlaff met in the fall of  2009.  They didn\u2019t know then that their friendship would bloom, but when it did, a brewery would be the flower.\r\n\r\nThe Jasons started humbly with a five gallon pot, a homebrew starter kit, and an idea of what good should be.  The first brew was just ok, an American Ale extract kit that did not allow for any artistry.  They quickly realized they needed to switch things up in order to attain the flavors they wanted.  So, the two amateurs ventured into the world of all-grain brewing.  The first mash tun, a cooler, the first brew, a porter.  Jason and Jason had their first failure.  \r\n\r\nPoor taste and terrible color ruined their tongues but not their spirit.  They could do much much better.   Schlaff, an avid reader and researcher, dove head first into every book he could find.  Hendricks scoured the internet and talked to every expert he could find.  Armed with brains full of knowledge the two gents embarked on the brewing adventure again.  \r\n\r\nThe second beer, a blonde ale, crafted with the newfound comprehension they acquired.  After a two weeks of eager anticipation, success!  The Jasons now had the knowledge, the drive, and the skill.  Each ale after that was instant hit among their friends and family.  Gary Schlaff, Jason\u2019s distinguished father, joined the endeavor in 2013.  Gary, a marketing genius, is nearing retirement and has decided to throw his business knowledge into the mix.\r\n\r\nThe brewery itself will not serve or prepare food.  Patrons will be allowed to bring in outside food, as well as have food delivered to them at the brewery.\r\n\r\nWe strive to be as sustainable and as local as possible.  The brewhouse and fermenters will be purchased for Psycho Brew LLC of Greenville, MI.  Our hops will be purchased from the many growers in Michigan.  Our spent grain will be sold to local farmers instead of going to waste in a landfill.  As a side project, we will also used the spent grain to made organic dog treats.","website":"http:\/\/fbcbrewing.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ohbgYE\/upload_WwIcxm-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ohbgYE\/upload_WwIcxm-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ohbgYE\/upload_WwIcxm-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ohbgYE\/upload_WwIcxm-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ohbgYE\/upload_WwIcxm-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-11-24 00:48:05","updateDate":"2016-04-10 21:15:30","locations":[{"id":"fSqavF","name":"Farmington Brewing Company","streetAddress":"33336 Grand River","locality":"Farmington","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"48336","phone":"(248) 957-9543","website":"http:\/\/fbcbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Wed:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\nThu:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\nFri:  4:00pm - 11:00pm\nSat:  2:00pm - 11:00pm\nSun:  2:00pm - 9:00pm\n\n","latitude":42.464946,"longitude":-83.375958,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2014","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-11-24 00:51:59","updateDate":"2016-04-10 21:15:14","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"GNz66x","name":"Red Ale","nameDisplay":"Red Ale","styleId":22,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:44:03","updateDate":"2015-05-12 17:22:05","style":{"id":22,"categoryId":2,"category":{"id":2,"name":"Irish Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Irish-Style Red Ale","shortName":"Irish Red","description":"Irish-style red ales range from light red-amber-copper to light brown in color.

We had no idea what we started. Customers loved our beer! By 1994, we outgrew the original site (now our 100-seat brew pub) and moved up the road to a larger facility to keep up with demand.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe brew over 160,000 barrels of beer and 10,000 barrels of root beer in our state-of-the-art brewing facility. Our lagers and ales are brewed in small batches, hand-crafted by a team of dedicated workers with only the highest ideals of quality. This pride, along with our brewing process, is what creates our great brews.\r\n\r\nWe are privately owned and operated by local shareholders, many who have been with us since day one.\r\n\r\nAbita uses only the finest ingredients \u2013 British and North American malted barley, German and American yeast strains, Pacific Northwest hops and the pure artesian water of Abita Springs.\r\n\r\nIn Abita Springs, we are blessed with the purest of water. Drawn from our deep wells, our pristine water is not altered in any way.\r\n\r\nAbita Beer has no preservatives, additives or stabilizers and is cold filtered. The result is beer that is the finest and freshest tasting as proven by our loyal customers and great chefs of the south who use Abita Beer in their recipes.","website":"http:\/\/www.abita.com\/","established":"1986","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BBE5WM\/upload_6HsKvN-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BBE5WM\/upload_6HsKvN-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BBE5WM\/upload_6HsKvN-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BBE5WM\/upload_6HsKvN-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BBE5WM\/upload_6HsKvN-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:43","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:38:18","locations":[{"id":"d8IJKF","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"PO Box 1510","locality":"Abita Springs","region":"Louisiana","postalCode":"70420","phone":"800-737-2311","latitude":30.4785257,"longitude":-90.0375755,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"office","locationTypeDisplay":"Office","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1986","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:43","updateDate":"2015-12-03 19:13:14","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"PdSE1h","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"21084 Louisiana 36","locality":"Covington","region":"Louisiana","postalCode":"70433","phone":"9858933143","latitude":30.482138,"longitude":-90.055185,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-09-29 14:34:50","updateDate":"2015-12-03 19:13:30","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"1xB2B8","name":"Brewpub","streetAddress":"72011 Holly Street","locality":"Abita Springs","region":"Louisiana","postalCode":"70420","phone":"(985) 892-5837","website":"http:\/\/www.abitabrewpub.com\/","latitude":30.4787911,"longitude":-90.0392975,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2004","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-09-29 14:36:40","updateDate":"2015-12-03 19:14:30","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"EOsuuz","name":"Red Ale","nameDisplay":"Red Ale","description":"This ale is made with a special roast of caramel malt, which gives it a lovely red hue and subtle caramel flavor.
