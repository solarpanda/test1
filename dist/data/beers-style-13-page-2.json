This results in a unique drinking experience each time a bottle is opened.\r\n\r\nHere at Draai Laag we like to cater to those that want something respectful of tradition, but ultimately different.  Those who are not satisfied drinking the norm.  Most importantly, we get our biggest enjoyment and fulfillment not from profit, but from your smile after the first sip.\r\n\r\nThis company was built on the dream of doing what we love and following our passion.

Rogue's first brewpub was located in Ashland, Oregon and was a 10bbl brewsystem. Rogue opened a second brewpub, 15bbl brewsystem, in May 1989 located in Newport, Oregon. Rogue closed its Ashland operation in 1997, after the great flood destroyed the place. In 1991, the 15bbl system, named Howard after John Maier's former boss, from the Newport brewpub was transferred across the bay to the current brewery and upgraded to a 30bbl system. In 1998 Rogue bought a 50bbl brewsystem, named Kobe. Kobe is the only brewsystem in use. Tours: We offer brewery tours every day at 3 pm (followed by a distillery tour at 4pm). Go up to the bar inside the brewery (Brewers on the Bay) and check in with the bartender and the tour will commence. Please call ahead if you have a large group and or to verify the tour time...Brewer's on the Bay phone is 541-867-3664.

Initially started in a barn on old farmland near Corcoran Vineyards, this combination became Virginia\u2019s first vineyard \/ brewery combo in the state. After several years of growing business it was realized that there was not enough room to stay as demand for the beer grew. In early 2014 the brewery was moved to Purcellville Virginia which is about 6 miles from where it started.\r\n\r\nCorcoran Brewing Company has produced over thirty three distinct beers since opening day. We strive to create both traditional beer types as well as creating unique experiences with experimental beers. On any given day we have twelve beers on tap ranging from Kolch style, American Pale Ales, IPA\u2019s, Imperial IPA\u2019s, Stouts, Bourbon barrel aged, port barrel aged and more.

The brewery was Aurora, Colorado\u2019s first when owners Kevin DeLange and Michelle Reding opened with a 7 BBL brewhouse in a 900-square-foot space next their original business The Brew Hut, a homebrew supply shop, in 2005. They named the brewery as a nod to Kevin\u2019s love of nautical history.\r\n\r\nDry Dock expanded in 2009, and again in 2011. Now the brewery runs a 7 BBL brewhouse including a tasting room with 180 seats and 16 taps at its original location at 15120 E. Hampden Avenue which is called South Dock.\r\n\r\nIn 2013, Dry Dock nearly quadrupled its production numbers, jumping from 3,200 barrels in 2012 to 12,000 barrels in one year. This increase came with the purchase of a 30,000-square-foot production facility, North Dock, at 2801 Tower Road. At North Dock, Dry Dock has the capacity to expand to brew more than 30,000 barrels a year, and cans its flagship line of beers, including the Amber Ale, Hop Abomination, Hefeweizen, and Apricot Blonde.\r\n\r\nIn September of 2014, Dry Dock opened the Canoe Room, a four-tap tasting room inside of its North Dock facility. The tasting room, which in addition to draft beer, serves Dry Dock\u2019s canned offerings. The room was once the storage area for The Boy Scouts of America Aurora chapter\u2019s canoes and the area gained the nickname \u201cCanoe Room,\u201d which stuck.\r\n\r\nDry Dock established itself early on by word-of-mouth, and put itself on the map when it won a gold 2006 World Beer Cup (only 6 months after the tiny brewery opened) for its HMS Victory ESB (now Dry Dock\u2019s Amber Ale). Dry Dock has since been the recipient of 20 GABF\u00ae medals, the prestigious Brewers Association\u2019s Small Brewery of the Year award, and five World Beer Cup\u00ae awards.","website":"http:\/\/www.drydockbrewing.com\/","established":"2005","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/fn89yQ\/upload_HXm8qn-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/fn89yQ\/upload_HXm8qn-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/fn89yQ\/upload_HXm8qn-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/fn89yQ\/upload_HXm8qn-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/fn89yQ\/upload_HXm8qn-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:07:28","locations":[{"id":"LWD44j","name":"South Dock","streetAddress":"15120 E.

Also referred to as a winter warmer, this beer balances dark fruit flavors against a background chocolate malt and a slightly sweet finish. It is meant to provide depth of flavor while having a surprisingly clean finish. The effect should be warming, due to the high alcohol, though never losing its balanced drinkability. A great pairing with a variety of foods ranging from roasted meats to caramel desert dishes.\r\n\r\nImperial City Olde Ale takes its name from a piece of Birmingham Alabama\u2019s brewing past. Imperial City Brewing Co. was started in 1911 and was in a race to be the largest brewery in the county. Unfortunately the state of Alabama prohibited alcohol in 1915 and the brewery ended before it even began. Imperial City Olde Ale celebrates the rich brewing history of Birmingham, AL \u2013 both past, present, and future. Remembering Imperial City Brewing Co. reminds us of the trimtab potential legislation has on an industry that brings happiness and culture to millions of people.

Think of the Queen Mary [an ocean liner]\u2014 the whole ship goes by and then comes the rudder. And there's a tiny thing at the edge of the rudder called a trim tab. It's a miniature rudder. Just moving the little trim tab builds a low pressure that pulls the rudder around. Takes almost no effort at all. So I said that the little individual can be a trim tab. Society thinks it's going right by you, that it's left you all together. But if you're doing dynamic things mentally, the fact is that you can just put your foot out like that and the whole big ship of state is going to go.
