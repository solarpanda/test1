Four double sized fermentors were installed in an old garage behind the current brewery. A cold box was erected adjacent to the garage and a bottling machine with a nice labeler are housed there too. There is a small barrel shed on the shady, north side of the garage.","website":"http:\/\/www.alpinebeerco.com\/","established":"2002","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/vDxSPd\/upload_xSpAaB-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/vDxSPd\/upload_xSpAaB-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/vDxSPd\/upload_xSpAaB-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/vDxSPd\/upload_xSpAaB-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/vDxSPd\/upload_xSpAaB-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:38:34","locations":[{"id":"AfyZtJ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2351 Alpine Boulevard","locality":"Alpine","region":"California","postalCode":"91901","phone":"619-445-2337","website":"http:\/\/www.alpinebeerco.com\/","latitude":32.8351688,"longitude":-116.7626655,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2002","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2015-12-03 19:11:21","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"WCOboT","name":"Unda Cova Brudda","nameDisplay":"Unda Cova Brudda","description":"Imperial Rye India Black Ale. \r\nBalanced rye, roasty malts, and hops bitterness and flavor make this one a great evening sipper, the high ABV is hidden in the symphony of flavor.","abv":"9.75","ibu":"89.6","glasswareId":14,"srmId":28,"availableId":1,"styleId":41,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/WCOboT\/upload_eRlsev-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/WCOboT\/upload_eRlsev-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/WCOboT\/upload_eRlsev-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"Deep chocolate dessert.
