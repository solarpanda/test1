Er steht gegen\u00fcber der Pfarrkirche, wo einst schon die R\u00f6mer siedelten. Denn Grinzing hat Tradition: ein Vorort zu Wien, eine Landpartie f\u00fcr das B\u00fcrgertum, ein bewahrtes Dorf in der Gro\u00dfstadt. In seiner bewegten Geschichte konnte Grinzing stets das Wahrhaftige erhalten und das Neue behutsam integrieren. So blieben die einzigartige Landschaft, der hervorragende Wein und die Liebe zum guten Essen. \r\n\r\nWir finden das gut.\r\n\r\nIm Zeichen dieser Philosophie bieten wir unseren G\u00e4sten \u2013 ob privat oder Firmen \u2013 heute eine wahrhaft gro\u00dfe Bandbreite. Etwa an Kulinarischem: von Alt Wiener Heurigen-Klassikern bis zu saisonalen Spezialit\u00e4ten und unsere Weine vom eigenen Winzerbetrieb Martinshof. Oder an Ideen f\u00fcr Feiern: von Heurigenmusik bis zur Anfahrt mit einer Oldtimer-Tramway, von der privaten Weinverkostung mit Freya und Michael Martin, den Winzern des Martinshofs, bis zu Festen im Freien oder im wundersch\u00f6nen Kellergew\u00f6lbe. Apropos: Wir sind ein bisschen stolz auf unsere vielf\u00e4ltigen R\u00e4umlichkeiten. Denn manchmal braucht man eine lauschige Nische f\u00fcr zwei. An anderen Abenden einen ruhigen Tisch f\u00fcr ein paar Gesch\u00e4ftspartner. Mal feiert man Omas Geburtstag zu drei\u00dfigst, einmal das Fest seines Lebens mit 400 Freunden. Ist uns alles recht.

With a capacity of only about 150 barrels per year, the brewery, now with a third owner on board, quickly outgrew the little farm shed converted into a brewhouse.\r\n\r\nHoping to remain in the Dunn\/St. Croix counties area, the company looked for a suitable place to relocate, but came up empty handed. Then opportunity knocked in the form of a phone call one evening from their friend in Black River Falls, Pioneer brewing's brewmaster Todd Krueger. The brewery was for sale.\r\n\r\nIn March of 2004 the combined forces of the two breweries officially formed the new Sand Creek Brewing Co. of Black River Falls, Wisconsin.","website":"http:\/\/www.sandcreekbrewing.com\/","established":"1999","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gsADrL\/upload_RPFu23-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gsADrL\/upload_RPFu23-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gsADrL\/upload_RPFu23-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gsADrL\/upload_RPFu23-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gsADrL\/upload_RPFu23-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:56:58","locations":[{"id":"TSKxwK","name":"Sand Creek Brewing Co","streetAddress":"320 Pierce St","extendedAddress":"Box 187","locality":"Black River Falls","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"54615","phone":"(715) 284-7553","website":"http:\/\/www.sandcreekbrewing.com\/","latitude":44.2830622,"longitude":-90.7913227,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1998","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2015-12-04 17:57:24","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"W1tAIh","name":"Henrich's Hard Lemonade","nameDisplay":"Henrich's Hard Lemonade","description":"A light Malt Lemonaide","abv":"4.2","srmId":3,"availableId":6,"styleId":161,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/W1tAIh\/upload_LXXK5A-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/W1tAIh\/upload_LXXK5A-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/W1tAIh\/upload_LXXK5A-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-05 20:18:22","updateDate":"2015-12-17 17:54:57","srm":{"id":3,"name":"3","hex":"FFCA5A"},"available":{"id":6,"name":"Summer","description":"Available during the summer months."},"style":{"id":161,"categoryId":14,"category":{"id":14,"name":"Malternative Beverages","description":"Malternative Beverages, also known as \"ready-to-drink\" beverages, are sweet, sometime carbonated, beverages that are low in alcohol.","createDate":"2014-07-10 14:11:26","updateDate":"2014-07-10 14:20:24"},"name":"Flavored Malt Beverage","shortName":"Flavored Malt Beverage","description":"Flavored malt beverages are brewery products that are different from traditional malt beverages like malt liquor, ales, and lagers in several aspects.
