Some have lent a hand in some way or another. They know what \u201cpour to the line\u201d means; they have been to every annual crawfish boil and some find the passion within themselves to put the Darkhorse name to skin\u2026still they barely understand the immature drawings created in the brewery\u2026 True patrons know the hard work the brewers put in to create and keep the Darkhorse name in the lead.\r\n \r\nSome things in life are easily read and some things keep you guessing. Should we take turns consuming garage sale items and vomiting them on the walls or should we follow the square, straight and narrow? Slip into the pub and look around. Go out and buy a six-pack, and read the holder the beer comes in. Read the back of your growler. When you\u2019re done, you\u2019ll either get it or you won\u2019t. No matter, as you\u2019re drinking some of the best fuckin\u2019 beer made in the great state of Michigan.

We've worked hard and are incredibly proud of the many successes we've enjoyed over the years. The Boston Beer Company has been cited as one of the best companies to work for by Boston Magazine, one of the Best Entry-Level Jobs by The Princeton Review, and our beers have won more awards than any other in history. Jim has been named an \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" by Inc. Magazine. Our brewers keep amazing us with innovative new brews, including Samuel Adams Utopias and our Samuel Adams Barrel Room Collection.\r\n\r\nJim has believed from the beginning that the more you know and understand about beer, the more you'll appreciate a beer like Samuel Adams Boston Lager. To begin that mission, all new employees go through intensive training on everything from ingredients, brewing, and beer styles, to taking care of the beer once it leaves the brewery. We're all beer lovers and protectors of the beer so we're trained how to identify off flavors and how to troubleshoot the causes. The passion for beer continues with an annual homebrew competition that we all take part in.\r\n\r\nOne of our wholesalers once asked Jim why he invested so much in training his people, when ultimately they might leave. Jim smiled and replied without hesitation: \"What if I didn't train them, and they stayed?\"\r\n\r\nEach year, usually in January, everyone gathers together. One of the highlights of the meeting is the beer trivia contest. With a culture so steeped in beer education and knowledge, winning is a pretty big deal. Recently, one of the hotel bartenders who was watching as the various teams arrived in costume with music and much enthusiasm and fanfare, said, \"I've always known Samuel Adams made the best beer in America, but now I see this is the greatest company in America.\" When you look around you see that The Boston Beer Company is a team of enthusiastic people who are passionate about beer and who really love coming to work every day to provide American drinkers with the best beer possible.\r\n\r\nThe Boston Beer Company, Inc. is a publicly-traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol, SAM.","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","established":"1984","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:24:45","locations":[{"id":"DF5YsC","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"30 Germania Street","locality":"Boston","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"02130","phone":"1-800-372-1131","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","latitude":42.314449,"longitude":-71.103365,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1984","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2015-12-02 19:22:03","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"MLUbXI","name":"Cincinnati","streetAddress":"1625 Central Parkway","locality":"Cincinnati","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45214","phone":"513-412-3200","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","latitude":39.1144986,"longitude":-84.5222061,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-12 13:10:57","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"XZ6L8a","name":"Production Brewery","streetAddress":"7880 Penn Drive","locality":"Breinigsville","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"18031","latitude":40.5759622,"longitude":-75.6290377,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2007","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-11-30 20:24:56","updateDate":"2015-12-02 19:22:03","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Y4Hzhn","name":"Santa Paws","nameDisplay":"Santa Paws","abv":"4.5","styleId":15,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-12-14 10:00:02","updateDate":"2015-12-17 19:54:01","style":{"id":15,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Scotch Ale","shortName":"Scotch Ale","description":"Scotch ales are overwhelmingly malty and full-bodied.

Brewer\u2019s Alley is proud to continue the long history of beer making in a town known for its deep appreciation of fine fermented spirits.\r\n\r\nBrewer\u2019s Alley was located on what is currently South Court Street. Beer Production ceased in 1901 when a large fire consumed the brewery of John Kuhn, who was the last in a long line of brewers to occupy space along the banks of Carroll Creek. For over 153 years, from the very beginning of Frederick County, Brewer\u2019s Alley was a fixture in the social and economic landscape of Frederick. Ninety-five years after leaving Frederick, Brewer\u2019s Alley is back!\r\n\r\nBrewer\u2019s Alley\u2019s location at 124 North Market Street is steeped in Frederick history. The first residents of Frederick held a lottery to raise money to build a town hall and market house on this location in 1765, which was completed in 1769. This structure served its purpose for over 100 years and was witness to the birth of Frederick as a city. The Market House spanned the Civil War, including the ransoming of the city by Confederate General Jubal Early.\r\n\r\nIn 1873, the bustling town of Frederick replaced the Market House with the \"new\" multifunctional offices, and provided space in the rear for the Frederick Farmer\u2019s Market. Later, the rear of the building was replaced by the present parking deck; the first of it\u2019s kind in town.\r\n\r\nAs the seat of city government the building was witness to Frederick\u2019s political history, and as an opera house and theatre it has been witness to much of Frederick\u2019s social and entertainment history. The building has hosted such diverse events as a Memorial Service for President McKinley in 1901, the Frederick debut of D.W. Griffith\u2019s film \"The Birth of a Nation\", and the Manhattan Opera Company\u2019s production of \"Madame Butterfly\", in 1926. It also hosted the popular American Legion fundraisers immediately after World War I, and the family pleasers the Mykle and Harden Fair Week Road Shows.\r\n\r\nBrewer\u2019s Alley has been fortunate in its efforts to preserve the elegance and glory of the old Opera House by being able to engage Salyer Studio Faux to faux decorate some of the original ceiling panels and columns in mimicked old Italian Sienna marble. The beautiful and captivating glass etching work and stained glass seen throughout the building done by Rusty and Sharon Rowland\u2019s Art in Glass Studio complements this fine craftsmanship. Their rendition of the hop vines on the brewery glass and the stain glass panels in the back dinning room was all done by hand and is a joy to behold.\r\n\r\nWe are most happy to oversee the building\u2019s latest transformation into the state-of-the-art brewery and restaurant. We hope you enjoy the history and ambiance of our location, as well as the brewery and dining experience.\r\n\r\nWe opened the doors in July of 1996 and have been serving great beers and wonderful meals to the masses ever since.","website":"http:\/\/www.brewers-alley.com","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wFeIiC\/upload_q7kWln-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wFeIiC\/upload_q7kWln-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wFeIiC\/upload_q7kWln-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wFeIiC\/upload_q7kWln-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wFeIiC\/upload_q7kWln-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:48","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:05:53","locations":[{"id":"Qs29uy","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"124 North Market Street","locality":"Frederick","region":"Maryland","postalCode":"21701","phone":"301-631-0089","website":"http:\/\/www.brewers-alley.com","latitude":39.4156043,"longitude":-77.4107676,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:48","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"RW6Da0","name":"Main Brewery","locality":"Laurel","region":"MD","postalCode":"20723","latitude":39.1426709,"longitude":-76.860565,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"restaurant","locationTypeDisplay":"Restaurant\/Ale House","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2016-03-14 17:43:05","updateDate":"2016-05-01 14:34:43","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"XSNKae","name":"Scotch Ale","nameDisplay":"Scotch Ale","description":"A strong, full-bodies brew with a smooth caramel finish and a high alcohol content.

Coming from Oshkosh, Wisconsin, beer brewing is in my veins.\r\n\r\nTwelve years ago my wonderful wife bought me the \"everything but the kitchen sink\" homebrew kit and it all started. After a few extract brew sessions, I built a 15 gallon brew sculpture and graduated to all-grain brewing, and things really got serious.

Most everything is recycled or made in-house. The Brew-House is an old 20' steel cargo container, the Beer-Garden brew patio is recycled flagstone and granite, nestled under spreading oaks and pines, our cooling water is stored rain water from a cistern, the chickens just love the spent mash. All the ingredients are as fresh as possible, some are even home grown. American malts, hops, and yeast are the mainstay of our beers. The water is from our 450' well and is just as pure and clean as can be. Our small batch brewing lets us assure you that each keg or bottle of beer will be as fresh and wonderful as though we were brewing it for ourselves to drink.","website":"http:\/\/www.bearcreekbrews.com\/","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/9GewxD\/upload_lRNESO-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/9GewxD\/upload_lRNESO-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/9GewxD\/upload_lRNESO-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/9GewxD\/upload_lRNESO-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/9GewxD\/upload_lRNESO-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-21 12:55:26","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:52:57","locations":[{"id":"EfLTd6","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"10538 NC 902 Hwy","locality":"Bear Creek","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"27207","phone":"(919) 200-3930","website":"http:\/\/www.bearcreekbrews.com\/","latitude":35.6518126,"longitude":-79.3329623,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"nano","locationTypeDisplay":"Nano Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2014-03-21 12:56:05","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"qz4HmX","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"10538 NC 902 Hwy","locality":"Bear Creek","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"27207","phone":"(919) 200-3930","website":"http:\/\/www.bearcreekbrews.com\/","latitude":35.6518126,"longitude":-79.3329623,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"nano","locationTypeDisplay":"Nano Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-21 12:56:06","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"KHMJHB","name":"Scotch Ale","nameDisplay":"Scotch Ale","description":"Brewed primarily for Michael Jackson\u2019s Rare Beer Club, but also available in limited quantities on tap at the Greenwich Union pub.\r\n\r\nAfter India Pale Ale and London Porter the third great British export beer was Scotch Ale.

With 2 offerings currently distributed throughout the state, Back Forty is the only Alabama based brewery that can be found anywhere from Muscle Shoals to Mobile.\r\n\r\nThe name Back Forty Beer Company is basically a reference to the back 40 acres of the farm. Tradionally the \"Back 40\" of a farm is the most challenging to maintain, but also produces some of the best yields due to the rich content of the earth. Likewise, Alabama was one of the last States in The Union to update it's outdated beer laws (MS is the only one left), and now it's time to reap those yields.\r\n\r\nThe craft beer market in Alabama has a lot of room to grow, and we plan on doing everything we can to make that happen. Our main goal is to focus on the local community and support other small business owners while offering up our tasty flavors for the people of Alabama. \r\n\r\nThe company is founded in Alabama, and just about every aspect of this business is supported by Alabama based suppliers. We've worked with a Design firm out of Athens, AL on our label and logos, our attorney is in Birmingham, our accountant is in Dothan, AL, our shirts are printed in Huntsville and our Brewmaster is out of Montgomery, AL. \r\n\r\nWe've been working with Jamie Ray (A nationally recognized Brewmaster who has won several medals at the Great American Beer Festival in Denver, CO), for over a year on our first offering, \"Naked Pig Pale Ale\". And we have several ideas in the works for additional year round offerings in the coming months. We're looking forward to producing some great beers that Alabamian's have never tasted before. Once things get up and running, we'll start releasing some seasonal offerings, one-time offerings, limited edition batches, etc. That's what we're really excited about.\r\n\r\nThe only aspect of this operation that isn't planted firmly in Alabama soil, is the production and packaging. We had to go to another craft brewery in a neighboring state for our first production batches. This is partially due to the enormous start-up costs associated with building a complete brewery operation from scratch. But it's also given us the opportunity to support another regional micro-brewery while we get up and running.","website":"http:\/\/www.backfortybeer.com\/","established":"2009","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/KkUzjZ\/upload_OtE4O6-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/KkUzjZ\/upload_OtE4O6-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/KkUzjZ\/upload_OtE4O6-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/KkUzjZ\/upload_OtE4O6-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/KkUzjZ\/upload_OtE4O6-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:06:39","locations":[{"id":"lAcrbq","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"200 North 6th St.","locality":"Gadsden","region":"Alabama","postalCode":"35901","phone":"256-467-4912","website":"http:\/\/www.backfortybeer.com\/","latitude":34.015484,"longitude":-86.005585,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2009","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"L77dUS","name":"Scotch Ale","nameDisplay":"Scotch Ale","abv":"7.2","styleId":15,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-03 16:14:14","updateDate":"2015-05-18 15:18:01","style":{"id":15,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Scotch Ale","shortName":"Scotch Ale","description":"Scotch ales are overwhelmingly malty and full-bodied.

Founder, Kenny Thacker, originally got into brewing beer as a business opportunity with a full-service homebrewing store, the Fermentation Trap.  Since that time, he has fallen in love with beer and brewing and felt compelled to do it professionally, and in 2012, Kenny opened Beer Hound Brewery.\r\n\r\nNot long after Beer Hound opened, friends & beer entrepreneurs Frank Becker & Rick Cash saw the potential in the great-tasting brews that were part of the Beer Hound lineup. They joined forces with Beer Hound Brewery and decided to bring the great tasting microbrews to the Town of Culpeper, Virginia.  In October of 2014, Beer Hound Brewery opened its doors as the first-ever brewery in Culpeper. Local and visiting beer enthusiasts descended upon the new establishment immediately and now the Beer Hound brand is a mainstay of the arts district in Downtown Culpeper.\r\n\r\nAll of the Beer Hound beers are named after famous hounds in movies and history, with an attempt to link the beer style to the hound. Beer Hound Brewery serves a variety of beer styles fresh daily, so stop by and enjoy a pint!","website":"http:\/\/www.beerhoundbrewery.com","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ZBXJCR\/upload_43NTnt-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ZBXJCR\/upload_43NTnt-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ZBXJCR\/upload_43NTnt-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ZBXJCR\/upload_43NTnt-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ZBXJCR\/upload_43NTnt-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-10-24 11:24:49","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:38:21","locations":[{"id":"u2ExM0","name":"Main Location","streetAddress":"201 Waters Place","extendedAddress":"#102","locality":"Culpeper","region":"Virginia","postalCode":"22701","phone":"(540) 317-5327","website":"http:\/\/www.beerhoundbrewery.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Tue:  11:00am - 6:00pm\nWed:  11:00am - 7:00pm\nThu:  11:00am - 7:00pm\nFri:  11:00am - 8:00pm\nSat:  10:00am - 8:00pm\nSun:  12:30pm - 6:00pm\n\nTue:11:00 am - 6:00 pm\r\nWed - Thu:11:00 am - 7:00 pm\r\nFri:11:00 am - 8:00 pm\r\nSat:10:00 am - 8:00 pm\r\nSun:12:30 pm - 6:00 pm","latitude":38.4719318,"longitude":-77.9943893,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"nano","locationTypeDisplay":"Nano Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-10-24 11:25:29","updateDate":"2015-04-28 14:18:14","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"J6pdG1","name":"Scottish","nameDisplay":"Scottish","abv":"5","ibu":"22","availableId":1,"styleId":15,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-11-06 23:24:57","updateDate":"2014-11-07 16:51:19","available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":15,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Scotch Ale","shortName":"Scotch Ale","description":"Scotch ales are overwhelmingly malty and full-bodied.
