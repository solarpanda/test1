The original house was located under what is now the lobby of the Marriott Hotel. Built in 1908 as a private residence for the Hamilton family, over the years it served as the University president\u2019s house, a boarding house and home to several fraternities. The name Gentle Ben\u2019s was chosen through a contest and the winner was a University professor who thought the manager looked like Dan Haggerty from the T.V. show Grizzly Adams whose co-star was a bear named Gentle Ben. That show was based on a man who roamed parts of Northern California in the 1920s and 30s. He had two bears, Benjamin Franklin and Martha Washington. Martha was a mean bear by people standards and had to be kept chained to a stake. The other was gentle and was free to roam, hence Gentle Ben.Gentle Ben\u2019s Brewing Company of Tucson\r\n\r\n\r\nBrewing began in 1991 when I bought the business and installed what, at the time, was the only brewery in Tucson. We started with three beers; Tucson Blonde, Red Cat Amber and Copperhead Pale Ale, all still brewed today and joined by five other styles.","website":"http:\/\/gentlebens.com\/","established":"1971","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/w4ubfN\/upload_2Gq3xK-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/w4ubfN\/upload_2Gq3xK-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/w4ubfN\/upload_2Gq3xK-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/w4ubfN\/upload_2Gq3xK-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/w4ubfN\/upload_2Gq3xK-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:27:43","locations":[{"id":"REDaIN","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"865 E.

Whole ingredients are used with traditional brewing equipment which is controlled by state of the art systems that manage temperature throughout the brewing process. These same systems harvest waste BTU's, capturing the energy that would normally be lost and reusing it to preheat ingredients, maintain product temperatures, and even heat the taproom via an in-floor heating system. Waste materials such as process water and spent grain are also captured and stored for fertilization and irrigation of our crops.\r\n\r\nThe prep table in the brewery quite often looks like the prep area in a fine restaurant. Fresh herbs, fruits and vegetables are a common sight, along with an amazing array of spices, roots and even flowers.
