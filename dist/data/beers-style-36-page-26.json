From a funky storefront on the famous Pacific Coast Highway the duo ran the \u201cPizza Port\u201d with a classic menu of pizza and chicken wings to which they added their own \u201cSan Diego\u201d twist.  The Original Pizza Port in Solana Beach\r\n\r\nThe parking was limited and the building crowded with simple hand-built picnic tables and a hodge-podge d\u00e9cor of surf-related paraphernalia almost at odds with the sophisticated flavors of the food. But word spread quickly and it wasn\u2019t long before Pizza Port was a local favorite. \r\n\r\nEarly on Vince took advantage of free space in the restaurant\u2019s storage area to dabble with home brewing. The hobby took off and he was eventually brewing more than could reasonably be consumed at home. So at the urging of friends and fans, the Vince and Gina decided to go into the brewpub business. Pizza Port offered its first craft-brewed beers to patrons in 1992. \r\n\r\nEmbracing the same \u201cflavor-driven\u201d principles that had made the pizza menu so popular, Pizza Port quickly gained a reputation in San Diego\u2019s nascent craft beer scene. In 1997 the company opened a second location a few miles north of Solana Beach in Carlsbad, and a third in 2003 in San Clemente. The same year San Clemente opened (as well as the year after), the original location in Solana Beach won Great American Beer Festival \u201cSmall Brewpub of the Year\u201d. \r\n\r\nThe Pizza Port family\u2019s reputation for great foods and craft beer continued to grow, making them landmarks not just for Southern Californians, but for beer lovers from around the world. In 2008 they opened a premium bottle shop with more that 600 craft beers adjacent to the Carlsbad locations, and by the end of the first decade of the 21st century, the Pizza Ports were a brewing dynasty. In 2009 the Pizza Ports won a staggering 9 medals at the 2009 Great American Beer Festival and Pizza Port Carlsbad was named \u201cLarge Brewpub of the Year\u201d.","website":"http:\/\/www.pizzaport.com\/","established":"1987","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QSVVxD\/upload_g7L5OH-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QSVVxD\/upload_g7L5OH-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QSVVxD\/upload_g7L5OH-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QSVVxD\/upload_g7L5OH-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QSVVxD\/upload_g7L5OH-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:10:31","locations":[{"id":"DrFlD0","name":"Carlsbad","streetAddress":"571 Carlsbad Village Dr.","locality":"Carlsbad","region":"California","postalCode":"92008","phone":"760-720-7007","website":"http:\/\/www.pizzaport.com\/locations\/carlsbad\/","latitude":33.1596505,"longitude":-117.3478111,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1997","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"qAyZMR","name":"Solana Beach","streetAddress":"135 N.

But what began as a light hobby soon developed into a deep passion. They quickly outgrew the offerings of U-Brew and expanded their operation into a homebrew setup. Fifteen years later, the two Mikes have a lot of batches, awards, and experience under their belts. Starting in May of 2008, Vertigo Brewing was christened a fully-licensed brewery in a Hillsboro warehouse. \r\nVertigo Brewing is currently operating a one barrel system, producing eight to ten barrels a month. But as demand takes off, the two Mikes are eagerly looking forward to an expanded business operation. Vertigo prides itself on producing a unique blend of beer offerings that manage to stand out in the beer-saturated market of the Northwest.","website":"http:\/\/www.vertigobrew.com\/","established":"2008","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/K3Jy1E\/upload_P1zfcl-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/K3Jy1E\/upload_P1zfcl-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/K3Jy1E\/upload_P1zfcl-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/K3Jy1E\/upload_P1zfcl-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/K3Jy1E\/upload_P1zfcl-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:10:02","locations":[{"id":"UVhQ24","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"21420 Northwest Nicholas Court","locality":"Hillsboro","region":"Oregon","postalCode":"97124","phone":"503-645-6644","website":"http:\/\/www.vertigobrew.com\/","latitude":45.5316652,"longitude":-122.895556,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2008","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"AtVqhw","name":"True Blonde","nameDisplay":"True Blonde","description":"An exceptionally light colored beer fermented at slightly lower than normal ale temperatures to produce a smooth, crisp, and slightly citrus finish.

The name Gentle Ben\u2019s was chosen through a contest and the winner was a University professor who thought the manager looked like Dan Haggerty from the T.V. show Grizzly Adams whose co-star was a bear named Gentle Ben. That show was based on a man who roamed parts of Northern California in the 1920s and 30s. He had two bears, Benjamin Franklin and Martha Washington. Martha was a mean bear by people standards and had to be kept chained to a stake. The other was gentle and was free to roam, hence Gentle Ben.Gentle Ben\u2019s Brewing Company of Tucson\r\n\r\n\r\nBrewing began in 1991 when I bought the business and installed what, at the time, was the only brewery in Tucson.

With a focus on premium quality, handmade Ales and Lagers, FDBC will present a new unique product to the Detroit area.\r\n\r\nMade in Michigan and the U.S.A.\r\n\r\nOne of the missions of FDBC is to create jobs and spur the economy in Michigan and the U.S. in general. At opening we plan to have 18 positions available with that number doubling year to year. Our long term goal is a bottling factory and additional restaurants that will employee hundreds of local workers.\r\n\r\nKeeping with our philosophy of locally sourced goods and services, we will purchase from local companies whenever possible. On the food side this includes local fish markets, meat markets and bakeries; and on the brewery side designing beers that will be made using Michigan grown hops and malt. And it doesn\u2019t stop there! We are actively negotiating and designing the brew house, promotional materials, general construction and website operations with Michigan companies.\r\n\r\nWhere it is not possible to source a product or service locally or in the State of Michigan, we will be looking first to keep our business in the Mid-West and then United States. We call this an inside-out sourcing philosophy. First source at the city level and slowly work out by county, state, region and country. We feel this benefits everyone in this endeavor where we support the community that is supporting us. A Win-Win for everyone!\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s All About the Beer!\r\n\r\nWe are going to be creating quality; handcrafted beers that we believe will be some of the best beer you have ever tried. We are also going to push the envelope and make beers with unique and far-out ingredients that will invite you to be different and maybe live a little on the edge. We already have over 20 recipes waiting for people to try and enjoy.","website":"http:\/\/www.fallingdownbeer.com","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/vPPBkD\/upload_R6lHp0-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/vPPBkD\/upload_R6lHp0-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/vPPBkD\/upload_R6lHp0-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/vPPBkD\/upload_R6lHp0-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/vPPBkD\/upload_R6lHp0-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:19:03","locations":[{"id":"g3aigX","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2270 East 10 Mile Road","locality":"Warren","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"48091","phone":"586-799-BREW","website":"http:\/\/www.fallingdownbeer.com\/","latitude":42.475464,"longitude":-83.079752,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2014-09-07 17:53:05","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"kSDRTo","name":"Vanilla Bean Blonde","nameDisplay":"Vanilla Bean Blonde","description":"Our crisp Blonde Ale infused with Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla Beans.
