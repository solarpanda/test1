With over 85 breweries in San Diego in January of 2013, we knew that we wanted to add our own unique contribution to the beer scene. Having been raised on both sides of the border, we always enjoyed eating from both cultures.  Mexican Street Tacos, chile enfused candies, enchiladas one day, and Hamburgers, mac and cheese and ding dongs the next. As adults we realized how unique being raised on the border was, how the mix of flavors was seeping from north to south, and south to north. It was this fusion in flavors that inspired to take traditional, European brewing traditions and infuse the process with a whole new palette of Latin American ingredients.  So we dug into our own roots for inspiration and found a treasure trove of brewing traditions, ingredients and unique flavors.  Our best example of this is our Blood Saison, an agave and Hibiscus infused Saison that come off sweet initially, middle tartness and finishing like a beer.","website":"http:\/\/www.borderxbrewing.com\/","established":"2013","mailingListUrl":"info@borderxbrewing.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/dx6426\/upload_OyXAX9-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/dx6426\/upload_OyXAX9-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/dx6426\/upload_OyXAX9-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/dx6426\/upload_OyXAX9-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/dx6426\/upload_OyXAX9-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-16 00:07:12","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:04:57","locations":[{"id":"IDHs4u","name":"Logan Tasting Room","streetAddress":"2181 Logan Ave","locality":"San Diego","region":"California","postalCode":"92113","phone":"6194310771","website":"http:\/\/www.borderxbrewing.com","hoursOfOperation":"Wed:  2:00pm - 8:00pm\r\nThu:  2:00pm - 8:00pm\r\nFri:  2:00pm - 11:00pm\r\nSat:  2:00pm - 11:00pm\r\nSun:  2:00pm - 6:00pm","latitude":32.6981297,"longitude":-117.1397481,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"restaurant","locationTypeDisplay":"Restaurant\/Ale House","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-16 00:07:12","updateDate":"2015-11-18 21:16:23","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"cRLX8x","name":"Otay Brewery","streetAddress":"8684 Avenida De La Fuente Ste 8","locality":"San Diego","region":"California","postalCode":"92154","phone":"6194310771","website":"http:\/\/www.borderxbrewing.com\/","latitude":32.5566393,"longitude":-116.9567988,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-18 16:21:01","updateDate":"2015-06-15 19:18:10","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"W1dd52","name":"Amigo Warmer","nameDisplay":"Amigo Warmer","description":"Inspired by Theo\u2019s Chili chocolate bar, this stout was dosed with chocolate, cinnamon, and Guajillo chili after fermentation.

We started out modestly as Home Brew Mart in 1992. Our goal was to teach others how to brew quality handcrafted beer at home. In 1996 the brewery was installed by New World Brewing Systems in the space behind our retail store and production began in September. In May of 2005 we open our second brewery in Scripps Ranch.  We currently distribute five of our favorite beers, Yellowtail Pale Ale,  Calico Amber Ale , Big Eye I.P.A., Black Marlin Porter and Wahoo Wheat Beer to a thirsty San Diego.  Come to our brewery and we will gladly give you a tour and allow you to sample our newest selection of beers. Currently our beer is available in twelve ounce bottles to 15.5 gallon kegs. We also offer half gallon and gallon glass jugs to go. Kegs are available for rent to the public with a minimum deposit.  The name for our brewery comes from the point where Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo first set foot in California. Located on the Point Loma Peninsula, Ballast Point is considered the gateway to San Diego Harbor. Stones from this area were used as ballast in the cargo holds of sailing ships returning to the eastern seaboard. Many New England streets are still lined with the cobblestones brought back from San Diego.","website":"http:\/\/www.ballastpoint.com\/","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:45","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:39:04","locations":[{"id":"PckBjw","name":"Home Brew Mart","streetAddress":"5401 Linda Vista Road","extendedAddress":"#406","locality":"San Diego","region":"California","postalCode":"92110","phone":"(619) 295-2337","website":"http:\/\/www.ballastpoint.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Tasting Room & Store Hours\r\nMonday-Friday, 11:00-7:00\r\nSaturday-Sunday, 10:00-5:00","latitude":32.7667586,"longitude":-117.1952129,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:45","updateDate":"2014-09-29 20:33:49","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"a7VHpi","name":"Scripps Ranch Brewery","streetAddress":"10051 Old Grove Rd","locality":"San Diego","region":"California","postalCode":"92131","phone":"(858) 695-2739","website":"http:\/\/www.ballastpoint.com\/","latitude":32.898466,"longitude":-117.110794,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-12-07 00:05:42","updateDate":"2015-06-11 14:39:57","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"cLcfTf","name":"Tasting Room & Kitchen","streetAddress":"2215 India St","locality":"San Diego","region":"California","postalCode":"92101","phone":"(619) 255-7213","website":"http:\/\/www.ballastpoint.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  11:00am - 11:00pm\nTue:  11:00am - 11:00pm\nWed:  11:00am - 11:00pm\nThu:  11:00am - 11:00pm\nFri:  11:00am - 11:00pm\nSat:  11:00am - 11:00pm\nSun:  11:00am - 9:00pm\n\n","latitude":32.7277143,"longitude":-117.1697202,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-21 12:03:59","updateDate":"2015-06-11 13:48:56","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"1zYgG4","name":"Miramar","streetAddress":"9045 Carroll Way","locality":"San Diego","region":"California","postalCode":"92121","phone":"8587906900","website":"www.ballastpoint.com","latitude":32.8881618,"longitude":-117.1580141,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2014","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-06-09 16:08:18","updateDate":"2015-06-16 14:59:03","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"gRg0OA","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"9045 Carroll Way","locality":"San Diego","region":"California","postalCode":"92121","phone":"8587906900","website":"www.ballastpoint.com","hoursOfOperation":"Mon\u2013Sat 11:00am\u201311:00pm\r\nSunday 11:00am\u20139:00pm","latitude":32.8881618,"longitude":-117.1580141,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2015-06-09 20:31:45","updateDate":"2015-06-16 14:59:48","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"kr3KqQ","name":"Ballast Point Long Beach","streetAddress":"110 N.
