Let me explain. 350 Augusta Ave. was our address in Dekalb, IL. At the time, your founders Todd and Erik spent more time on projects like way below average punk rock bands in the attic, and a Hardcore Wrestling Federation called WCVF (this took place in our kitchen), instead of focusing on classes like Humanities 227 in DuSable Hall. I mean, have you ever choke slammed one of your best friends into an oven pre-heated to \"550 degrees\"? Well i have, and that was just a random Wednesday night. This raw energy (stupidity) and creativity is what eventually drew us to the Craft Beer scene. That\u2019s what craft beer is\u2026a creative and fresh twist on a beverage that has been mass produced and shoved down our throats for much too long (carefully stepping down from soapbox). Why not name our Brewery after the point in our life when we were most creative? Well\u2026..we did. It was during these times we were also introduced to good, quality beer.\r\n\r\nOnce NIU had enough of our shenanigans, Erik went on to continue his education while I submerged myself into the cesspool known as corporate America. I feel dirty just talking about it. Over the last decade, my soul has been slowly rotting and exiting my body so there was a need for this creative juice to be squeezed once again. Since wrestling and punk rock was now out of the question, brewing beer quickly became that much needed release from the Groundhog Day that had become the norm for us. Erik like most homebrewers started out brewing with extract several years ago and quickly rose to the challenge of all-grain batches. Erik, the 350 Head brewer, has been very successful when entering brewing competitions walking away with multiple awards for his Porter and Patersbier. Myself on the other hand have had a love for flavorful craft beer for many moons, and once I learned of Erik\u2019s brewing expertise years ago, I too became emerged in this brewing lifestyle. It was a match made in heaven. Erik brewed awesome beer, and I was awesome at drinking and sharing that beer!!! \r\n\r\nFrom that point on things just sort of clicked and for the last 2 years Erik and I have been researching and concocting this master plan of opening a brewery. The time has come. We want all of you to enjoy this journey with us. Tinley Park has always been our #1 choice for the 350 Brewing Company. Downtown Tinley Park embodies the spirit of 350. With great electricity in the downtown area, coupled with an amazing artistic feel, will definitely pair well with our vision of always making sure a visit to our brewery is an interesting experience. We feel Tinley Park is ready for a neighborhood brewery. It really was an easy decision based on Tinley Park\u2019s sense of community and passion for supporting local products.\r\n\r\nWe are looking forward to joining the family of incredible Illinois Brewers. We should all thank our lucky stars that we live in a state with such high quality Breweries.","website":"http:\/\/350Brewing.com","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/W3pb09\/upload_uohtEs-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/W3pb09\/upload_uohtEs-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/W3pb09\/upload_uohtEs-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/W3pb09\/upload_uohtEs-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/W3pb09\/upload_uohtEs-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-07-25 13:35:25","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:56:23","locations":[{"id":"1mRL8J","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"7144 183rd St","locality":"Tinley Park","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60477","website":"http:\/\/350Brewing.com","latitude":41.5593734,"longitude":-87.7911748,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-07-25 13:36:01","updateDate":"2015-12-03 19:00:50","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"RAaG78","name":"Hackett Irish Stout","nameDisplay":"Hackett Irish Stout","description":"Named after long time friend and Irishman, the Hackett name represents hard work, good humor, hard drinking, and honest livin'.

The Micro Brewing Company and Restaurant is known as a neighborhood icon in Fresno. Scott and Michele changed the name to wholesale their beer throughout the United States.\r\n\r\nKevin continued on as Sequoia's Brewmaster, putting together a creative mix of 11 unique ales and lagers on tap brewed with the finest ingredients including monthly special beers, wines, specialty drinks, and their homemade Root Beer. Recently, Rick Bouke took over as Brewmaster, and is responsible for the high quality and craft beer character our customers have come to expect. Sequoia's menu offers great food with the freshest ingredients, serves Certified Angus Beef, prepares their sauces and items from scratch and offers fresh daily fish.\r\n\r\nSequoia offers a menu for all ages in a warm and comfortable atmosphere, where everyone knows your name.

We had fun and we still have Silver City Guests ask us about 39 cent hamburgers and grilled onion burgers. We miss 'em too, but we proved it's real hard to put the big hamburger chains out of business. It isn't as easy as it looks.\r\n\r\nIn 1996 we decided to switch gears and get into the Brewpub business. We sold our Bremerton location and remodeled the Silverdale location into what it is today.\r\n\r\nWe operate today on the same principles as we did when we opened our first Top Notch Burger. We work hard at making sure each Guest leaves happier than when they arrived. We work hard side-by-side with our staff and train them to treat their Guests like you would treat a Guest in your own home.","website":"http:\/\/www.silvercitybrewery.com\/","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/tIgHYj\/upload_A4646V-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/tIgHYj\/upload_A4646V-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/tIgHYj\/upload_A4646V-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/tIgHYj\/upload_A4646V-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/tIgHYj\/upload_A4646V-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:04:47","locations":[{"id":"XDsUGb","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2799 NW Myhre Road","locality":"Silverdale","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98383","phone":"360-698-5879","website":"http:\/\/www.silvercitybrewery.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Thurs: 11:00 am - 10:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:00 am - 11:00 pm\r\nSun: 11:00 am - 9:00 pm","latitude":47.659282,"longitude":-122.687358,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"q3oLR1","name":"Irish Style Dry Stout","nameDisplay":"Irish Style Dry Stout","description":"The type of Stout commonly found in Ireland.

We were busy creating the same kind of crisp, refreshing beer we're known for today. While hundreds of such family-owned breweries have come and gone in the years since, we believe the reasons for our success are simple. We've never compromised on quality in producing our award-winning brews and we've never lost sight of our rich Rocky Mountain heritage.

We hope to engender the spirit of camaraderie and hard work that we imagine those living and brewing in this neighborhood at that time embodied.\r\n\r\nWe self distribute our beer, which means each beer that you drink in a bar or restaurant is poured from a keg that we delivered cold in our refrigerated van (keep your eyes peeled for it around town). We like to keep beer as fresh as possible, which means that every keg we fill is immediately moved into cold storage where it sits until we load it onto our refrigerated van for delivery to the coldbox of each local account.

Some slight acidity may be perceived but is not necessary. European hop aroma and flavor should be low or not perceived. Dry stouts have medium-light to medium body. Fruity esters are minimal and overshadowed by malt, high hop bitterness, and roasted barley character. Diacetyl (butterscotch) should be very low or not perceived.
