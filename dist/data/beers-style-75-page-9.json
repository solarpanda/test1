According to German criteria for a true pilsener, however, the vast majority of them would be unrecognizable as such. By this definition, a pilsener is a lager beer with a light golden color (5-8 color units by European Brewers' Convention standards), a specific gravity in the 11.5-12.5% Plato range, and a hops content of at least 28 EBUs (European Bitter Units). Most so-called domestic \"pilseners\" fall far short in these categories; Bayern Pilsener easily meets all three (6 color units, 12% Plato, 34 EBUs).\r\n\r\n What does all this technical jargon mean? It means you have purchased one of the very few authenic pilseners brewed in America. Reward yourself by enjoying this beer the way it was meant to be served: pour your cold Bayern Pilsener, in two or three slow steps, into the center of your glass (a fluted or \"tulip\" glass works best). The thick creamy head (the German term for this is \"crown\") and you have just created the mark of a classic Bavarian pilsener. It is functional, too - the crown holds finely distributed natural carbonation inside the glass and acts as a shelter for this beer's distintive, hoppy flavor.","abv":"5","ibu":"32","srmId":6,"availableId":1,"styleId":75,"isOrganic":"Y","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/cXG4y4\/upload_P19kfu-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/cXG4y4\/upload_P19kfu-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/cXG4y4\/upload_P19kfu-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","originalGravity":"1.048","createDate":"2015-05-20 18:48:07","updateDate":"2015-12-18 01:16:03","srm":{"id":6,"name":"6","hex":"F8A600"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":75,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"German-Style Pilsener","shortName":"German Pilsener","description":"A classic German Pilsener is very light straw or golden in color and well hopped.

In 2003 Skip and Phin purchased the defunct Old Saddle Back Brewing Co. in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. All the equipment was removed and brought back to Lakewood, New York and set up at its new 10,000 square foot home, The Southern Tier Brewing Company. The Brewery began operations in February 2004 distributing regionally. By 2005 sales covered the majority of the New York State and the eastern half of Pennsylvania. In the beginning their two Flagship brands were a Pilsner and Mild Ale. Oh yeah they also brewed IPA! As it turned out the flagships were a flop and the IPA was a huge success. They next launched a line of seasonal beers which have gained great success. Since the beginning, Southern Tier has experienced steady growth, currently distributing to over 25% of the United States. Multiple expansions have been made to keep up with demand and the brewery continues to be innovative by producing new products.

Through the years the company has grown from a three person operation to a staff of almost 50, from about 4,000 to 35,000 square feet, and from a capacity to brew 2,000 barrels annually to almost 40,000. Those of you who saw the old brewery may remember the retrofitted dairy equipment we used. We held on to two of those tanks in our move to the East Asheville location. Alongside them, we have new fermentation and brite beer tanks to go with our 50-barrel brew house. Our pilot brew house is a brewer's playground for developing new seasonal beers, high gravity brews, and whatever else the brewers dream up. Highland currently supplies both Carolinas, Georgia, Tennessee, Florida, Alabama, Ohio, Kentucky and Virginia.

It has a fantastic malty aroma with a slight spice from the hops. The head is brilliant white and floats on the clean pale lager. The sparkling mouthfeel gives way to a soft malt sweetness that is followed by a long, dry, crisp finish. The balanced clean finish taunts the mouth to take another drink. Lagered for a minimum of 8-12 weeks to ensure smoothness and drinkability.\r\n\r\nAll ingredients for the beer are imported from Germany.

A brewery has been in the works for sometime. Lots of discussions on what if we had a brewery were had, over lots of good German beer. The opportunity came for us to travel to Germany to really get involved with the German brewing process and ideology - as well as sample the best beer on earth. After that trip, the direction of the brewery was set. German beer had to be re-discovered by the population. After many discussions on opening a brewery and a trip to Germany, the dream became reality. We found an existing brewery to purchase - Lunar Brewing. After purchasing Lunar and getting approved for all the necessary licensing, Baron is ready to go. On June 14th, the world of Seattle will have the chance to finally taste and purchase Baron Beer. The first style of many to be released is our flagship beer - Munich Lager.That is all for the history. We are growing on a daily basis and plan to be around for quite some time.","website":"http:\/\/www.baronbeer.com\/","established":"2003","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/g5GKTi\/upload_3DZ2nS-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/g5GKTi\/upload_3DZ2nS-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/g5GKTi\/upload_3DZ2nS-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/g5GKTi\/upload_3DZ2nS-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/g5GKTi\/upload_3DZ2nS-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:45","updateDate":"2016-01-27 18:03:08","locations":[{"id":"TtXDhG","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1605 S 93rd Building E","extendedAddress":"Unit L","locality":"Seattle","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98108","phone":"206.764.1213","website":"http:\/\/www.baronbeer.com\/","latitude":47.520289,"longitude":-122.3124918,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2003","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:45","updateDate":"2016-01-27 18:03:18","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
