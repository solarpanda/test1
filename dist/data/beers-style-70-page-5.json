We brew in small batches and use several strains of yeast to produce our beers.   The drinker may notice slight nuances from batch to batch.  But, you will find that all our ales are aged and, just like a fine wine, can be laid down for extended periods.   This results in a unique drinking experience each time a bottle is opened.\r\n\r\nHere at Draai Laag we like to cater to those that want something respectful of tradition, but ultimately different.  Those who are not satisfied drinking the norm.  Most importantly, we get our biggest enjoyment and fulfillment not from profit, but from your smile after the first sip.\r\n\r\nThis company was built on the dream of doing what we love and following our passion.

Rogue's first brewpub was located in Ashland, Oregon and was a 10bbl brewsystem. Rogue opened a second brewpub, 15bbl brewsystem, in May 1989 located in Newport, Oregon. Rogue closed its Ashland operation in 1997, after the great flood destroyed the place. In 1991, the 15bbl system, named Howard after John Maier's former boss, from the Newport brewpub was transferred across the bay to the current brewery and upgraded to a 30bbl system. In 1998 Rogue bought a 50bbl brewsystem, named Kobe. Kobe is the only brewsystem in use. Tours: We offer brewery tours every day at 3 pm (followed by a distillery tour at 4pm). Go up to the bar inside the brewery (Brewers on the Bay) and check in with the bartender and the tour will commence. Please call ahead if you have a large group and or to verify the tour time...Brewer's on the Bay phone is 541-867-3664.

Last year we decided to play around with the concept and see where it might take us. After much tinkering -with a number of unique ingredients combined with wood barrel aging- we arrived at this wonderful juxtaposition of fruitiness and maltiness which harmonized magically to produce this delicious winter warmer.\r\n\r\nThe designation of \"Grand Cru\" originates from the Burgundy region of France. Brewers have taken the term and applied to it more elaborate, aged and reserved versions of their beers. Our Belgian-style Dubbel -a great beer itself with a loyal following- has been taken to the next level by the careful blending and aging techniques. We believe we\u2019ve created a classic to be enjoyed throughout the winter months.\r\n\r\nFor 2010, we offer a very limited release of (only 48 barrels) our Winter Grand Cru. In this batch, we\u2019ve added over 100 pounds each of locally sourced Zante Currants and Black Mission Figs. We aged 20% in used Bourbon barrels for 12 months - in which time the warmth of the Bourbon, along with toasted oak and vanilla flavors were released from the wood. Whole Vanilla beans compliment the wood and bring forth a velvety smoothness and richness. The fig flavor is forward on the nose along with the bubble-gum\/banana ester derived during fermentation. The taste starts with the rich sweetness of fruit, carries through with a rich mellow center and finishes dry, allowing for another glass as you sit by the cozy fire. \u00c1 votre sant\u00e9!","abv":"8.5","ibu":"20","glasswareId":5,"srmId":29,"availableId":4,"styleId":70,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:18","updateDate":"2015-01-05 14:44:21","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"srm":{"id":29,"name":"29","hex":"660D00"},"available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":70,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Other Belgian-Style Ales","shortName":"Belgian Ale","description":"Recognizing the uniqueness and traditions of several other styles of Belgian Ales, the beers entered in this category will be assessed on the merits that they do not fit existing style guidelines and information that the brewer provides explaining the history and tradition of the style.

That early Web site helped generate positive press coverage and helped attract the investors needed to make the virtual brewery a real one. Muller said the idea was to make the Web site \u201cThis Old House meets the World Wide Web\u201d\u2014letting people go behind the taps and see the thousands of details needed to put a microbrewery together.\r\n\r\nHe also wanted to give beer lovers a chance, via their computers, to roll up their cyber-sleeves and help build the brewery. The site let beer lovers help select and name beers, design t-shirts and labels, volunteer to be a taste-tester and even apply for a job as a brewer. Visitors to the Web site can sign up for FlyingFishMail a monthly e-mail newsletter which now boasts more than 12,000 subscribers.\r\n\r\nMuller, who got into the brewing field to become a brewer, trained at Chicago's Siebel Institute of Technology, America's oldest brewing school. He quickly realized someone was going to have to run the day-to-day business of the brewery and now serves as President and Head Janitor (though not necessarily in that order).\r\n\r\nFlying Fish Brewing Company is located in Somerdale, New Jersey, approximately seven miles east of Philadelphia. In a state that once boasted 50 breweries, it is the first microbrewery in Southern New Jersey and the first new brewery built in that part of the state in more than half a century.

Butchers, bakers, farmers and even brewers, made their products for local consumption.\r\n\r\nFounded in 2009, Draai Laag began as a way to introduce beer with creative flavors into the market, offering a bit of variety in a world of Pilsners, Pales Ales and Porters.\r\n\r\nHere at Draai Laag we use old world methods, such as bottle conditioning by aging our ales on lees.  We brew in small batches and use several strains of yeast to produce our beers.   The drinker may notice slight nuances from batch to batch.  But, you will find that all our ales are aged and, just like a fine wine, can be laid down for extended periods.   This results in a unique drinking experience each time a bottle is opened.\r\n\r\nHere at Draai Laag we like to cater to those that want something respectful of tradition, but ultimately different.  Those who are not satisfied drinking the norm.  Most importantly, we get our biggest enjoyment and fulfillment not from profit, but from your smile after the first sip.\r\n\r\nThis company was built on the dream of doing what we love and following our passion.  For those who understand us, we thank you and hope you enjoy what we have to contribute.","website":"http:\/\/www.draailaag.com","established":"2009","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/vdiLuR\/upload_Z7Vqqh-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/vdiLuR\/upload_Z7Vqqh-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/vdiLuR\/upload_Z7Vqqh-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/vdiLuR\/upload_Z7Vqqh-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/vdiLuR\/upload_Z7Vqqh-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-02-27 13:08:37","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:51:41","locations":[{"id":"DXRyuX","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"501 East Ohio Street","locality":"Millvale","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"15209","website":"http:\/\/www.draailaag.com\/","latitude":40.4787751,"longitude":-79.968181,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-02-27 13:09:32","updateDate":"2014-12-04 15:59:36","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"ObHayQ","name":"Head Trip","nameDisplay":"Head Trip","description":"Sweet with some\ntropical flavors, some banana, a hint of clove.","abv":"10.5","styleId":70,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:21","updateDate":"2012-03-22 13:05:06","style":{"id":70,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Other Belgian-Style Ales","shortName":"Belgian Ale","description":"Recognizing the uniqueness and traditions of several other styles of Belgian Ales, the beers entered in this category will be assessed on the merits that they do not fit existing style guidelines and information that the brewer provides explaining the history and tradition of the style.
