The North Davidson (NoDa) neighborhood is known as the creative center of Charlotte: as a natural extension of NoDa\u2019s artistic spirit, there isn\u2019t a better place for a microbrewery to call home.\r\n\r\nNoDa Brewing is a 15 barrel brewery creating the highest quality beers for local restaurants and pubs, as well as our tap room.  Our beer styles will have a Northwestern feel, showcasing American Pale Ales, India Pale Ales, and Porters.  Our small size gives us the flexibility to introduce many unique and artistic recipes as well as our renditions of classic varieties such as Imperial Stouts, Wit beers, and Winter Warmers.  Our Head Brewer frequently traveled to Europe over the past couple years.  He has been fortunate to have experienced the wonderful beers that have historically defined many current craft beer styles.  As we pay homage to these great and historic beers, we\u2019ll add an American Flair that will be embraced in the Carolinas and beyond.","website":"http:\/\/www.nodabrewing.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/pcrctk\/upload_YHM8QJ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/pcrctk\/upload_YHM8QJ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/pcrctk\/upload_YHM8QJ-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/pcrctk\/upload_YHM8QJ-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/pcrctk\/upload_YHM8QJ-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:03","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:20:43","locations":[{"id":"oGBBGF","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2229 North Davidson St","locality":"Charlotte","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"28205","phone":"(704) 900-6851","website":"http:\/\/www.nodabrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday - 4 - 8:30\r\nTuesday - 4-8:30\r\nWednesday - 4-9\r\nThursday- 4-8:30\r\nFriday - 4-9:30\r\nSaturday - 12-10\r\nSunday - 1-6","latitude":35.240347,"longitude":-80.814842,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:03","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"u99e3l","name":"Barrel Aged Grizz","nameDisplay":"Barrel Aged Grizz","description":"Barrel aged in French oak for 14 months, this epic Belgian-inspired Brown Ale is wild and untamed.
