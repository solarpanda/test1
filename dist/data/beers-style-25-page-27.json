In 1978 they began taking formal tasting notes on each new beer they could find.\r\n\r\nBy the early 1990s the Tuppers had tasted and evaluated over 6,000 beers and visited hundreds of breweries.  They had found many excellent beers, but envisioned an ale that no one had made\u2014one that would encompass bold American flavors and traditional European brewing techniques.  They asked Old Dominion Brewing Co., which they felt was one of the very best craft breweries in the country, to work with them to develop this ideal ale.  Tuppers\u2019 Hop Pocket Ale was the result.  \r\n\r\nIn 1997 the Tuppers again worked with the Old Dominion brewers to create Tuppers\u2019 Hop Pocket Pils, based on the Keller or Hefe Pils style of Northern Bavaria, but with a unique American boldness to the flavor.\r\n\r\nThe Tuppers live in Bethesda, Maryland, where Bob teaches history.  Ellie works in Washington as a production editor of scientific books.  The Tuppers still travel and taste beers and now have notes on over 14,000 different brews.","website":"http:\/\/tuppersbeers.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/7JTum5\/upload_ROqFMo-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/7JTum5\/upload_ROqFMo-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/7JTum5\/upload_ROqFMo-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/7JTum5\/upload_ROqFMo-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/7JTum5\/upload_ROqFMo-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:01:15","locations":[{"id":"SsYPgS","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"6404 Redwing Road","locality":"Bethesda","region":"Maryland","postalCode":"20817","phone":"301-229-2027","website":"http:\/\/tuppersbeers.com\/","latitude":38.973459,"longitude":-77.127249,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"4rzemi","name":"Hop Pursuit","nameDisplay":"Hop Pursuit","description":"When the sun begins to rise earlier and stays out longer, we will celebrate the coming of spring and the sprouting of the new hop crop with Hop Pursuit. A crisp, orange blonde extra pale ale with a medium malt body that\u2019s chased by a ton of hop flavor and zing of bitterness. We brewed it with the less aggressive, old school craft brewing hops\u2013 Cascade, Willamette, and Mt. Hood\u2013 to celebrate more of the hop flavor and less of the hop bitterness. These give the beer a nice and fresh citrus herbal character without a lot of intensity; instead it has a softly flavorful character with touches of orange and lemon.  We dry hopped for two weeks to amplify these delicate hop flavors. Gold medal winner at the 2010 World Beer Championships!

Chris Hunt and Duncan Guy began their brewing education in the Barley Mob Brewers homebrewing club and continued to search for unique and distinctive ale and lager formulas. They decided to offer their creations to the public through a small batch microbrewery in 2006.  Soon thereafter, award-winning brewer Courtney Tyvand joined the two and presented his smoked porter at the brewery\u2019s first beer dinner in October of 2006.\r\n\r\nThe brewery is located on the ground floor of a historic building at 4015 Tennessee Avenue in St. Elmo.  The building is constructed of foot-square cedar timbers and two-foot thick walls made of granite stone and mortar.  Built in 1911 as a packaging factory for K-Rations for WWI, we occasionally find artifacts from that era in the building walls and ceiling.  The brewery shares space with the Chattanooga U-Brew, a brew-on-premises business owned by Greg McCort. \r\n\r\nMBBC is proud to offer small batch specialty ales and lagers in kegs of various sizes.  A tasting room is part of the brewery; samples of our beers can be tasted and tested on premises.

With a 15 barrel system and a restaurant that compliments the fine hand crafted beer, Hop Valley has grown into one of Springfield's largest businesses.  Distributing beer throughout the Western States.\r\nBased on that success, and significant pent up demand for their beer, Hop Valley opened a new facility at 990 W.1st Ave in Eugene at which they have built a new, much larger, 60 barrel production brewery.  This facility will be capable of producing up to 100,000 barrels per year, in stark contrast to the system in Springfield, that is maxed out at about 4000 barrels produced in 2012.\r\nOur state of the art equipment and the facility are all built with every opportunity toward a green foot print, including the most efficient lighting, boiler, solar heating, etc.. available today.\r\nThe new facility has a large tasting room and outdoor patio and also has limited food service, to allow customers to enjoy all of our craft brews in a very comfortable setting, and with enough parking and outdoor area to support large parties!","website":"http:\/\/www.hopvalleybrewing.com\/","established":"2009","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/8IJKF0\/upload_DhZACn-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/8IJKF0\/upload_DhZACn-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/8IJKF0\/upload_DhZACn-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/8IJKF0\/upload_DhZACn-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/8IJKF0\/upload_DhZACn-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:15:36","locations":[{"id":"dqfA53","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"980 Kruse Way","locality":"Springfield","region":"Oregon","postalCode":"97477","phone":"(541) 744-3330","website":"http:\/\/www.hopvalleybrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Thu: 11:00 am - 11:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:00 am - 1:00 am\r\nSun: 11:00 am - 11:00 pm","latitude":44.082956,"longitude":-123.039863,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2009","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"OTt7Vx","name":"Hop Valley Brewing Co.","streetAddress":"990 W.1st Ave","locality":"Eugene","region":"Oregon","postalCode":"97402","phone":"541-485-2337","website":"http:\/\/www.hopvalleybrewing.com","hoursOfOperation":"11:30am-10:00pm Sunday-Wednesday\r\n11:30am-11:00pm Thursday-Saturday","latitude":44.05819,"longitude":-123.107531,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-13 00:51:08","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"ExhtfR","name":"Hop' Nautic Pale Ale","nameDisplay":"Hop' Nautic Pale Ale","abv":"5.3","glasswareId":5,"availableId":3,"styleId":25,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/ExhtfR\/upload_j9Wwvq-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/ExhtfR\/upload_j9Wwvq-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/ExhtfR\/upload_j9Wwvq-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:25","updateDate":"2015-12-16 14:03:10","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":3,"name":"Not Available","description":"Beer is not available."},"style":{"id":25,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"American Pale","description":"American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.

Our ingredient list: water, malt, hops, and yeast. This is what we mean when we say our beer is FERMENTED IN SANITY. You know who makes it, you know what it\u2019s made with. You know after having one you\u2019ll want another.\r\n\r\nWe brew traditional, bold beers for those who demand quality and consistency.
