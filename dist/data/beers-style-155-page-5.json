Rich, full-bodied and intriguing, Newfoundland Screech barrels were the inspiration for this semi-dry cider, which opens up to reveal complex notes of molasses, apples and rum. Raise a glass of Sea Cider and let your apples out of the barrel!\r\n\r\nThe Story:\r\nRumrunner cider is our homage to the people who, during Prohibition, ran illicit boats full of liquor across the international line in the coastal waters that can be seen from our Ciderhouse. This seafaring connection was first formed when we obtained Newfoundland \u201cScreech\u201d barrels to age one of our cider blends. Rum and bourbon barrels were once a cidermaker\u2019s only storage option and their use imparted distinctly spirited notes to traditional cider. Our Rumrunner cider blends the juice of highly aromatic apples, such as Stayman\u2019s Winesaps and Winter Bananas (all certified organic), so that the apple aromas match the intensity of the oak and rum notes.\r\n\r\nTasting Notes:\r\nAppearance: Rich mahogany, gently effervescent.\r\nAromas, flavours: Molasses, apple butter, rum.\r\nAcid\/sweetness: Semi-dry, good acid balance.\r\nMouthfeel: Smooth, long finish.","abv":"12.5","styleId":155,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/hXrJwK\/upload_O2uVjw-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/hXrJwK\/upload_O2uVjw-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/hXrJwK\/upload_O2uVjw-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"Pears, walnuts, duck, pork, blue cheeses, aged cheddar, salty cured meats, braised meat dishes.","createDate":"2015-02-16 17:24:32","updateDate":"2015-12-17 20:43:04","style":{"id":155,"categoryId":12,"category":{"id":12,"name":"Mead, Cider, & Perry","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Fruit Cider","shortName":"Fruit Cider","description":"Like a dry wine with complex flavors.

The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery. Goose Island beers are now enjoyed in all 50 states and Europe.","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:46:51","locations":[{"id":"S2n5TB","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1800 West Fulton Street","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60612","phone":"1-800-466-7363","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","latitude":41.887107,"longitude":-87.6720969,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:33:51","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"D2gG2C","name":"Clybourn","streetAddress":"1800 North Clybourn Avenue","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60614","phone":"800-466-7363","latitude":41.9137242,"longitude":-87.65373,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1988","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:32:55","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"BdK3is","name":"Sidra Brut Nature","nameDisplay":"Sidra Brut Nature","description":"Sidra Guzm\u00e1n Riestra Brut Nature, made from our cider base obtained by a careful selection of the best cider apples using the traditional method of second fermentation in the bottle.

This is a sparkling cider produced through the methode champenoise, with a second fermentation and aging in the bottle that has been received by critics and the public with great appreciation.","website":"http:\/\/www.sidrariestra.com\/en\/index.php","established":"1906","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/lg6clw\/upload_BMzDxZ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/lg6clw\/upload_BMzDxZ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/lg6clw\/upload_BMzDxZ-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/lg6clw\/upload_BMzDxZ-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/lg6clw\/upload_BMzDxZ-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-18 14:17:45","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:05:04","locations":[{"id":"TOVxbG","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"33518","locality":"Asturias","phone":"+34 985 74 82 98","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  9:00am - 7:00pm\nTue:  9:00am - 7:00pm\nWed:  9:00am - 7:00pm\nThu:  9:00am - 7:00pm\nFri:  9:00am - 7:00pm\n\n","latitude":43.4155777,"longitude":-5.5722297,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"ES","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-18 21:24:03","updateDate":"2015-02-18 21:26:03","country":{"isoCode":"ES","name":"SPAIN","displayName":"Spain","isoThree":"ESP","numberCode":724,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"2bQlzz","name":"Small Batch No. 2","nameDisplay":"Small Batch No. 2","styleId":155,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-08-04 20:15:59","updateDate":"2015-08-04 20:15:59","style":{"id":155,"categoryId":12,"category":{"id":12,"name":"Mead, Cider, & Perry","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Fruit Cider","shortName":"Fruit Cider","description":"Like a dry wine with complex flavors.

Word spread and soon local pubs began to buy Brothers.\r\n\r\nIt is now sold in bars all over the country and loads of other music festivals in the summer.","website":"http:\/\/www.brotherscider.co.uk\/","established":"1658","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/h9KorD\/upload_i8led3-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/h9KorD\/upload_i8led3-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/h9KorD\/upload_i8led3-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/h9KorD\/upload_i8led3-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/h9KorD\/upload_i8led3-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-17 23:15:32","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:43:23","locations":[{"id":"9Pj2Cr","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Anglo Trading Estate","locality":"Shepton Mallet","region":"Somerset","postalCode":"BA4 5BY","phone":"+44 1749 333456","website":"http:\/\/www.brotherscider.co.uk\/","latitude":51.1918626,"longitude":-2.5507815,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"GB","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-22 11:53:07","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"GB","name":"UNITED KINGDOM","displayName":"United Kingdom","isoThree":"GBR","numberCode":826,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Hw3Q1C","name":"Strawberry Hard Cider","nameDisplay":"Strawberry Hard Cider","description":"Traditional hard apple cider blended with 100 percent strawberry juice pressed from local strawberries.","abv":"6","styleId":155,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-08-02 14:43:51","updateDate":"2015-08-02 14:43:51","style":{"id":155,"categoryId":12,"category":{"id":12,"name":"Mead, Cider, & Perry","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Fruit Cider","shortName":"Fruit Cider","description":"Like a dry wine with complex flavors.
