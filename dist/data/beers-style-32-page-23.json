By the end of the 19th-Century the brewery would be one of the largest in the United States. The brewery closed its doors when Prohibition began in 1919. The brand was revived in 1981 as one of the pioneer craft beers of todays craft beer movement, with the introduction of a series of Christian Moerlein beers by the Hudepohl Brewing Company. In 1984, Christian Moerlein Lager was the first American beer ever certified by the German government to pass the German Beer Purity Law (Reinheitsgebot). After a series of sales that took the business and brewing out of the region, the company was relocated once again to Cincinnati in 2004 by Gregory Hardman, its current local owner. With the goal of returning Cincinnati's grand brewing traditions, Hardman led the effort to build a world-class Moerlein Lager House brewery\/gastropub on the banks of the Ohio River which opened in 2012 in Cincinnati's Smale Riverfront Park next to Great American Ballpark, home of the Cincinnati Reds. A spectacular craft brewing facility and Malt House Taproom opened in 2013 in the historic Over-the-Rhine brewery district, just blocks from its original 19th century home. The brewery offers tours and has a taproom in an original 1860's malt house complete with historic underground lagering cellars. The brewery is the first American craft brewer to rescue a City's heritage beer brands and owns Hudepohl-Schoenling Brewing Co. including the brands of Hudepohl, Hudy Delight, Hudy 14-K, Burger and Little Kings Cream Ale brands.","website":"http:\/\/www.christianmoerlein.com\/","established":"1853","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Em1uno\/upload_DkG1sa-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Em1uno\/upload_DkG1sa-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Em1uno\/upload_DkG1sa-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Em1uno\/upload_DkG1sa-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Em1uno\/upload_DkG1sa-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:50","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:11:17","locations":[{"id":"qo6LCf","name":"Main Brewery, General Offices and Taproom","streetAddress":"1621 Moore St.","locality":"Cincinnati","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45202","phone":"513-827-6025","website":"http:\/\/www.christianmoerlein.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Wed:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\nThu:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\nFri:  4:00pm - 12:00am\nSat:  12:00pm - 12:00am\nSun:  12:00pm - 7:00pm\n\n","latitude":39.1137948,"longitude":-84.5150108,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1853","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:50","updateDate":"2014-12-15 02:45:48","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"X0HMO8","name":"Christian Moerlein Lager House","streetAddress":"115 Joe Nuxhall Way","locality":"Cincinnati","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45202","phone":"513-421-2337","website":"http:\/\/www.moerleinlagerhouse.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  1:00pm - 8:00pm, 11:00am - 11:00pm\nTue:  1:00pm - 8:00pm, 11:00am - 11:00pm\nWed:  1:00pm - 8:00pm, 11:00am - 11:00pm\nThu:  1:00pm - 8:00pm, 11:00am - 11:00pm\nFri:  11:00am - 10:00pm, 11:00am - 1:00am\nSat:  11:00am - 10:00pm, 11:00am - 11:00am\nSun:  12:00pm - 6:00pm, 11:00am - 10:00pm\n\n","latitude":39.0963619,"longitude":-84.5087017,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"restaurant","locationTypeDisplay":"Restaurant\/Ale House","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-02 18:10:31","updateDate":"2014-12-15 02:46:10","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"PaIgbA","name":"OA","nameDisplay":"OA","description":"The Oaked Amber is a blend of a fresh batch of Long Face Amber Ale and a year old batch of Schwarzbier, double oaked in a used bourban cask and freshly charred white oak staves.

We set sail in December 2009, during the height of a global economic storm, and have quickly become one of the fastest growing breweries in Washington, with our beer is now sacking and pillaging cities throughout Washington and British Columbia. We have taken a different tack than many new brewers, and rather than going for a number of very big, single batch beers, we are focused on food-friendly beers in a smaller lineup that is readily available year round. We realized a long time ago that food-friendly by no means needs to be less flavorful, and we actually add ingredients to widen the palate of our beers above and beyond their original styles.\r\n\r\nTo better integrate with a meal and make our beers more \u2018sessionable\u2019 in general, we utilize highly attenuating yeasts to dry out our beers to make them less sweet and filling, then replace that desired sweetness with an addition outside the norm, such as Juniper, Ginger or even Angelica. These ingredients are always kept at a level to avoid building a \u2018spice beer\u2019, and always present themselves as a unique and complementary addition. We also focus on extremely clean finishes, and use the entire recipe to build bittering rather than just using the hops to reduce lingering starchiness.\r\n\r\nIn the end, the true beauty of any flavor is in the eye (and mouth) of the beholder. Read about our beers here, then taste them at your local restaurant or store and judge for yourself if we have truly crafted \u2018Great Beer Designed With Great Food In Mind\u2019.
