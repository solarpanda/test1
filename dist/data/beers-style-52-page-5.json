While large macro-breweries compete to produce the lightest, most flavorless, adjunct laden beers possible, craft breweries strive to out-do one another by making each beer hoppier, bolder, and stronger than the next.  At Brevard Brewing Company, we have set out to give beer lovers the best of both worlds \u2013 beer that is both drinkable and flavorful.  We are the only brewery in Western North Carolina to specialize in lagers. \r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s the big deal about lagers? Lagers are cold-fermented and aged over twice as long as ales.  They are more costly to produce, and take more patience to brew. Unlike the big flavors of ales that hide imperfections, lagers demand a higher standard of quality and care, making them a rare find in the craft beer world.  But the result is worth the attention to detail--this painstaking process creates a beer that is clean, smooth, and crisp as opposed to the bold, complex flavor of ales.  The imported German barley, hops, and yeast delivers delicate and refined beers that are delicious and flavorful, yet supremely drinkable.\r\n\r\nWhile German-inspired lagers are my specialty, I will never forget the wonderful contributions that American home brewers have made to the beer world over the past thirty years.  I typically find myself drinking a cold, smooth, Pilsner, but every now and again, my taste buds crave a bold, hoppy American IPA.  This is why Brevard Brewing Company offers American ales in addition to German lagers.  No matter your mood or what you are craving, we have the right beer for you.","website":"http:\/\/www.brevard-brewing.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/enoxkn\/upload_efjDQ2-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/enoxkn\/upload_efjDQ2-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/enoxkn\/upload_efjDQ2-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/enoxkn\/upload_efjDQ2-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/enoxkn\/upload_efjDQ2-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-15 23:03:43","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:28:05","locations":[{"id":"ktgW91","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"63 East Main Street","locality":"Brevard","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"28712","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\nTue:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\nWed:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\nThu:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\nFri:  2:00pm - 12:00am\nSat:  2:00pm - 12:00am\nSun:  2:00pm - 9:00pm\n\nMonday-Thursday:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\r\nFriday & Saturday: 2:00pm - 12:00am\r\nSunday: 2:00pm - 9:00pm","latitude":35.2333243,"longitude":-82.7333116,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-15 23:04:50","updateDate":"2014-09-29 20:36:32","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"xFNQch","name":"Munich Dunkel","nameDisplay":"Munich Dunkel","description":"Originally brewed in Munich, this classic dark lager has become quite popular throughout Germany.

The philosophy was to bring an appreciation of craft beer to the north with product education and creativity.  The process of appreciation through education we call beer liberation.\r\n\r\nToday Short\u2019s Brewing Company continues the effort to educate and liberate consumers.  We take pride in our hands on, mom and pop approach and the energy we put into the quality of our beer, food, staff, customers and facilities. We believe in the power of the smallness.   We intend on remaining a smaller, state wide beer distributor and focusing our energies close to home (the SBC Michigan stimulus package).

Big Muddy Brewing in Murphysboro, Illinois is much like many of these new \u201cmicrobreweries\u201d all over the country, reinvigorating an industry and continuing a heritage that has skipped several generations.\r\nUntil 1940, Murphysboro was the home of a thriving brewery and until prohibition; it was one of the cornerstones of the town\u2019s industry. In 1910, the Stecher Brewing Company produced more than 40,000 barrels of beer a year. However, passage of the Volstead Act in 1919, which ushered in the era of prohibition, began a slow decline to the brewery\u2019s demise.\r\nBig Muddy Brewing\u2019s founder Chuck Stuhrenberg attended Southern Illinois University Carbondale in the 1980s. After graduation, he opened a franchise of Chicago\u2019s Rosati\u2019s Pizza in Carbondale and in 1990, began another venture, Spray Shield Industries.\r\nIt was while Stuhrenberg was in college at SIU that he began making his own beer.\r\nStuhrenberg and his college buddies would homebrew, and as the years went on, he began to take his hobby more seriously.\r\nStuhrenberg always had professional brewing in the back of his mind, but it stayed a hobby until 2009. In July, 2009, Big Muddy Brewing finally began production, the first brewery in Murphysboro in over 50 years.\r\nThe first beer offered by Big Muddy Brewing is Kinkaid Wheat. It was a recipe popular with Stuhrenberg\u2019s family and friends. It was also something he felt would be a good \u201ccraft beer transition brew\u201d for those used to the conventional corporate brew (BMC).\r\nKinkaid Wheat is currently offered on tap and by bottle in bars, restaurants and liquor stores across Southern Illinois alongside of Big Muddy Brewing\u2019s second selection, \u201cSaluki Dunkel Dog\u201d, a dark, amber\/dunkel style beer.\r\nThe third and newest addition to Big Muddy Brewing\u2019s lineup is an ale called \u201cBig Muddy Pale Ale\u201d, and future varieties include \u201cLogan\u2019s Lager\u201d.","website":"http:\/\/www.bigmuddybrewing.com\/","established":"2009","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/oBe8dQ\/upload_W7yNNA-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/oBe8dQ\/upload_W7yNNA-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/oBe8dQ\/upload_W7yNNA-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/oBe8dQ\/upload_W7yNNA-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/oBe8dQ\/upload_W7yNNA-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:46","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:18:15","locations":[{"id":"QkdgSV","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1430 North 7th Street","locality":"Murphysboro","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"62966","phone":"(618) 684-8833","website":"http:\/\/www.bigmuddybrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sat: 11:00 am - 3:00 pm\r\n`","latitude":37.7823381,"longitude":-89.3321145,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2009","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:46","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"vijBHy","name":"Samson Crystal Diplomat Dark Beer","nameDisplay":"Samson Crystal Diplomat Dark Beer","styleId":52,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:44:09","updateDate":"2015-06-06 19:25:37","style":{"id":52,"categoryId":4,"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"South German-Style Dunkel Weizen \/ Dunkel Weissbier","shortName":"Dunkelweizen","description":"This beer style is characterized by a distinct sweet maltiness and a chocolate-like character from roasted malt.

This traditional yeast is rarely used by American brewers so the flavors it creates are often unfamiliar, even to craft beer drinkers.  The yeast character is complemented by the taste of the malted wheat that adds a cereal note. The result is a beer that, although quite complex and flavorful, is medium in body, with a crisp finish.","abv":"5.1","ibu":"13","glasswareId":5,"srmId":20,"availableId":4,"styleId":52,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/21EI3F\/upload_rsaDej-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/21EI3F\/upload_rsaDej-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/21EI3F\/upload_rsaDej-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"The spicy, aromatic Dunkelweizen matches flavorful Mexican dishes perfectly.

We've worked hard and are incredibly proud of the many successes we've enjoyed over the years. The Boston Beer Company has been cited as one of the best companies to work for by Boston Magazine, one of the Best Entry-Level Jobs by The Princeton Review, and our beers have won more awards than any other in history. Jim has been named an \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" by Inc. Magazine. Our brewers keep amazing us with innovative new brews, including Samuel Adams Utopias and our Samuel Adams Barrel Room Collection.\r\n\r\nJim has believed from the beginning that the more you know and understand about beer, the more you'll appreciate a beer like Samuel Adams Boston Lager. To begin that mission, all new employees go through intensive training on everything from ingredients, brewing, and beer styles, to taking care of the beer once it leaves the brewery. We're all beer lovers and protectors of the beer so we're trained how to identify off flavors and how to troubleshoot the causes. The passion for beer continues with an annual homebrew competition that we all take part in.\r\n\r\nOne of our wholesalers once asked Jim why he invested so much in training his people, when ultimately they might leave. Jim smiled and replied without hesitation: \"What if I didn't train them, and they stayed?\"\r\n\r\nEach year, usually in January, everyone gathers together. One of the highlights of the meeting is the beer trivia contest. With a culture so steeped in beer education and knowledge, winning is a pretty big deal. Recently, one of the hotel bartenders who was watching as the various teams arrived in costume with music and much enthusiasm and fanfare, said, \"I've always known Samuel Adams made the best beer in America, but now I see this is the greatest company in America.\" When you look around you see that The Boston Beer Company is a team of enthusiastic people who are passionate about beer and who really love coming to work every day to provide American drinkers with the best beer possible.\r\n\r\nThe Boston Beer Company, Inc. is a publicly-traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol, SAM.","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","established":"1984","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:24:45","locations":[{"id":"DF5YsC","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"30 Germania Street","locality":"Boston","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"02130","phone":"1-800-372-1131","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","latitude":42.314449,"longitude":-71.103365,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1984","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2015-12-02 19:22:03","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"MLUbXI","name":"Cincinnati","streetAddress":"1625 Central Parkway","locality":"Cincinnati","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45214","phone":"513-412-3200","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","latitude":39.1144986,"longitude":-84.5222061,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-12 13:10:57","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"XZ6L8a","name":"Production Brewery","streetAddress":"7880 Penn Drive","locality":"Breinigsville","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"18031","latitude":40.5759622,"longitude":-75.6290377,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2007","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-11-30 20:24:56","updateDate":"2015-12-02 19:22:03","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"SVBAGa","name":"Sanwald Dunkelweizen","nameDisplay":"Sanwald Dunkelweizen","styleId":52,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:44:09","updateDate":"2015-05-14 18:09:10","style":{"id":52,"categoryId":4,"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"South German-Style Dunkel Weizen \/ Dunkel Weissbier","shortName":"Dunkelweizen","description":"This beer style is characterized by a distinct sweet maltiness and a chocolate-like character from roasted malt.

John and Aaron met at church through their kids, who were (and still are) best friends. The kids would plan brew days at Aaron's house so they could play together, and John and Aaron could brew. John had started brewing on a beer kit and Aaron taught him the art of brewing all grain beers on his home made system. The planning of Tin Cannon came through many days of brewing with together in Aaron's dedicated brew room, or in John's garage. Aaron is an engineering guru and built a tremendous 10 gallon brewing system on his own, to include an electric master control panel. John likes to tinker and build stuff, and built stir plates, mash tuns, a kegerator and the like. When two innovative minds get together, they bring ingenuity, focus, style and creativity to each beer they brew.
