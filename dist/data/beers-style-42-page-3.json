St. Boniface saw the unconverted Saxons worshiping Thor and knew something must be done.

With fierce and repeated blows he leveled the massive tree; those around him feared God and were converted to Christianity.\r\n\r\nThe deed of Boniface provides an elegant analogy for our own mission at Saint Boniface Craft Brewing Co. Mike and Jon have witnessed many beer \u201cpagans\u201d worshiping the false gods of the big beer industry and see that it is time to take a Boniface-like swing at converting some of those people to a better way of life, one full of rich, tasty, more satisfying brews.","website":"http:\/\/www.stbonifacebrewing.com\/","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TVCOly\/upload_IAAumV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TVCOly\/upload_IAAumV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TVCOly\/upload_IAAumV-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TVCOly\/upload_IAAumV-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TVCOly\/upload_IAAumV-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2016-04-14 15:21:57","locations":[{"id":"0o5iQ6","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1701 West Main Street","locality":"Ephrata","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"17522","phone":"717-466-6900","website":"www.stbonifacebrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Tuesday: 4:00PM - 9:00PM\r\nWednesday: 4:00PM - 9:00PM\r\nThursday: 11:00AM - 9:00PM\r\nFriday: 11:00AM - 9:00PM\r\nSaturday: 11:00AM - 9:00PM","latitude":40.200468,"longitude":-76.205418,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2015-06-15 20:28:24","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"RXXZq8","name":"Black Diamond Imperial Porter","nameDisplay":"Black Diamond Imperial Porter","styleId":42,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:50","updateDate":"2012-03-22 13:04:39","style":{"id":42,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Stout","shortName":"American Stout","description":"Initial low to medium malt sweetness with a degree of caramel, chocolate and\/or roasted coffee flavor with a distinctive dryroasted bitterness in the finish.

Through the years the company has grown from a three person operation to a staff of almost 50, from about 4,000 to 35,000 square feet, and from a capacity to brew 2,000 barrels annually to almost 40,000. Those of you who saw the old brewery may remember the retrofitted dairy equipment we used. We held on to two of those tanks in our move to the East Asheville location. Alongside them, we have new fermentation and brite beer tanks to go with our 50-barrel brew house. Our pilot brew house is a brewer's playground for developing new seasonal beers, high gravity brews, and whatever else the brewers dream up. Highland currently supplies both Carolinas, Georgia, Tennessee, Florida, Alabama, Ohio, Kentucky and Virginia.

Nick and Simon brewed intense balanced beers that were and still remain \u201cnot normal\u201d by conventional standards.\r\n\r\nIn November of 2005, after receiving numerous visitors to the brewery over the years, Three Floyds opened its own brewpub at the production facility. What was once office space is now a refuge for the craft beer enthusiast. With all the Three Floyds mainstays, seasonal offerings, special small batch beers and many guest beers it is a mecca for craft beer. The pub also has a full service kitchen providing pub fare of the best quality supported by a 3000 square foot organic herb and vegetable garden.","website":"http:\/\/www.3floyds.com","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/iodDki\/upload_Va4zor-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/iodDki\/upload_Va4zor-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/iodDki\/upload_Va4zor-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/iodDki\/upload_Va4zor-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/iodDki\/upload_Va4zor-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2016-01-15 16:17:52","locations":[{"id":"71LkGn","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"9750 Indiana Parkway","locality":"Munster","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"46321","phone":"1-219-922-3565","website":"http:\/\/www.threefloydspub.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nTue:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nWed:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nThu:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nFri:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nSat:  12:00pm - 2:00am\r\nSun:  12:00pm - 12:00am","latitude":41.535541,"longitude":-87.516686,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2015-06-18 14:42:36","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"GoDmMT","name":"Munster","streetAddress":"9750 Indiana Parkway","locality":"Munster","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"46321","phone":"219-922-4425","website":"http:\/\/www.3floyds.com\/","latitude":41.535536,"longitude":-87.516687,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:16","updateDate":"2015-04-01 18:55:51","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"cPc4Hw","name":"Black Tail Stout","nameDisplay":"Black Tail Stout","description":"This is a non-traditional sweet stout, that has a chocolaty note and a good smooth roasted coffee finish.
