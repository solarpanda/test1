Rogue's first brewpub was located in Ashland, Oregon and was a 10bbl brewsystem. Rogue opened a second brewpub, 15bbl brewsystem, in May 1989 located in Newport, Oregon. Rogue closed its Ashland operation in 1997, after the great flood destroyed the place. In 1991, the 15bbl system, named Howard after John Maier's former boss, from the Newport brewpub was transferred across the bay to the current brewery and upgraded to a 30bbl system. In 1998 Rogue bought a 50bbl brewsystem, named Kobe. Kobe is the only brewsystem in use. Tours: We offer brewery tours every day at 3 pm (followed by a distillery tour at 4pm). Go up to the bar inside the brewery (Brewers on the Bay) and check in with the bartender and the tour will commence. Please call ahead if you have a large group and or to verify the tour time...Brewer's on the Bay phone is 541-867-3664.

The first hops were grown in 1004 and the brewing followed shortly. The combination of the dark red soil, rich in ferrous oxide (which retains water) and climate allows the region to produce the award winning crop.\r\nThe Zatec brewery - built in 1801 - is situated inside the Zatec castle walls, overlooking the town and hop fields.\r\nThe brewery suffered for lack of investment during the Communist years until by 2000 the brew was hardly available even locally, much to the detriment of the Zatec economy. In year 2001 Rolf Munding purchased the brewery from a local business man and began a program of investment which has rejuvenated the brewery and improved the prospects for the beer, brewery and the people of Zatec, both as beer drinkers and brewers.\r\nTomas Lejsek, one of Czech Republic\u2019s leading and most innovative brew masters has masterminded the changes, bringing together new technology, old brewing processes and pure ingredients.","website":"http:\/\/www.zatec-brewery.com\/","established":"1801","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ABR6Y1\/upload_lJftrM-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ABR6Y1\/upload_lJftrM-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ABR6Y1\/upload_lJftrM-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ABR6Y1\/upload_lJftrM-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ABR6Y1\/upload_lJftrM-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-10-31 11:30:08","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:38:33","locations":[{"id":"GOh8Oi","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"\u017dateck\u00fd pivovar, spol. s r.o., \u017di\u017ekovo n\u00e1m\u011bst\u00ed 81,","region":"\u017datec","postalCode":"438 01","phone":"+420 415 710 783","website":"http:\/\/www.zatec-brewery.com\/","latitude":50.313918,"longitude":13.534263,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"CZ","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-10-31 11:31:40","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"CZ","name":"CZECH REPUBLIC","displayName":"Czech Republic","isoThree":"CZE","numberCode":203,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"xFASmG","name":"Lahko Lasko","nameDisplay":"Lahko Lasko","abv":"3","styleId":77,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-04 18:06:41","updateDate":"2013-05-05 15:01:19","style":{"id":77,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"German-Style Leichtbier","shortName":"Leichtbier","description":"These beers are very light in body and color.
