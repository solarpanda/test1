They are our beloved folks out in the field. Spanning all 29 of our states from the Pacific to the Atlantic, our Beer Rangers do their best to protect, to pour and to partake. And explore many a beer from many a brewery, they do. \r\n\r\nBring out the hops! This clear amber beauty bursts at the starting gate with an abundance of hops: Cascade (citrus), Chinook (floral\/citrus), and Simcoe (fruity) lead off the beer, with Cascade added again for an intense dry hop flavor. Brewed with pale and dark caramel malts that harmonize the hop flavor from start to finish, Ranger is a sessionable splendor for all you hopinistas.

As our aspiring young homebrewer rides his mountain bike with fat tires through European villages famous for beer, New Belgium Brewing Company was but a glimmer in his eye. Or basement. For Jeff Lebesch would return to Fort Collins with a handful of ingredients and an imagination full of recipes. And then there was beer. Jeff's first two basement-brewed creations? A brown dubbel with earthy undertones named Abbey and a remarkably well-balanced amber he named Fat Tire. To say the rest was history would be to overlook his wife's involvement. Kim Jordan was New Belgium's first bottler, sales rep, distributor, marketer and financial planner.

It didn't take long before the act, the ideas, and the processes of brewing began to take over our lives. Shortly thereafter we dubbed ourselves Black Pond Brews, after a pond where we had some fun and memorable times in Woodstock, CT. Within no time we were entering our beers into homebrew competitions and they were met with immediate success. Spurred by this success and by the constant clamoring of our friends and family to make more beer, we really began to ask ourselves: how do we turn this passion for producing beer into a commercial reality?\r\n \r\nOur project is not only valuable to us, but to the community in which we will operate.  Our beautiful, quiet town of Danielson, CT will become a destination for anyone who loves beer, be they local or travellers.  Who doesn't love beer?  Further, who doesn't love MORE beer to try?!\r\n \r\nWhat inspires us?\r\nThe ability to write or create something unique, something revolutionary. Clara Barton once said \u201cI defy the tyranny of precedent. I go for anything new that might improve the past\". Such a philosophy is inherent in the way we approach brewing. Breweries often spend much of their time and effort looking back to past recipes- often times as far back as the inception of brewing itself- but what of the future? What new ideas and flavors can we explore? We are always pushing the envelope against the grain- but our guiding star will always be uncompromising flavor of the highest quality.","website":"http:\/\/www.blackpondbrews.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/RBaOzm\/upload_V4dCw0-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/RBaOzm\/upload_V4dCw0-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/RBaOzm\/upload_V4dCw0-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/RBaOzm\/upload_V4dCw0-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/RBaOzm\/upload_V4dCw0-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-05-17 11:34:47","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:09:03","locations":[{"id":"t8ecnf","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"21A Furnace St","locality":"Danielson","region":"Connecticut","postalCode":"06239","phone":"860-207-5295","website":"BlackPondBrews.com","hoursOfOperation":"Thu:  5:00pm - 8:00pm\nFri:  5:00pm - 8:00pm\nSat:  3:00pm - 8:00pm\nSun:  12:00pm - 5:00pm\n\nWe are located in the basement of the beautiful Danielson Adventure Sports Building.","latitude":41.804121,"longitude":-71.883942,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"nano","locationTypeDisplay":"Nano Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-05-17 11:34:47","updateDate":"2015-05-18 14:49:59","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"c4BFZW","name":"RBC Rye IPA Ale","nameDisplay":"RBC Rye IPA Ale","styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/c4BFZW\/upload_RffJeH-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/c4BFZW\/upload_RffJeH-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/c4BFZW\/upload_RffJeH-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-03 12:30:28","updateDate":"2015-12-17 09:19:39","style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

My family was no different. I grew up hearing stories that cascaded across a broad plain of topics, but the ones that fascinated me most centered around the Kingsbury Breweries.\r\n\r\nBack in 1926, the Kingsbury Breweries, then known as the Gutsch Brewery, declared bankruptcy. It was a tough time for breweries across the country as Prohibition was in full effect. Many breweries failed during that time, and the Gutsch Brewery was on its way to joining them. It was at this time that my family took the helm of the brewery. Soon after, they changed the name to the Kingsbury Breweries, expanded coast-to-coast, and turned the brewery into what we remember it as today.\r\n\r\nI grew up hearing stories from my father, who, as a child with his father, would go around the various Kingsbury Breweries, see the brewers hard at work, and watch the customers enjoy a beer in the Ratskellar. This is where my interest was first piqued by the great world of beer. Many years later, thanks to a brilliant gift on my wife\u2019s part, I started making my own beer. From that point forward there was no turning back. The hobby turned into a passion, which turned into an obsession, which turned into quitting my day job and opening a brewery.\r\n\r\nThis is my Really Cool Waterslide - my choice to take a dream and make it my reality.

My family was no different. I grew up hearing stories that cascaded across a broad plain of topics, but the ones that fascinated me most centered around the Kingsbury Breweries.\r\n\r\nBack in 1926, the Kingsbury Breweries, then known as the Gutsch Brewery, declared bankruptcy. It was a tough time for breweries across the country as Prohibition was in full effect. Many breweries failed during that time, and the Gutsch Brewery was on its way to joining them. It was at this time that my family took the helm of the brewery. Soon after, they changed the name to the Kingsbury Breweries, expanded coast-to-coast, and turned the brewery into what we remember it as today.\r\n\r\nI grew up hearing stories from my father, who, as a child with his father, would go around the various Kingsbury Breweries, see the brewers hard at work, and watch the customers enjoy a beer in the Ratskellar. This is where my interest was first piqued by the great world of beer. Many years later, thanks to a brilliant gift on my wife\u2019s part, I started making my own beer. From that point forward there was no turning back. The hobby turned into a passion, which turned into an obsession, which turned into quitting my day job and opening a brewery.\r\n\r\nThis is my Really Cool Waterslide - my choice to take a dream and make it my reality.
