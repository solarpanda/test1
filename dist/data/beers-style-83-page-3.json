Cousins William Knaust and Martin Heubisch opened the Cass River Brewery just north of the Fallier property in 1862, where the Frankenmuth Brewery continues to stand today.\r\n\r\nThe Cass River Brewery was purchased by Johann Geyer in 1874, and renamed Geyer\u2019s Brothers Brewing Co. For the next 112 years, the facility operated under many names including the Frankenmuth Brewing Co. Ferdinand \u201cFred\u201d Schumacher from Duseldorf, Germany, purchased the brewery one year before a fire destroyed most of the structure in 1987.\r\n\r\nThe microbrewery continued operation following ownership acquisition by Randall E. Heine in 1990. The nation\u2019s second oldest microbrewery was at peak production in 1996, distributing more than 30,000 barrels of locally produced microbrews across 25 states, when a F3 tornado struck our facility, causing several million dollars of damage. A brew pub was opened in 2003 and closed three years later.\r\n\r\nOur Frankenmuth Brewing Company, housed in the historic four story, 28,000 square foot building is an exciting destination for food lovers and beer aficionados alike.","website":"http:\/\/frankenmuthbrewery.com\/","established":"1862","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/xUwGtE\/upload_1DNBW7-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/xUwGtE\/upload_1DNBW7-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/xUwGtE\/upload_1DNBW7-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/xUwGtE\/upload_1DNBW7-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/xUwGtE\/upload_1DNBW7-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:11:49","locations":[{"id":"IgdWNj","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"425 S Main Street","locality":"Frankenmuth","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"48734","phone":"989-262-8300","website":"http:\/\/frankenmuthbrewery.com\/","latitude":43.330981,"longitude":-83.737896,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1862","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"9lCQIV","name":"Munich Dunkel","nameDisplay":"Munich Dunkel","styleId":83,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:44","updateDate":"2015-05-27 21:23:23","style":{"id":83,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"European-Style Dark \/ M\u00fcnchner Dunkel","shortName":"Euro Dark","description":"These light brown to dark brown beers have a pronounced malty aroma and flavor that dominates over the clean, crisp, moderate hop bitterness.

The equinox, and the intrigue of equal night and day, has deep roots in history and ritual. But, at the same time, the equinox marks the changing of the season, and forces us to look toward the future. We find it interesting that the two days out of the year that have perfect light and dark balance also show the balance between the past and the future, tradition and innovation. Beer contains similar elements. Sure, there\u2019s the balance of flavors in a beer; sweet and bitter, rich and simple\u2026\r\n\r\nWe find another aspect of beer\u2019s balancing act fascinating. Historically, beer styles have developed because of limitations in local ingredients and the necessity to make do with what you have. However, due to global trade and modern shipping methods, limitations on ingredients have been removed. We can get any ingredients we want. While most modern brewers recognize the importance of beer styles and learn from the brewers who made them, they certainly don\u2019t limit themselves to making beers that fit into traditional definitions.\r\n\r\nOn one level our beers fit into some traditional styles, but we put our own twist on them. We want our beers to capture elements from the past and incorporate new ideas, ingredients and techniques into them. We\u2019re not afraid to try new things.\r\n\r\nAs a brewer, its playtime and work, balanced.","website":"http:\/\/www.equinoxbrewing.com\/","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wYyIFx\/upload_iB5vAJ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wYyIFx\/upload_iB5vAJ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wYyIFx\/upload_iB5vAJ-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wYyIFx\/upload_iB5vAJ-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wYyIFx\/upload_iB5vAJ-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:07:44","locations":[{"id":"YKa9wh","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"133 Remington Street","locality":"Fort Collins","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"80524","phone":"970-430-6489","website":"http:\/\/www.equinoxbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  12:00pm - 8:00pm\nTue:  12:00pm - 8:00pm\nWed:  12:00pm - 8:00pm\nThu:  12:00pm - 9:00pm\nFri:  12:00pm - 10:00pm\nSat:  11:00am - 10:00pm\nSun:  12:00pm - 7:00pm\n\n","latitude":40.586331,"longitude":-105.0757067,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2010","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2014-12-03 19:58:04","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"ItkrVU","name":"Noch Einmal Dunkel","nameDisplay":"Noch Einmal Dunkel","styleId":83,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:46","updateDate":"2015-06-06 20:11:12","style":{"id":83,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"European-Style Dark \/ M\u00fcnchner Dunkel","shortName":"Euro Dark","description":"These light brown to dark brown beers have a pronounced malty aroma and flavor that dominates over the clean, crisp, moderate hop bitterness.

After returning to the states, they had trouble finding that type of beer in Chicago so they opened Two Brothers Brewing Company in 1996. To get them started, the brothers' grandfather, a retired dairy farmer, donated his bulk milk tanks, which were quickly converted to fermenters. Currently, the brewery resides in a 40,000 square foot facility 30 miles west of Chicago. In addition to their traditional style beers, Two Brothers Brewing Company produces many specialty beers including the Project Opus Sour series. Adjacent to the brewery, Two Brothers Tap House opened in 2008 as a restaurant which serves elevated, seasonal, and organic American pub fare. In 2011, the Ebel brothers purchased Walter Payton's Roundhouse located in Aurora, IL. The Two Brothers Roundhouse is a full service brewpub restaurant, music venue, offers banquet space for large parties and weddings and hosts the Two Brothers Cafe and Beer Bar! \r\n\r\nTwo Brothers Brewing Company's award winning products are currently available in Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Florida, New York, Iowa and Missouri.","website":"http:\/\/www.TwoBrothersBrewing.com\/","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Cu5xXG\/upload_FFc22Y-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Cu5xXG\/upload_FFc22Y-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Cu5xXG\/upload_FFc22Y-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Cu5xXG\/upload_FFc22Y-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Cu5xXG\/upload_FFc22Y-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:01:21","locations":[{"id":"jeOXxz","name":"Two Brothers Tap House","streetAddress":"30 w 315 Calumet Ave.","locality":"Warrenville","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60555","phone":"630.393.2337","website":"http:\/\/www.twobrotherstaphouse.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday        3:00 - 11:00\r\nTuesday        3:00 - 11:00\r\nWednesday   3:00 - 11:00\r\nThursday      3:00 - 11:00\r\nFriday         12:00 - 12:00\r\nSaturday     12:00 - 12:00\r\nSunday        12:00 - 9:00","latitude":41.824453,"longitude":-88.212512,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2015-07-14 13:53:02","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"YOdPoo","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"30W315 Calumet Ave.","locality":"Warrenville","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60555","website":"http:\/\/www.twobrosbrew.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"We are give tours EVERY Saturday at 1:00 and 2:30 and Sunday at 1:00.","latitude":41.824906,"longitude":-88.211221,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2012-01-26 12:57:18","updateDate":"2015-07-07 21:22:36","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"AiMDyF","name":"Two Brothers Roundhouse","streetAddress":"205 N.

Obviously, by making beer the brave soldier Seppel was of much better use to the King of Sweden, because he was going lame due to an old battlefield injury to the leg. The injury was the cause for his nickname \u201cSchlappe-Seppel\u201d.\r\n\r\nThe beer of the brave soldier was very well received because of its excellence and very soon after the first brew, he had to make more beer. In the end, he stayed behind in Aschaffenburg, after the Swedish troops had left. He settled as a cooper and brewer.

A cornerstone from the original mill was placed in the new building.

As a result, the original brown bottle colour was changed to green.","website":"http:\/\/www.steinlager.com\/","established":"1957","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/6sHf19\/upload_Lf68eH-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/6sHf19\/upload_Lf68eH-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/6sHf19\/upload_Lf68eH-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/6sHf19\/upload_Lf68eH-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/6sHf19\/upload_Lf68eH-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-03 00:27:35","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:30:31","locations":[{"id":"v8SqHO","name":"Lion Brewery","streetAddress":"55 Ormiston Road","extendedAddress":"Flatbush","locality":"Auckland","website":"http:\/\/www.steinlager.co.nz\/","latitude":-36.9634165,"longitude":174.895644,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"macro","locationTypeDisplay":"Macro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"NZ","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-01-27 01:47:56","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"NZ","name":"NEW ZEALAND","displayName":"New Zealand","isoThree":"NZL","numberCode":554,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"MN6MGd","name":"St. Pauli Girl Special Dark","nameDisplay":"St. Pauli Girl Special Dark","description":"Smooth beer with a light hop character and rich malty taste.","abv":"4.8","styleId":83,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-08-14 21:47:04","updateDate":"2015-08-14 21:47:04","style":{"id":83,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"European-Style Dark \/ M\u00fcnchner Dunkel","shortName":"Euro Dark","description":"These light brown to dark brown beers have a pronounced malty aroma and flavor that dominates over the clean, crisp, moderate hop bitterness.

A classic M\u00fcnchner Dunkel should have chocolate-like, roast malt, bread-like or biscuit-like aroma that comes from the use of Munich dark malt. Chocolate or roast malts can be used, but the percentage used should be minimal. Noble-type hop flavor and aroma should be low but perceptible. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Ale-like fruity esters and chill haze should not be perceived.","ibuMin":"16","ibuMax":"25","abvMin":"4.5","abvMax":"5","srmMin":"15","srmMax":"20","ogMin":"1.048","fgMin":"1.014","fgMax":"1.018","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:37:08"},"breweries":[{"id":"ftKoOQ","name":"Brauhaus am Waldschl\u00f6sschen","nameShortDisplay":"Brauhaus am Waldschl\u00f6sschen","description":"Brauhaus am Waldschl\u00f6sschen is a traditional restaurant for the whole family, a brewery experience and a cocktail bar.\r\n\r\nThe pleasant atmosphere and cosy hospitality simply demand that you stay awhile.
