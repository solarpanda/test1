Combining the relaxed ambience of a high-mountain brewery with uncompromising dedication to quality, Fitger\u2019s Brewhouse established a tradition of handcrafted beer, fantastic food and excellent entertainment on Lake Superior\u2019s North Shore.\r\n\r\nIn 2012 Fitger's Brewhouse won a bronze at the Great American Beer Festival for their Fitger\u2019s Framboise. In 2013 they have received multiple honors including \u201cBest Reason to Save the Growler\u201d by the Minneapolis Star Tribune, \u201cBest of the Lake\u201d by Lake Superior Magazine, and \u201cBest Brew\u201d by Duluth Superior Magazine.\r\n\r\nThis year Fitger's Brewhouse will produce more than 80 styles and nearly 3000 barrels of handcrafted beer. Our stage hosts eclectic local and touring entertainers six nights a week.","website":"http:\/\/brewhouse.net\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/LE4tZR\/upload_wu3TOc-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/LE4tZR\/upload_wu3TOc-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/LE4tZR\/upload_wu3TOc-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/LE4tZR\/upload_wu3TOc-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/LE4tZR\/upload_wu3TOc-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:19:11","locations":[{"id":"mSmGcW","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"600 E Superior St","locality":"Duluth","region":"Minnesota","postalCode":"55802","phone":"(218) 279-2739","website":"http:\/\/brewhouse.net\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon: 11:00 am - 12:00 am\r\nTue - Thu: 11:00 am - 1:00 am\r\nFri - Sat: 11:00 am - 2:00 am\r\nSun: 11:00 am - 12:00 am","latitude":46.7925523,"longitude":-92.0908537,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"4Iv8ob","name":"Big Slick","nameDisplay":"Big Slick","description":"Oatmeal Stout.

At the tender age of 13 both knew what they wanted to do for a living... make and drink good beer.  Just kidding!!\r\n\r\nTo make a long story short, Pete and Scot spent their formative years playing baseball at the West Middleton Town Hall.  Ever since, the words \"Town Hall\" evoke memories of community, relaxing with friends and happiness.  When Pete and Scot were reacquainted in Minneapolis they opened the Town Hall.\r\n\r\nTucked away on the fringes of downtown Minneapolis, the Town Hall offers a refreshing alternative to other eating and drinking establishments.  Its relaxed environment attracts a diverse crowd of college students, business people, professors, theater patrons and many more.\r\n\r\nThe Town Hall makes some of the best beer in America and provides an atmosphere where its patrons can relax and enjoy them.

The roasted, chocolate and caramel blend of flavors is subtle, not assertive with just enough hops to balance yet allow the malt sweetness to shine.

There are many variations of stouts available. You can find dry stouts, milk stouts, Imperial stouts, American stouts, and even stouts made with oats.\n\nAt the Church Brew Works we have crafted delicious Toasted Oatmeal Stout.  The oats were blended with the best barley malt we have \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2?\u00ac\u00e2?? and we didn\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2?\u00ac\u00e2?\u00a2t stop there.  To give this beer a wonderful roasted flavor, we added unmalted, very darkly roasted barley.  The roasted barley is mixed with a generous portion of chocolate colored malt giving the Blast Furnace Stout a beautiful ruby hue.\n\nWe used our finest hops unsparingly to create a delicately balanced bitterness with a rich roastiness and fresh hop aroma. The Fuggles and East Kent Goldings hops were added with heavy hands at two different times.  This unbridled addition grants a full hop flavor to our heavenly drink.\n\nA typical oatmeal stout is a bit lower in alcohol than most other stouts as does the Blast Furnace Stout.  Ours, though not typical, does have a welcome medium body.  As you drink this beer, notice the rich, creamy brown head.  Drink it slowly and savor the flavors.  We don\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2?\u00ac\u00e2?\u00a2t think you will be disappointed.
