Paul and Remy have over thirty years of combined experience in the wine industry. The old saying, \"it takes a lot of beer to make wine\" rings especially true for these long-time friends who have been brewing together since 2004, when they worked the grape harvest in New Zealand. Remy went on to study brewing at UC Davis and has experience working at a number of local breweries. Paul has been working at his family's winery in Dry Creek Valley since 2005.\r\n\r\nSonoma County was once one of the largest hop growing regions in the nation, but all that remains today are the ghostly shells of old hop-kilns. Paul has been experimenting with growing hops for years. This year, Paul and Remy hope to harvest 500 vines from hop yards in Sonoma County.","website":"http:\/\/fogbeltbrewing.com\/","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/sgkKky\/upload_z1V2oo-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/sgkKky\/upload_z1V2oo-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/sgkKky\/upload_z1V2oo-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/sgkKky\/upload_z1V2oo-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/sgkKky\/upload_z1V2oo-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-02-11 17:41:54","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:51:11","locations":[{"id":"jRzF7z","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1305 Cleveland Ave.","locality":"Santa Rosa","region":"California","postalCode":"95401","phone":"(707) 978-3400","website":"http:\/\/www.fogbeltbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Thursday 2-8pm\r\nFriday and Saturday 11-10pm\r\nSunday 11-8pm","latitude":38.448869,"longitude":-122.7265397,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-02-11 23:37:51","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Bz0Pex","name":"Assimilation","nameDisplay":"Assimilation","abv":"7.4","styleId":42,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-05-18 17:57:52","updateDate":"2016-05-18 17:57:52","style":{"id":42,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Stout","shortName":"American Stout","description":"Initial low to medium malt sweetness with a degree of caramel, chocolate and\/or roasted coffee flavor with a distinctive dryroasted bitterness in the finish.

What was once office space is now a refuge for the craft beer enthusiast. With all the Three Floyds mainstays, seasonal offerings, special small batch beers and many guest beers it is a mecca for craft beer.

If you look closely at the trunk of this old oak, you will notice the mark of an equal armed cross carved into its bark. The cross was carved sometime between 1775 and 1776 when Spanish Lt. Colonel Juan Batista de Anza led more than 240 men, women and children on an overland journey from the frontier New Spain to settle in Alta California. During that 1,200 mile journey, the very thirsty Colonel carved the cross to signify the perfect location for a brewery\u2026well, that\u2019s our story at Barrelhouse and we can\u2019t exactly prove it, but we\u2019re sticking to it!

Beer was the mission, and liberation was the movement.  With a lot of elbow grease, blind ambition and a little luck, the quest to create a community pub in Northwest Lower Michigan began to take shape.  The philosophy was to bring an appreciation of craft beer to the north with product education and creativity.  The process of appreciation through education we call beer liberation.\r\n\r\nToday Short\u2019s Brewing Company continues the effort to educate and liberate consumers.  We take pride in our hands on, mom and pop approach and the energy we put into the quality of our beer, food, staff, customers and facilities. We believe in the power of the smallness.   We intend on remaining a smaller, state wide beer distributor and focusing our energies close to home (the SBC Michigan stimulus package).
