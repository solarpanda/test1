The philosophy was to bring an appreciation of craft beer to the north with product education and creativity.  The process of appreciation through education we call beer liberation.\r\n\r\nToday Short\u2019s Brewing Company continues the effort to educate and liberate consumers.  We take pride in our hands on, mom and pop approach and the energy we put into the quality of our beer, food, staff, customers and facilities. We believe in the power of the smallness.   We intend on remaining a smaller, state wide beer distributor and focusing our energies close to home (the SBC Michigan stimulus package).

Our flagship beers such as Hop Gun IPA and Floridian Hefeweizen, also strive towards big, bold flavor.

The 20,000 sq-ft facility is powered by a 30-barrel, three-piece brewhouse, which feeds nearly 1000 gallons of beer per batch into our four 60-barrel fermenters - a capacity that makes us South Florida\u2019s largest craft microbrewery. Each of our distinctive beers is brewed using the finest, all-natural ingredients, then served up unpasteurized, unfiltered, and unfussed with. We offer tours of our 20,000 sq-ft facility, rotating food trucks nightly, and growlers of our brewery fresh beer to-go.\r\n\r\nYou can sample our creations in our spacious tap room - open 7 days a week, noon to midnight - as well as in bars and restaurants all across South Florida.

Soon after, we were introduced to our first Belgian style beers (Chimay, LaChouffe) and have been hooked on good beer ever since.  It progressed to the inevitable challenge of making our own home brew versions of the shared beers we loved and with the donation of our first brewing equipment from a friend, we started our beer making journey about 18 years ago.  From the beginning, we both found common ground having similar tastes in beer styles which progressed to a shared obsession of trying to figure out how our favorites were made.  We both shared in the fun of sharing our results with friends and watching their reactions, which kept us motivated to make more.  Now, I think we play to each other\u0080\u0099s strengths.  Mike is excited about the technical part of brewing and Greg enjoys determining flavor combinations and fun new things to try.  Our joint passion to make fun, creative craft beer coupled with our individual strengths makes a good brewing team that works well together.","website":"http:\/\/www.deviatebrewing.com\/","established":"2015","mailingListUrl":"mikeo@deviatebrewing.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/buQPij\/upload_0vHMMZ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/buQPij\/upload_0vHMMZ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/buQPij\/upload_0vHMMZ-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/buQPij\/upload_0vHMMZ-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/buQPij\/upload_0vHMMZ-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-09-08 20:40:16","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:16:05","locations":[{"id":"HB7F1d","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"4004 W. 96th St.","locality":"Indianapolis","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"46268","phone":"999-999-9999","website":"http:\/\/www.deviatebrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Fri:  5:00pm - 10:00pm\nSat:  12:00pm - 10:00pm\nSun:  12:00pm - 6:00pm\n\nMonday - Closed to brew\r\nTuesday - Closed to brew\r\nWednesday - Closed for now\r\nThursday - Closed for now\r\nFriday - 5 pm to 10 pm\r\nSaturday - Noon to 10 pm\r\nSunday - Noon to 6pm","latitude":39.9265355,"longitude":-86.2289472,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2015","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-09-08 20:42:35","updateDate":"2015-09-08 20:42:35","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"lu7gLH","name":"Lemon Sour","nameDisplay":"Lemon Sour","abv":"4","styleId":46,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-07-30 13:50:27","updateDate":"2015-07-30 13:50:27","style":{"id":46,"categoryId":4,"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Berliner-Style Weisse (Wheat)","shortName":"Berlinerweisse","description":"This is very pale in color and the lightest of all the German wheat beers.

Ayinger beers have been frequent award winners in international beer competitions.\r\n\r\nFor some years, a range of beer was brewed under the Ayingerbrau name by Samuel Smith's Brewery in Tadcaster, United Kingdom. Although the Ayinger logo was used, the recipes and range were different from those of the Ayinger Brewery. The arrangement ended in spring 2006, at which point Samuel Smith's rebranded the beers. Distribution of the Ayinger range of beer followed that summer. Because the Oktoberfest in Munich does not allow breweries outside its city limits to participate, Ayinger Brewery organizes many smaller festivals in the countryside around Munich.","website":"http:\/\/en.ayinger-bier.de\/","established":"1878","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QKdFk2\/upload_jjUvnX-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QKdFk2\/upload_jjUvnX-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QKdFk2\/upload_jjUvnX-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QKdFk2\/upload_jjUvnX-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QKdFk2\/upload_jjUvnX-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-28 16:51:35","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:36:51","locations":[{"id":"eqCbpj","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"M\u00fcnchner Stra\u00dfe 21","region":"Aying","postalCode":"D-85653","phone":"49080958890","isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-10-07 20:47:32","updateDate":"2014-10-07 20:47:32","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"6nglKU","name":"Lightning In A Bottle","nameDisplay":"Lightning In A Bottle","abv":"3.5","styleId":46,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-08-10 19:29:50","updateDate":"2015-08-10 19:47:08","style":{"id":46,"categoryId":4,"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Berliner-Style Weisse (Wheat)","shortName":"Berlinerweisse","description":"This is very pale in color and the lightest of all the German wheat beers.

The three talked about that it was too bad that you could not get some decent beer and agreed that the only way to ensure quality was about to brew it yourself. They were allowed to borrow the canteen in the school's closing and began to brew.

Since we came from very different backgrounds with diverse sets of experiences and talents, we joined forces to create beer that can be enjoyed not only by craft beer experts, but also by those who just want something tasty to drink after going for a bike ride.\r\n\r\nThough we all got to this point in our lives in different ways, we strongly agree on West Sixth\u2019s goals. We will provide a taproom and beer garden where the beer list is never the same but that is always local. We will be a brewery that measures its success not only by making great craft beer but also by how it helps our community. We will always strive to protect our environment even if it costs us more to do so. And last, but not least, we all share a desire to create the best beer possible and to be an integral part of building a great beer culture for our great town.","website":"http:\/\/www.westsixth.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QThKzg\/upload_wKo5YI-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QThKzg\/upload_wKo5YI-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QThKzg\/upload_wKo5YI-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QThKzg\/upload_wKo5YI-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QThKzg\/upload_wKo5YI-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-04-15 19:52:18","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:28:58","locations":[{"id":"8O2BuI","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"501 West Sixth Street","locality":"Lexington","region":"Kentucky","postalCode":"40508","phone":"859-951-6006","hoursOfOperation":"Monday \u2013 Thursday: 3pm \u2013 10pm\r\nFriday and Saturday: Noon \u2013 Midnight\r\nSunday: 1pm-6pm","latitude":38.059182,"longitude":-84.492095,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-04-15 19:53:38","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Kr7ZqR","name":"Miami Weiss","nameDisplay":"Miami Weiss","description":"A hoppy American wheat beer made with orange blossom honey, orange peel and Citra hops.

In its heyday, the hardware Co. was the center of community activity, selling everything from pots and pans to remedies for livestock maladies, chicken feed and of course, nuts and bolts.
