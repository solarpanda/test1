We started out modestly as Home Brew Mart in 1992. Our goal was to teach others how to brew quality handcrafted beer at home. In 1996 the brewery was installed by New World Brewing Systems in the space behind our retail store and production began in September. In May of 2005 we open our second brewery in Scripps Ranch.  We currently distribute five of our favorite beers, Yellowtail Pale Ale,  Calico Amber Ale , Big Eye I.P.A., Black Marlin Porter and Wahoo Wheat Beer to a thirsty San Diego.  Come to our brewery and we will gladly give you a tour and allow you to sample our newest selection of beers. Currently our beer is available in twelve ounce bottles to 15.5 gallon kegs. We also offer half gallon and gallon glass jugs to go. Kegs are available for rent to the public with a minimum deposit.  The name for our brewery comes from the point where Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo first set foot in California. Located on the Point Loma Peninsula, Ballast Point is considered the gateway to San Diego Harbor. Stones from this area were used as ballast in the cargo holds of sailing ships returning to the eastern seaboard. Many New England streets are still lined with the cobblestones brought back from San Diego.","website":"http:\/\/www.ballastpoint.com\/","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:45","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:39:04","locations":[{"id":"PckBjw","name":"Home Brew Mart","streetAddress":"5401 Linda Vista Road","extendedAddress":"#406","locality":"San Diego","region":"California","postalCode":"92110","phone":"(619) 295-2337","website":"http:\/\/www.ballastpoint.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Tasting Room & Store Hours\r\nMonday-Friday, 11:00-7:00\r\nSaturday-Sunday, 10:00-5:00","latitude":32.7667586,"longitude":-117.1952129,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:45","updateDate":"2014-09-29 20:33:49","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"a7VHpi","name":"Scripps Ranch Brewery","streetAddress":"10051 Old Grove Rd","locality":"San Diego","region":"California","postalCode":"92131","phone":"(858) 695-2739","website":"http:\/\/www.ballastpoint.com\/","latitude":32.898466,"longitude":-117.110794,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-12-07 00:05:42","updateDate":"2015-06-11 14:39:57","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"cLcfTf","name":"Tasting Room & Kitchen","streetAddress":"2215 India St","locality":"San Diego","region":"California","postalCode":"92101","phone":"(619) 255-7213","website":"http:\/\/www.ballastpoint.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  11:00am -

Established in 2003, its beer has gone on to be the most popular British bottled beer sold in Canada, and second most popular in Sweden. It was part of the nominated drinks list for the G8 Summit 2005 at Gleneagles Hotel.\r\n\r\nThe business is, since 2008, family owned following a management buy-out from its original part-owners, William Grant and Sons.\r\n\r\nTheir Innis & Gunn Original beer is brewed in Dunbar, East Lothian before being matured in American white oak Bourbon barrels for 30 days and is then a further 47 days in a marrying tun, and so it is matured for 77 days in total. It is 6.6% alcohol by volume. At first only available as a bottled beer it is now marketed both in bottles and as draught.\r\n\r\nAccording to Innis and Gunn's website, the process was discovered in an ironic accident: the intent was to create a scotch whisky with ale flavours. To do this, a special beer was created which would then be stored in the whisky barrels. After the beer had conditioned the barrels, it was to be discarded and replaced with the whisky. The brewers noted that the process had an agreeable effect on the beer, and thus aging the beer became an end in itself.\r\n\r\nA \"blonde\" version of Innis & Gunn is also widely available, and a limited edition matured in rum barrels was produced.","website":"http:\/\/www.innisandgunn.com\/","established":"2003","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jC0TAa\/upload_HlQFKB-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jC0TAa\/upload_HlQFKB-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jC0TAa\/upload_HlQFKB-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jC0TAa\/upload_HlQFKB-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jC0TAa\/upload_HlQFKB-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-03 00:34:11","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:30:32","locations":[{"id":"0HAazs","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"6 Randolph Crescent","region":"Edinburgh","postalCode":"EH3 7TH","phone":"+44 (0) 131 337 4420","website":"http:\/\/www.innisandgunn.com\/","latitude":55.951976,"longitude":-3.211095,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"GB","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-03 12:39:07","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"GB","name":"UNITED KINGDOM","displayName":"United Kingdom","isoThree":"GBR","numberCode":826,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"f2napY","name":"SB-X4 60 SCHILLING","nameDisplay":"SB-X4 60 SCHILLING","description":"Classic Scottish style ale served on Nitrogen gas.

Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made Scottishstyle light ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scottish-style light ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty\/smoky character may be evident at low levels (ales with medium or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category). Scottish-style light ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).","ibuMin":"9","ibuMax":"20","abvMin":"2.8","abvMax":"3.5","srmMin":"8","srmMax":"17","ogMin":"1.03","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.012","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:19:41"},"breweries":[{"id":"qqxm2J","name":"Williams Brothers Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Williams Brothers","description":"Scottish Craft Beer - Microbrewed For Maximum Flavour.
