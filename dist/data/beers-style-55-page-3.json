Nick and Simon brewed intense balanced beers that were and still remain \u201cnot normal\u201d by conventional standards.\r\n\r\nIn November of 2005, after receiving numerous visitors to the brewery over the years, Three Floyds opened its own brewpub at the production facility. What was once office space is now a refuge for the craft beer enthusiast. With all the Three Floyds mainstays, seasonal offerings, special small batch beers and many guest beers it is a mecca for craft beer.

'Altbier' literally means 'old beer,' referring to the era when Germans brewed ales instead of the lagers of today. The style is a bit of a hybrid of ale and lager in that it is brewed with an ale yeast, but is fermented at cooler than normal temperatures for an ale, and aged (lagered) before serving. The resulting beer has a pleasing malt character character, but is drier and not as heavy as most of our beers. The maltiness is balanced by a crisp hop character that is spicier than it is bitter. The fact that the hops are all of German origin accounts for this spicy hoppiness. The Amber is a deep copper color, which makes it an attractive as well as tasty brew. Available now through the summer. Also look for it in 22 oz. bottles at Portland's finer retail establishments.","abv":"5.2","ibu":"33","glasswareId":5,"availableId":4,"styleId":55,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:08","updateDate":"2012-03-22 13:05:17","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":55,"categoryId":4,"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"German-Style Altbier","shortName":"Altbier","description":"German-Style Altbiers are copper to dark brown ales, originally from the D\u00fcsseldorf area.
