Although the farm was fully operational and proving to be a success, the goods produced were sold on mainly a wholesale level to a Grand Rapids area packing house. Beginning in, 2010, we decided to expand our business and our dream. This is where the 3rd, 4th, and 5th generation of Sietsema Orchards & Cider Mill hope to thrive and grow. We are committed to providing quality produce, and by opening our doors to the public, providing a family farm experience that we hope you enjoy here in West Michigan.","website":"http:\/\/www.sietsemaorchards.com\/","established":"1954","mailingListUrl":"info@sietsemaorchards.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/hTqdRR\/upload_749LZL-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/hTqdRR\/upload_749LZL-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/hTqdRR\/upload_749LZL-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/hTqdRR\/upload_749LZL-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/hTqdRR\/upload_749LZL-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-11-03 17:23:04","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:01:03","locations":[{"id":"G9QOj4","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"8540 2 Mile Rd NE","locality":"Ada","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49301","hoursOfOperation":"September Hours:\r\nThursday & Friday 10am-6pm\r\nSaturday 9am-6pm\r\n\r\nOctober Hours:\r\nTuesday-Friday\r\n10am-6pm\r\nSaturday\r\n9am-6pm\r\n\r\nNovember Hours:\r\nThursday & Friday:\r\n10am-6pm\r\n\r\nSaturday:\r\n9-6","latitude":42.997611,"longitude":-85.459116,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"cidery","locationTypeDisplay":"Cidery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-11-03 17:25:32","updateDate":"2014-11-03 17:25:32","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"kSwlSB","name":"Rekorderlig Krusb\u00e4r (Gooseberry)","nameDisplay":"Rekorderlig Krusb\u00e4r (Gooseberry)","abv":"4.5","styleId":149,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-10-21 16:34:31","updateDate":"2012-10-21 16:34:32","style":{"id":149,"categoryId":12,"category":{"id":12,"name":"Mead, Cider, & Perry","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Common Cider","shortName":"Common Cider","description":"Variable, but should be a medium, refreshing drink.

The symbol of the Den Hoorn Brewery is proudly displayed in Stella Artois' cartouche to this day.\r\n\r\nSebastian Artois was admitted to the Leuven Brewer\u2019s Guild as a Brew Master in 1708, and only nine years later purchased the Den Hoorn brewery. In memoriam, you can find his last name on the brewery and every bottle of Stella Artois around the world.\r\n\r\nThe Artois Brewery was so beloved internationally and locally, a special batch was created as a Christmas gift to the people of Leuven. That special batch was the first to officially include \"Stella\" in its name. \"Stella\", meaning star in Latin, pays homage to this original occasion, accompanied by a star on every bottle.\r\n\r\nSo next time you see a bottle of Stella Artois, take note of the rich history paired with the rich flavor on and in every bottle.","website":"http:\/\/www.stellaartois.com\/","established":"1366","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/mIWMKP\/upload_bVYTEJ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/mIWMKP\/upload_bVYTEJ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/mIWMKP\/upload_bVYTEJ-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/mIWMKP\/upload_bVYTEJ-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/mIWMKP\/upload_bVYTEJ-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:48","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:41:42","locations":[{"id":"x5tPgB","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Vaartstraat 94","locality":"Leuven","region":"Vlaams Brabant","phone":"32-016-24-71-11","latitude":50.8870692,"longitude":4.7025108,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"BE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:48","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"BE","name":"BELGIUM","displayName":"Belgium","isoThree":"BEL","numberCode":56,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"9h6b3A","name":"Streak of Virtue","nameDisplay":"Streak of Virtue","abv":"6.3","styleId":149,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-08-11 22:45:20","updateDate":"2014-08-12 12:07:05","style":{"id":149,"categoryId":12,"category":{"id":12,"name":"Mead, Cider, & Perry","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Common Cider","shortName":"Common Cider","description":"Variable, but should be a medium, refreshing drink.

Most famous for the giant sand dunes and golden beaches of Sandbanks Provincial Park, the County also enjoys a dramatic history.\r\n\r\nFollowing the American Revolution of 1776 the Township of Marysburgh\u2014home to the County Cider Co.\u2014was one of many established for the settlement of United Empire Loyalists. Named in honour of Princess Mary, a daughter of King George III, it became home to a small group of disbanded German mercenaries under former Lieutenant Baron von Reitzenstein. This party, numbering about 40 persons, was one of the earliest German-speaking groups to settle in Ontario. By October 1784 they had begun to clear and cultivate the land. Henry David and his wife Elizabeth were among these early settlers and it was in 1830, that their son Conrad David, was given title to the lot, which the County Cider Co. now calls home.\r\n\r\nconradhouseToday, the 1832 Conrad David House is an area landmark. Set on the brow of the Waupoos escarpment, the stone house is an excellent example of Regency Cottage architecture. It features dramatic French doors, over-sized windows and veranda as well as a hipped roof. Next door, the property\u2019s picturesque 1832 stone barn houses the County Cider Co.\u2019s tasting room and retail store.
