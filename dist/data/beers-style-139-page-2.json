The start-up of production was dedicated to the 1980 Olympic Games.\r\n\r\nCzech experts were engaged in the project as world-renowned brewmasters. They were the ones who identified the construction site for the new brewery. The choice of construction site was determined by the main factor, namely the availability of huge reserves of soft, crystal-clear water. Today, the water from Jurassic bedrock (290 m) ensures the high quality of our products.\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards, the enterprise gave the impetus to developing the largest corporation in Ukraine to produce beer, low alcohol and soft drinks, and mineral water.\r\n\r\nThe plant received its current name only in 1986, after the district of Kyiv with the same name. The word \u2018Obolon\u2019 comes from the times of Kievan Rus, when it denoted low riverside meadows.\r\n\r\nBuilt according to a Czech design, the brewery produced beer that gained wide popularity. After Ukraine became independent, Obolon was the first corporation to export hopped beverages to Europe and the USA. Obolon trademark beer started being perceived as traditional Ukrainian beer in the whole world.\r\n\r\nAfter a quarter of a century, Obolon has evolved into a world-renowned trademark. Today people on five continents associate Obolon with Ukrainian beer #1.","website":"http:\/\/obolon.ua\/","established":"1980","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/8FRtPM\/upload_3LsfEK-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/8FRtPM\/upload_3LsfEK-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/8FRtPM\/upload_3LsfEK-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/8FRtPM\/upload_3LsfEK-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/8FRtPM\/upload_3LsfEK-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:04","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:06:53","locations":[{"id":"TWs0Z9","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"3 Bogatyrska Street","locality":"Kyiv","postalCode":"04655","phone":"+38(044) 412-84-10","website":"http:\/\/obolon.ua\/","isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"UA","yearOpened":"1980","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:04","updateDate":"2015-06-02 13:21:40","country":{"isoCode":"UA","name":"UKRAINE","displayName":"Ukraine","isoThree":"UKR","numberCode":804,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"BgtWqH","name":"Old Bust Head Root Beer","nameDisplay":"Old Bust Head Root Beer","styleId":139,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-04-22 15:09:37","updateDate":"2015-04-22 15:09:37","style":{"id":139,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Non-Alcoholic (Beer) Malt Beverages","shortName":"Non-Alcoholic","description":"Non-alcoholic (NA) malt beverages should emulate the character of a previously listed category\/subcategory designation but without the alcohol (less than 0.5 percent).

In 1886 Adam Schumacher bought the brewery and started brewing beer. In 1906, the Potosi Brewing Company was founded by Adam and his brothers Nicholas and Henry. At its peak, the Potosi Brewery had grown to be the fifth largest in Wisconsin, shipping a variety of labels including Good Old Potosi, Holiday, Garten Brau, Augsburger and others to destinations throughout the United States. In 1972 the brewery ceased operations and closed its doors.\r\n\r\nThe restoration of the Potosi Brewery began in 1995 when Gary David bought the ruined Potosi Brewery Bottling buildings. This nearly one square block of buildings had just suffered a major fire and most of the buildings were a total loss. After working three years to rebuild parts of what had been destroyed, Gary then turned his attention to the Brewery itself. Being awarded the high bid at the county auction he then enlisted the help of his friend Rick Tobin and cousin Denis David. It was the marketing genius of Denis and his wife Madonna in 1999 that brought the public on board through a community meeting. This meeting was overwhelmingly attended by the public and brought forth numerous suggestions as well as additional support. It was this gathering of the public that led to the formation of the Potosi Brewery Foundation in February of 2000.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, with restoration underway, the Potosi Brewery Foundation was selected by the American Breweriana Association to be the home to its national museum. According to Len Chylack, president of the American Breweriana Association, Potosi was selected over cities such as Milwaukee and St. Louis because of their passion for beer, brewery history and beer-making culture.","website":"http:\/\/www.potosibrewery.com\/","established":"1852","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_ZDaYgp-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_ZDaYgp-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_ZDaYgp-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_ZDaYgp-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Q4eTmd\/upload_ZDaYgp-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2016-06-24 17:44:52","locations":[{"id":"HeStKS","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"209 South Main Street","extendedAddress":"Box 177","locality":"Potosi","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"53820","phone":"608-763-4002","website":"http:\/\/www.potosibrewery.com\/","latitude":42.6716654,"longitude":-90.7271709,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1852","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"6CSqoU","name":"Pure Intentions Nitro Cold Brew Coffee","nameDisplay":"Pure Intentions Nitro Cold Brew Coffee","styleId":139,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-05-21 14:49:31","updateDate":"2016-05-21 14:49:31","style":{"id":139,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Non-Alcoholic (Beer) Malt Beverages","shortName":"Non-Alcoholic","description":"Non-alcoholic (NA) malt beverages should emulate the character of a previously listed category\/subcategory designation but without the alcohol (less than 0.5 percent).

For us, this is a passion, not a job. We believe that this comes through in the beers we make. Our beers have soul.\r\n\r\nWe brew several different beers; some are year round, some are seasonal and a few are single batch brews. They are available in bars, restaurants, grocery stores, liquor stores and warehouse stores throughout Texas and Louisiana.\r\n\r\nOur first keg of beer was shipped on June 9, 1994. Founded by Brock Wagner and Kevin Bartol, we chose Houston because, other than living here, this was the largest city in the country that did not have a microbrewery. Brock was a longtime homebrewer and had considered opening a brewery as far back as college, although that was quickly dismissed as a silly idea. Seven years after graduating, Brock revisited the idea, enlisted Kevin's help and the brewery was off and running. Kevin has since left the business after a bitter battle. (Just kidding - but don't you wish people wrote that when it was the truth?).\r\n\r\nPlease visit us if you are in Houston.

Legend has it, that the sweedish troops soon found out, that there was no single drop of beer in the barrels, while preparing the Johannisburg castle for the royal court.\r\n\r\nAs it happened, there was a foot soldier by the name of Joseph L\u00f6gler amongst this troops, who was proficient in brewing beer. The short form of Joseph is \u201cSepp\u201d or \u201cSeppel\u201d for \u201clittle Joseph\u201d. Obviously, by making beer the brave soldier Seppel was of much better use to the King of Sweden, because he was going lame due to an old battlefield injury to the leg. The injury was the cause for his nickname \u201cSchlappe-Seppel\u201d.\r\n\r\nThe beer of the brave soldier was very well received because of its excellence and very soon after the first brew, he had to make more beer. In the end, he stayed behind in Aschaffenburg, after the Swedish troops had left. He settled as a cooper and brewer.
