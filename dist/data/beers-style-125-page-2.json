Always looking to take a good thing too far, we sat down and over a beer (or two) decided that beer itself was a good idea. Of course, not just some easy-drinking institutional prole beer, but stuff like the beers we'd had at great bars. We had frequented places with extensive and varied beer lists. Places with lists 180 items long, all of which we tried twice (not in one night). In short, we wanted beer with flavor. Complexity. Character. Intensity. Not words found in the mass market lexicon.\r\n\r\nSo with a banjo burner, a bunch of industrial kitchen sized pots and as many buckets as we could find, we jumped in feet first. Once a week, every week. We tried to emulate the beers we liked, but soon we were adding a little of this, or some of that and after a while we started having a hard time pegging our beer in a style category. Our first success was a Porter that was mainly porter, slightly stout. We ran it blind with our friends against the porters we liked and people liked it. \"We're on to something\", we thought. Twenty iterations, modifications and tweaks later it is Distorter, and is still our favorite beer.\r\n\r\nThis led to twice a week brewing and handing out bottle after bottle to everyone we knew. Along the way we screwed up a wheat beer by accidentally making it into sort of a copper ale with a few too many hops. And so Red Bud Ale was born. We had some extra noble hops and threw them in the IPA, and with some tinkering we most certainly had a one-of-a-kind IPA. You get the picture. All of this has firmly cemented our \"anything goes\" approach to beer making. Our inability to ever get quite within the style guidelines means we may never win an award, but we're ok with that.\r\n\r\nNow, several years later and with a 90% super-cool\/10% Rube Goldberg 7 bbl version of our banjo burner and kitchen pots, we're befuddling the beer judges and converting the masses. One pint at a time.\r\n\r\nStop in the storefront and try our mainstays, seasonals and small-batch runs. Not to mention our lab beers, where we continue to screw up one thing or another in search of the next great beer.","website":"http:\/\/www.greenbushbrewing.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:19:53","locations":[{"id":"AlhRYb","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"5885 Sawyer Rd.","locality":"Sawyer","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49125","phone":"269-405-1076","website":"http:\/\/www.greenbushbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sunday - Thursday: 12-8\r\nFriday and Saturday: 12-10","latitude":41.8856286,"longitude":-86.5946671,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"As73p2","name":"Anniversary Ale","nameDisplay":"Anniversary Ale","description":"This special ale is a hybrid of styles: a dark beer, a Belgian beer and a session beer.

The brewing began in a small apartment kitchen on Pine St. in San Francisco on a stove that could hardly generate a boil. During the first night, it became apparent that we could create the beer that we wanted to drink and the collective that became Pine Street Brewery (PSB) was born. That was goal from the first night of brewing\u2014it was love at first smell.\r\n\r\nPSB moved into the historic Bourne Mansion in Pacific Heights during the Spring of 2010 and called this home until the Fall of 2011. Regular weekly brewing led to lots of experimentation and ten recipes that have become part of the core beer list. During \u201cBrew Nights,\u201d friends were made, a community was fostered and a brand was started.\r\n\r\nPine Street Brewery was designed so that our products would be available for many different palates in many different communities.

My family was no different. I grew up hearing stories that cascaded across a broad plain of topics, but the ones that fascinated me most centered around the Kingsbury Breweries.\r\n\r\nBack in 1926, the Kingsbury Breweries, then known as the Gutsch Brewery, declared bankruptcy. It was a tough time for breweries across the country as Prohibition was in full effect. Many breweries failed during that time, and the Gutsch Brewery was on its way to joining them. It was at this time that my family took the helm of the brewery. Soon after, they changed the name to the Kingsbury Breweries, expanded coast-to-coast, and turned the brewery into what we remember it as today.\r\n\r\nI grew up hearing stories from my father, who, as a child with his father, would go around the various Kingsbury Breweries, see the brewers hard at work, and watch the customers enjoy a beer in the Ratskellar. This is where my interest was first piqued by the great world of beer. Many years later, thanks to a brilliant gift on my wife\u2019s part, I started making my own beer. From that point forward there was no turning back. The hobby turned into a passion, which turned into an obsession, which turned into quitting my day job and opening a brewery.\r\n\r\nThis is my Really Cool Waterslide - my choice to take a dream and make it my reality. Thank you to all those who have helped me get here.\r\n\r\n- Grant Pauly, 3 Sheeps Brewing","website":"http:\/\/www.3sheepsbrewing.com","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Hw7H52\/upload_QJdBdz-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Hw7H52\/upload_QJdBdz-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Hw7H52\/upload_QJdBdz-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Hw7H52\/upload_QJdBdz-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Hw7H52\/upload_QJdBdz-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-03-08 20:04:30","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:28:29","locations":[{"id":"5R4Akp","name":"Main Location","streetAddress":"1327 Huron Ave","locality":"Sheboygan","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"53081","phone":"920-395-3583","website":"http:\/\/www.3sheepsbrewing.com\/","latitude":43.7593533,"longitude":-87.7225872,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-03-08 20:05:17","updateDate":"2015-12-03 19:09:17","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"MWD0tV","name":"Autumnus","nameDisplay":"Autumnus","abv":"7.4","glasswareId":3,"availableId":4,"styleId":125,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/MWD0tV\/upload_BPcKru-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/MWD0tV\/upload_BPcKru-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/MWD0tV\/upload_BPcKru-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","servingTemperature":"cold","servingTemperatureDisplay":"Cold - (4-7C\/39-45F)","createDate":"2012-11-01 11:07:22","updateDate":"2015-12-16 19:58:04","glass":{"id":3,"name":"Mug","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":125,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Specialty Beer","shortName":"Specialty","description":"These beers are brewed using unusual fermentable sugars, grains and starches that contribute to alcohol content other than, or in addition to, malted barley.

After ending up on the wrong side of the tracks a few times, they were finally pointed in the direction of Virginia-Highlands and found a few bars willing to take a chance on them. \"We'll give you a shot as long as your dog stops begging for leftovers on our patio\" was the cautious approval they needed to get the brand rolling.\r\n\r\nSweetWater's second and current location is in Midtown Atlanta, adjacent to Ansley Park, in the Armour Circle Industrial Park just off of Piedmont and Monroe. The boys saved all of their pennies to buy the 25,000 square feet of brewing goodness and smack in the middle of all the action. Since the company began we've wanted to be closer to our homes, the bars and stores that sell our beer, and all the good folks that drink it.

Produced in collaboration with our good friend and masterful sake home-brewer, Todd Bellomy, this has been one of the most interesting and labor-intensive beers ever to come out of CBC.\r\nWe began last December by spending many cold, windy days in the alley behind the brewery, steaming rice in small batches to brew what became almost fifty gallons of pure sake. Sake is produced by multiple parallel fermentation: polished rice is converted to sugar by a fungus called Koji (Aspergillus oryzae) and fermentation is taken care of by sake yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae kyokai). After several weeks of fermentation this batch of sake (possibly the largest batch of sake ever made in New England) was destined to become the starter for our beer.\r\nJust after Christmas, Todd joined us again to brew a mere six barrels of the craziest beer wort ever. Pale barley malt and flaked rice went into the mash, and after extracting only the first runnings we added a significant amount of brown rice syrup. This yielded a wort of 31*P\/1.124SG, or in other words, some really thick, sticky stuff! The wort was sent to the fermenter and then, with fingers crossed, we pumped over the entire batch of sake including the yeast, Koji, and lots of rice slurry. Fermentation was slow and low at 50*F for six weeks, followed by cold-conditioning until it reached more than 15%abv!\r\nIncredibly complex aromas and flavors abound, including sweet rice, fresh apples and grapes, hints of earth and mushroom from the koji, and as it warms further notes of fennel, herbs, and an almost Belgian-yeast spiciness. Brilliant copper-colored, it is full in body despite its very dry finish. This is one to be sipped, savored, and contemplated. Banryu Ichi is a truly unique beverage, served with intentionally very low carbonation in a 5oz. glass set inside a Masu, a traditional cedar sake cup.\r\nKampai!","abv":"15","glasswareId":5,"availableId":4,"styleId":125,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:45","updateDate":"2015-06-04 17:27:41","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":125,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Specialty Beer","shortName":"Specialty","description":"These beers are brewed using unusual fermentable sugars, grains and starches that contribute to alcohol content other than, or in addition to, malted barley.

A labor of love in which long brew days in the garage, bad equipment, curious dogs (we still blame them for a bad batch or two) and hanging out with friends became commonplace. Once it took root, this hobby turned into a passion (along with some really solid beers).\r\n\r\nWe took our wares to football games, parties, and cookouts. Before too long, folks began requesting our beer. It\u2019s pretty fun to have someone you don\u2019t even know walk right smack dab up to you and tell you how much they like your beer. We didn\u2019t set out to start a business, the business just found us. \r\n\r\n\u201cOnce in a while you get shown the light in the strangest of places if you look at it right\u201d Robert Hunter\r\n\r\nWe wanted to brew our beer and create something that would make our families, friends, community, and ourselves proud in what we were doing. We wanted to give back and help support those that helped support us.  We wanted to represent the unique qualities of the South that make us proud to be southerners. \r\n\r\nGood People Brewing Company seemed like the perfect fit.  Good People describes the kind, humble, concerned, and respected folks all throughout the South, no matter if your speaking singularly or plurally. That is what we strive for here at Good People Brewing Company\u2026.to be good people. \r\n\r\nIn September of 2007, we acquired our equipment and started getting our brewery put together. It was a long, frustrating, and tiring process\u2026.but it was flat worth every bit of it all.\r\n\r\nSo if you are looking for something made in small batches with high quality ingredients and pride, please give us a shot.\r\n\r\nThe Brewery\r\nWe brew on a two kettle, combi-tank and brew kettle, 20 bbl system manufactured by New World Systems.

Rogue's first brewpub was located in Ashland, Oregon and was a 10bbl brewsystem. Rogue opened a second brewpub, 15bbl brewsystem, in May 1989 located in Newport, Oregon. Rogue closed its Ashland operation in 1997, after the great flood destroyed the place. In 1991, the 15bbl system, named Howard after John Maier's former boss, from the Newport brewpub was transferred across the bay to the current brewery and upgraded to a 30bbl system. In 1998 Rogue bought a 50bbl brewsystem, named Kobe. Kobe is the only brewsystem in use. Tours: We offer brewery tours every day at 3 pm (followed by a distillery tour at 4pm). Go up to the bar inside the brewery (Brewers on the Bay) and check in with the bartender and the tour will commence. Please call ahead if you have a large group and or to verify the tour time...Brewer's on the Bay phone is 541-867-3664.
