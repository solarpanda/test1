Since then, the Central PA natives have been handcrafting world-class beers that blend traditional brewing techniques with the innovation and eclecticism of the American craft brewing movement. Today, the Hershey, PA-based brewery produces six year-round beers (Hopback Amber Ale, Troegenator Double Bock, JavaHead Stout, Tr\u00f6egs Pale Ale, DreamWeaver Wheat, and Perpetual IPA); four seasonal releases as part of the Hop Cycle series (Cultivator Helles Bock, Sunshine Pils, Hop Knife Harvest Ale, and Blizzard of Hops Winter IPA); and two limited beers (Nugget Nectar and Mad Elf Ale). \r\n\r\nIn addition to these beers, Tr\u00f6egs produces a variety of experimental, small batch beers as part of its Scratch Beer Series. These beers are available exclusively at the brewery and most are draft-only limited releases, although some popular Scratch Beers (Fresh Hop Ale, Fest Lager, etc.) are bottled for release through the General Store at the brewery. \r\n\r\nIn late 2013, Tr\u00f6egs introduced a special line of cork & cage bottle releases. The first, LaGrave, is available year-round. Master of Pumpkins was also released in 2013 and will continue with availability in the fall. Other beers such as Jovial have since followed suit. The addition of a canning line not only offers the brewery more flexibility in the way it presents its beers, but also allows Tr\u00f6egs to provide customers with more packaging options. To date, Tr\u00f6egs has released Perpetual IPA and Sunshine Pils in 12-ounce cans and Troegenator in 16-ounce cans. Plans to release other seasonal and limited beers in cans are currently in the works. \r\n\r\nThe Splinter Series is an extremely limited line of barrel-aged beers packaged in cork & cage bottles. While only a handful of these beers have been produced, Tr\u00f6egs plans to expand this series with the inclusion of Nebulous (barrel-aged LaGrave with Brett), bourbon barrel-aged Troegenator, and others. \r\n\r\nTr\u00f6egs currently distributes its beers throughout Delaware, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Washington D.C. In addition, Tr\u00f6egs plans to expand into other New England markets in 2015.\r\n\r\nOur state-of-the-art facility gives visitors a glimpse into the workings of a full production brewery by offering both guided tasting and self-guided tours. Our Tasting Room provides ample seating with views of the brewhouse, where you can sit back and enjoy one of our six year-round beers as well as a variety of seasonal and small-batch experimental brews. \r\n\r\nOur Snack Bar reflects our constant desire to explore, discover and share by focusing on fresh, simple fare that is locally sourced and house-made. With that in mind, we feature a seasonally rotating menu with daily chef\u2019s specials.\r\n\r\nwww.troegs.com","website":"http:\/\/www.troegs.com\/","established":"1997","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/www.troegs.com\/about_us\/newsletter.aspx","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_d9lSk3-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_d9lSk3-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_d9lSk3-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_d9lSk3-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/n5QFi2\/upload_d9lSk3-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:01:05","locations":[{"id":"C6iHOv","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"200 E Hersheypark Dr","locality":"Hershey","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"17033","phone":"717-232-1297","website":"http:\/\/www.troegs.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sun:  11:00am - 9:00pm\nThu:  11:00am - 10:00pm\nFri:  11:00am - 10:00pm\nSat:  11:00am - 10:00pm\n\nGeneral Store Hours\r\n------------------------------\r\nSunday: 11am to 5pm\r\nMonday - Saturday: 11am to 8pm","latitude":40.2972852,"longitude":-76.6428527,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1997","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2015-04-24 16:00:33","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"7ANG9D","name":"Sea Witch Milk Stout","nameDisplay":"Sea Witch Milk Stout","description":"Conjured up and brewed with 8 varieties of malted barley, this stout is full-bodied with hints of chocolate and dark roasted coffee.

Sara had just finished her fifth season of guiding whitewater rafting trips and Jordan had recently passed the Colorado Bar exam. People scoffed. However, for Sara and Jordan the next logical step was to open up a cool wing joint where people could drink cold beer, eat spicy wings, listen to some good music and kick it with their homies. They wanted to open their wing joint in a town that needed great wings and that suited their outdoorsy lifestyles.\r\nAfter some research it became clear that Portland was the ideal place. After moving to Oregon in the fall of 2003, Sara and Jordan scoped out the town, worked hard in local restaurants, and developed their menu for their new restaurant. Neither of them had ever managed a restaurant, let alone owned one. They attended small business meetings, talked to accountants, restaurant owners and local wing connoisseurs. People asked them if Portland was ready for a wing joint. Others suggested they should have stuck with their previous occupations. The naysayers fueled Sara and Jordan's passion for opening their restaurant even more.\r\nOn the first day of 2005, the first customers walked through the doors of Fire on the Mountain Buffalo Wings. In the early days, there were just a couple cooks and Sara and Jordan were the only front of house staff. Fast forward to 2011 where Fire on the Mountain Buffalo Wings has become a Portland institution with three restaurants and close to 100 employees. FOTM still possesses the same passion to provide customers with a fun, easygoing restaurant to enjoy our delicious food and great service.","website":"http:\/\/www.portlandwings.com\/index.php","established":"2005","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-05-20 23:32:06","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:09:12","locations":[{"id":"zXqAje","name":"Burnside","streetAddress":"1708 E.
