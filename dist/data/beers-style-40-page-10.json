The brettanomyces yeast imparts robust fruit flavors and aromas, and combines with Motueka and Topaz hops to create uncommon tastes and aromas.\r\n\r\nWild at Heart pours a rich amber hue, slightly hazy with a full white head. Tropical aromas include mango, passion fruit, pineapple, and a touch of slight lemon and lime. Complex flavors present a restrained fruity sweetness, green apples and a touch of tartness. Carefully balanced with gentle malt sweetness and moderate lemon and lime hop flavor.
