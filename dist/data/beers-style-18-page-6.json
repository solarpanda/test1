A microbrewery was in the original plans for the business but was not feasible at the time due to the high cost of equipment and space.  The Wildflower Caf\u00e9 had enormous success, which helped the inspiration for the Crooked Rooster Brewpub\u2019s opening in 1998, again founded by Doug Thayer.  Throughout the running of these side-by-side businesses, Doug always had brewing on his mind and began to experiment in 2002 with home brewing.  Receiving excellent feedback on his brews from several beer aficionados, Roosterfish Brewing\u2019s first official beer, Black Walnut Nut Brown Ale (now known as Original Nut Brown Ale) was unveiled at the Crooked Rooster and Wildflower Caf\u00e9 in 2004.  This was shortly followed with the Butternut Pale Ale, now known as Dog Tooth Pale Ale.  The drastic name changes occurred because the originals were rejected due to \u201cimplied ingredients\u201d that weren\u2019t actually present in the beers.","website":"http:\/\/www.roosterfishbrewing.com\/","established":"1990","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/WQyasy\/upload_ELX0K7-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/WQyasy\/upload_ELX0K7-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/WQyasy\/upload_ELX0K7-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/WQyasy\/upload_ELX0K7-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/WQyasy\/upload_ELX0K7-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:05:39","locations":[{"id":"TxaTZN","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"223 - 301 North Franklin Street","locality":"Watkins Glen","region":"New York","postalCode":"14891","phone":"607-535-9797","website":"http:\/\/www.roosterfishbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Sun: 11:30 am - 12:30 am","latitude":42.381121,"longitude":-76.874257,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1990","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"yS64Yy","name":"Main Brewery","region":"Th\u00fcringen","latitude":50.9307183,"longitude":12.0076316,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2012-08-12 14:45:22","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"0XL376","name":"Cocoa Porter","nameDisplay":"Cocoa Porter","description":"Classic, medium-bodied porter with cocoa nibs and a hint of smoked pepper.","styleId":18,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-04-10 18:05:24","updateDate":"2015-04-10 18:05:24","style":{"id":18,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Brown Porter","shortName":"Brown Porter","description":"Brown porters are mid to dark brown (may have red tint) in color.

He spent years perfecting his recipes and letting the community decide what beers they wanted from their local brewery. He fearlessly concocted hundreds of different beers to see what new flavors he might come up with. Not all were a hit, but that is how you find a gem. Do you have an idea for a beer you\u2019d like to try? Let him know, he just might try it out.\r\n \r\n903 Brewers officially opened its doors in June of 2013 and introduced to the world The Chosen One Coconut Ale and Roo\u2019s Red Ale. Since that time they have released many new and exciting beers. Starting fall of 2014 you will be able to find their beers in 22oz bombers.","website":"http:\/\/903brewers.com\/","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/y2ZQbD\/upload_8jDik1-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/y2ZQbD\/upload_8jDik1-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/y2ZQbD\/upload_8jDik1-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/y2ZQbD\/upload_8jDik1-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/y2ZQbD\/upload_8jDik1-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-05 17:48:26","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:46:13","locations":[{"id":"q7dLm5","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1718 S Elm St","locality":"Sherman","region":"Texas","postalCode":"75090","phone":"214.243.8090","latitude":33.6171881,"longitude":-96.607032,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-05 20:13:38","updateDate":"2015-12-03 19:03:30","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"3fXpki","name":"Coffee Porter","nameDisplay":"Coffee Porter","abv":"4.3","styleId":18,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-07-30 00:17:57","updateDate":"2013-07-30 00:17:58","style":{"id":18,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Brown Porter","shortName":"Brown Porter","description":"Brown porters are mid to dark brown (may have red tint) in color.
