They spent many long nights building brewing equipment by hand and coming up with tasty recipes.  More than twenty years later, the long nights and quest for great beer has continued, but on a much larger scale.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 2000, Cascade Lakes Brewing Company was purchased by Rick Orazetti and Doug Kutella.  Ron Kutella and Chris Justema soon joined the partnership. What started as a small brewing facility in an airport industrial zone has turned into a state-of-the-art, 25-barrel brew house system that allows brewing 775 gallons per batch, three times daily. The partners also expanded from just a brewery to having four local pubs: 7th Street Brew House, Tumalo Tavern, Cascade West Grub and Alehouse, and our flagship restaurant in Bend, Cascade Lakes Lodge. Cascade Lakes beer is now distributed and sold in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho.\r\n\r\nCascade Lakes brews six beers year-round: Blonde Bombshell, 20\u201d Brown, Paddleboard Porter, Hopsmack IPA, Mosaic IPA, and Cyclops IPA. They brew many seasonals throughout the year including: Snow Park XPA, Slippery Slope, Skookum Creek Ale, Paulina Lake Pilsner, Waste Deep Weiss, Riverside Red, Silverback Imperial Stout, Kolsch, IRA, etc. Look for our beers on draft at your favorite pub and grab a six-pack at your local grocery store.\r\n\r\nPHIL BREY \u2013 HEAD BREWER\r\nPhil brings 25 years of winemaking and brewing experience to Cascade Lakes Brewing Co. Phil started home brewing in college while working on his degree in Enology (winemaking) at Fresno State. Phil started with some winemaking stints in California at Mirassou Winery and Bogle Vineyards before moving to Bend. He began his professional brewing career at Deschutes Brewery. After some time over in the valley making wine at Benton-Lane Winery and Spindrift Cellars, and brewing at Oregon Trail Brewery, Phil returned to the High Desert to brew at Cascade Lakes, where he has worked since 2010. When Phil isn\u2019t producing some sort of alcohol, he can be found mountain biking, hiking, gardening and spending time with family.","website":"http:\/\/cascadelakes.com\/","established":"1994","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/sIBGId\/upload_2VG3hV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/sIBGId\/upload_2VG3hV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/sIBGId\/upload_2VG3hV-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/sIBGId\/upload_2VG3hV-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/sIBGId\/upload_2VG3hV-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:50","updateDate":"2016-06-23 18:22:00","locations":[{"id":"O2ScDy","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2141 SW First Street","locality":"Redmond","region":"Oregon","postalCode":"97756","phone":"541-923-3110","website":"http:\/\/cascadelakes.com\/","latitude":44.256031,"longitude":-121.169251,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1994","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:50","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"C7u6RO","name":"7th Street Brew House","streetAddress":"855 SW 7th Street","locality":"Redmond","region":"Oregon","postalCode":"97756","phone":"541-923-1795","website":"http:\/\/cascadelakes.com\/pubs\/7th-street\/","hoursOfOperation":"Open Sunday \u2013 Thursday 11:30 am \u2013 10:00 pm\r\nFriday- Saturday 11:30 am \u2013 11:00 am","latitude":44.2687763,"longitude":-121.1757063,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"restaurant","locationTypeDisplay":"Restaurant\/Ale House","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-10-23 14:05:35","updateDate":"2016-07-03 15:46:44","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"oRcuap","name":"Cascade Lakes Lodge","streetAddress":"1441 SW Chandler Ave Suite 100","locality":"Bend","region":"Oregon","postalCode":"97702","phone":"541-388-4998","website":"http:\/\/www.cascadelakes.com\/pubs\/lodge\/","hoursOfOperation":"Open 11:30 am -10:00 pm seven days a week.","latitude":44.0414862,"longitude":-121.3329318,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"restaurant","locationTypeDisplay":"Restaurant\/Ale House","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2004","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-10-23 14:06:49","updateDate":"2016-06-24 12:35:50","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"QlLikG","name":"Tumalo Tavern","streetAddress":"64670 Stricker #103","locality":"Bend","region":"Oregon","postalCode":"97701","phone":"541.330.2323","website":"http:\/\/www.cascadelakes.com\/pubs\/tumalo-tavern\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  11:00am -

For Ken Landin and Janine Bennett the answer to that question would always be \"listening to live music and drinking craft beer.\" Fueled by their outrage over the political and corporate disaster that unfolded on the nightly news, and frustrated by the thought that their lifestyle may contribute to the problem, they were at a crossroads. And so began the plan for Crossroads Brewing Company.\r\n \r\nThere was many years of discussion, research, paperwork, rejection, and searching for the perfect property.  After having deals fall through and the economy taking a turn for the worse, their hopes were fading. Then, in December of 2008, the Brooks Opera House in Historic Athens was discovered by accident. After leaving a restaurant just 2 miles from home they noticed a for sale sign on the deteriorating building and it's just like the old saying goes............when you know, you know.\r\n \r\nIt was quickly realized that when a community believes in what you are doing and puts it's support behind you, great things can happen. So they were off and running from the first turn of the key. Restoring a Historic Opera House from 1893 was not part of the original plan but with hard work and their secret weapon, Janine's brother Jimmy, things are coming together. Ken, Janine, Jimmy and Janine's Dad, Jim, have had their hands on just about every square inch of this 15,000 square foot building. Little by little, this grand and unique property will be restored to it's former glory.\r\n  \r\nEveryday seems to bring a new challenge but the ultimate goal remains clear. This building was once the hub of this sleepy riverside village and Ken and Janine intend to return it to the community. The second floor, where the Opera House once was, will get a new stage for plays and musical performances of all kinds. Athens is surrounded by hard working farmers so looking any further for meats and produce just doesn't make sense.  From organic menu items to earth friendly building materials the environment is a factor in every decision that is made along the way.

In accordance with the Reinheitsgebot (German Purity Law of 1516), bock beers must have a pre-fermentation malt sugar concentration of 16%, which converts over to at least 7% alcohol after fermentation. These strong beers were made popular in the early 1600s by monks in order to minimize their hunger during fasting periods. While most bocks are dark, Blonde Bock is golden-colored and malty with a rich, creamy head. The rich flavor is counterbalanced with just the right level of bitterness from the Hallertau aroma hops and create a very smooth profile.","abv":"7","ibu":"23","glasswareId":5,"availableId":1,"styleId":88,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/8eyXN7\/upload_MgCPJk-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/8eyXN7\/upload_MgCPJk-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/8eyXN7\/upload_MgCPJk-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:52","updateDate":"2015-12-15 20:57:18","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":88,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Traditional German-Style Bock","shortName":"Bock","description":"Traditional bocks are made with all malt and are strong, malty, medium- to full-bodied, bottom-fermented beers with moderate hop bitterness that should increase proportionately with the starting gravity.

It is located in the city of Drammen, approximately 25 miles south of our capital, Oslo. You will spot it at the banks of the Drammen River at the very same place as it has been since 1834. The annual production of beer is aprox. 10 mill liter (85 000 barrels), and together with the production of 18 mill liters of soft drinks and mineralwater it gives employment to approximately 150 people.  You may wonder how we got our name ? It was a young fellow with the name Poul Lauritz Aass that bought the brewery in 1860. Since then it has been in the same family, and is today run by the 4th generation of Aass. (By the way - A real Norwegian viking would pronounce it Ouse)  The brewery is proud of its history. To us the quality of what we produce has always been and always will be the main issue. In 1516, Duke Wilhelm of Bavaria established a law admitting only malted barley, hops yeast, and water as ingredients in the production of beer. The law is known as the purity law and Aass Brewery is still loyal to Duke Wilhelm of Bavaria. In Norway the brewery is known for outstanding quality and large number of different beer types.","website":"http:\/\/www.aass.no","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TGtEbk\/upload_rooKoF-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TGtEbk\/upload_rooKoF-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TGtEbk\/upload_rooKoF-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TGtEbk\/upload_rooKoF-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TGtEbk\/upload_rooKoF-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:43","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:38:13","locations":[{"id":"gaVq6l","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Ole Steensgt. 10 Postboks 1530","locality":"Drammen","phone":"47-32-26-60-00","website":"http:\/\/www.aass.no","latitude":59.7440738,"longitude":10.2044564,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"NO","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:43","updateDate":"2015-11-20 18:30:48","country":{"isoCode":"NO","name":"NORWAY","displayName":"Norway","isoThree":"NOR","numberCode":578,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"wzPwLu","name":"Bock","nameDisplay":"Bock","description":"A dark German lager with hints of caramel, biscuit and expresso.
