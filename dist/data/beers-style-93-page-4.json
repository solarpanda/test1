It didn't take long before the act, the ideas, and the processes of brewing began to take over our lives. Shortly thereafter we dubbed ourselves Black Pond Brews, after a pond where we had some fun and memorable times in Woodstock, CT. Within no time we were entering our beers into homebrew competitions and they were met with immediate success. Spurred by this success and by the constant clamoring of our friends and family to make more beer, we really began to ask ourselves: how do we turn this passion for producing beer into a commercial reality?\r\n \r\nOur project is not only valuable to us, but to the community in which we will operate.  Our beautiful, quiet town of Danielson, CT will become a destination for anyone who loves beer, be they local or travellers.  Who doesn't love beer?  Further, who doesn't love MORE beer to try?!\r\n \r\nWhat inspires us?\r\nThe ability to write or create something unique, something revolutionary. Clara Barton once said \u201cI defy the tyranny of precedent. I go for anything new that might improve the past\". Such a philosophy is inherent in the way we approach brewing. Breweries often spend much of their time and effort looking back to past recipes- often times as far back as the inception of brewing itself- but what of the future? What new ideas and flavors can we explore? We are always pushing the envelope against the grain- but our guiding star will always be uncompromising flavor of the highest quality.","website":"http:\/\/www.blackpondbrews.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/RBaOzm\/upload_V4dCw0-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/RBaOzm\/upload_V4dCw0-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/RBaOzm\/upload_V4dCw0-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/RBaOzm\/upload_V4dCw0-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/RBaOzm\/upload_V4dCw0-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-05-17 11:34:47","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:09:03","locations":[{"id":"t8ecnf","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"21A Furnace St","locality":"Danielson","region":"Connecticut","postalCode":"06239","phone":"860-207-5295","website":"BlackPondBrews.com","hoursOfOperation":"Thu:  5:00pm - 8:00pm\nFri:  5:00pm - 8:00pm\nSat:  3:00pm - 8:00pm\nSun:  12:00pm - 5:00pm\n\nWe are located in the basement of the beautiful Danielson Adventure Sports Building.","latitude":41.804121,"longitude":-71.883942,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"nano","locationTypeDisplay":"Nano Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-05-17 11:34:47","updateDate":"2015-05-18 14:49:59","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"PWE92R","name":"Curious Brew","nameDisplay":"Curious Brew","description":"A premium lager brewed in England and re-fermented with Champagne yeast for a curiously distinctive, clean and refreshing lager beer.

The brewery is named for the famed Clipper ship - first developed and built in the home port of Baltimore. While the name of the company remains Clipper City Brewing Company, all of its beer falls under the Heavy Seas brand. Heavy Seas is located at 4615 Hollins Ferry Road, Suite B, in the Halethorpe section of Baltimore. Heavy Seas currently offers a variety of beer styles in approx. 18 states within the United States.\r\n\r\nHeavy Seas mission is to bring back the local brewery, and to do it in such a way that we are more than just a fringe player, but a positive part of our area. To accomplish this mission we have created a broad portfolio of products with enough diversity that we have at least one beer that can appeal to everyone. Whether your preference is for a classic American style lager beer, or a big, challenging Hop Cubed Ale, we have a something that will suit your taste. We believe in bringing beer drinkers the quality and flavor of a handcrafted beer while supporting the local communities we serve.","website":"http:\/\/www.hsbeer.com\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wTFQaf\/upload_DPoml0-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wTFQaf\/upload_DPoml0-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wTFQaf\/upload_DPoml0-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wTFQaf\/upload_DPoml0-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wTFQaf\/upload_DPoml0-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:43:22","locations":[{"id":"yX6twV","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"4615-B Hollins Ferry Road","locality":"Baltimore","region":"Maryland","postalCode":"21227","phone":"410-247-7822","website":"http:\/\/www.hsbeer.com\/","latitude":39.230827,"longitude":-76.6751309,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2014-11-20 13:52:46","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"vh3ZUn","name":"Heavy Seas Alehouse - Baltimore","streetAddress":"1300 Bank Street","locality":"Baltimore","region":"Maryland","postalCode":"21231","phone":"(410) 753-1403","website":"http:\/\/heavyseasalehouse.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  4:00pm - 12:00am\nTue:  4:00pm - 12:00am\nWed:  4:00pm - 12:00am\nThu:  4:00pm - 12:00am\nFri:  12:00pm - 2:00am\nSat:  12:00pm - 2:00am\nSun:  11:00am - 12:00am\n\n","latitude":39.286626,"longitude":-76.598808,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"restaurant","locationTypeDisplay":"Restaurant\/Ale House","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-05-23 22:13:06","updateDate":"2014-11-20 13:51:07","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"gmfbj6","name":"Heavy Seas Alehouse - Arlington","streetAddress":"1501 Wilson Blvd","locality":"Arlington","region":"Virginia","postalCode":"22209","phone":"(703) 879-4388","website":"http:\/\/heavyseasalehouse.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  11:00am - 12:00am\nTue:  11:00am - 12:00am\nWed:  11:00am - 12:00am\nThu:  11:00am - 12:00am\nFri:  11:00am - 2:00am\nSat:  11:00am - 2:00am\nSun:  11:00am - 12:00am\n\n","latitude":38.8952016,"longitude":-77.0742466,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"restaurant","locationTypeDisplay":"Restaurant\/Ale House","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-11-20 13:52:30","updateDate":"2014-11-20 13:52:46","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"az7tzz","name":"De Soto Lager","nameDisplay":"De Soto Lager","description":"This Mexican style lager is light and crisp!

But if we dig a bit deeper, it also becomes obvious that we are a lager drinking nation. For as long as anyone can remember, we\u2019ve been been up to our collective noses in it. The problem is that most of it has been produced as an exercise in profit and not flavour. Big beer has drifted far from the origins of this traditional style.\r\nLagering actually dates as far back as medieval times, where brewers would barrel ferment in the cooler temperatures of caves, but the advent of refrigeration in the late 19th century helped to perpetuate it to new levels of popularity. Consistently cool temperatures, along with a bottom fermenting yeast, yielded a clear, clean and long-lasting beer which now helps define the style. A style we feel is not being faithfully represented by what\u2019s commercially available . . . until now.\r\nDevil\u2019s Peak Brewing Company\u2019s Lager has been created as an ode to the traditional lagers of Germany. Brewed with the famous noble Hallertauer Mittelfr\u00fch, we have looked to the past to bring you the future of beer in South Africa. Made with 100% malt, we do not add sugar or adjuncts to cut corners and save cost.

We've worked hard and are incredibly proud of the many successes we've enjoyed over the years. The Boston Beer Company has been cited as one of the best companies to work for by Boston Magazine, one of the Best Entry-Level Jobs by The Princeton Review, and our beers have won more awards than any other in history. Jim has been named an \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" by Inc. Magazine. Our brewers keep amazing us with innovative new brews, including Samuel Adams Utopias and our Samuel Adams Barrel Room Collection.\r\n\r\nJim has believed from the beginning that the more you know and understand about beer, the more you'll appreciate a beer like Samuel Adams Boston Lager. To begin that mission, all new employees go through intensive training on everything from ingredients, brewing, and beer styles, to taking care of the beer once it leaves the brewery. We're all beer lovers and protectors of the beer so we're trained how to identify off flavors and how to troubleshoot the causes. The passion for beer continues with an annual homebrew competition that we all take part in.\r\n\r\nOne of our wholesalers once asked Jim why he invested so much in training his people, when ultimately they might leave. Jim smiled and replied without hesitation: \"What if I didn't train them, and they stayed?\"\r\n\r\nEach year, usually in January, everyone gathers together. One of the highlights of the meeting is the beer trivia contest. With a culture so steeped in beer education and knowledge, winning is a pretty big deal. Recently, one of the hotel bartenders who was watching as the various teams arrived in costume with music and much enthusiasm and fanfare, said, \"I've always known Samuel Adams made the best beer in America, but now I see this is the greatest company in America.\" When you look around you see that The Boston Beer Company is a team of enthusiastic people who are passionate about beer and who really love coming to work every day to provide American drinkers with the best beer possible.\r\n\r\nThe Boston Beer Company, Inc. is a publicly-traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol, SAM.","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","established":"1984","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:24:45","locations":[{"id":"DF5YsC","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"30 Germania Street","locality":"Boston","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"02130","phone":"1-800-372-1131","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","latitude":42.314449,"longitude":-71.103365,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1984","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2015-12-02 19:22:03","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"MLUbXI","name":"Cincinnati","streetAddress":"1625 Central Parkway","locality":"Cincinnati","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45214","phone":"513-412-3200","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","latitude":39.1144986,"longitude":-84.5222061,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-12 13:10:57","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"XZ6L8a","name":"Production Brewery","streetAddress":"7880 Penn Drive","locality":"Breinigsville","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"18031","latitude":40.5759622,"longitude":-75.6290377,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2007","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-11-30 20:24:56","updateDate":"2015-12-02 19:22:03","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"eImPyB","name":"Dream Machine","nameDisplay":"Dream Machine","description":"Dream Machine, an India Pale Lager or IPL, is a melding of varied visions of an India Pale Ale and an Amber Lager.

In search of a calmer life and an even better beer, Jeff turned his passion for brewing into a career. After a temporary stint at Northern Brewer and a job as an assistant brewer at Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery, Flat Earth opened in Saint Paul and set out to create beers not normally found in the upper Midwest. Flat Earth's distinctive brews are often inspired by the couple's travels and time spent in conversation with family and friends. The company's brewing on the edge philosophy is reflected in its stylish interpretation of traditional brewing assumptions. Today, Flat Earth Brewing produces a variety of artisan ales and lagers every month. As the beers roll out of the brewery, you're sure to see a theme develop around their names  a hint of conspiracy, perhaps. The names are meant to get people thinking and talking. Whether you enjoy Flat Earth beers at home or out with friends, there are no secrets when it comes to good beer.","website":"http:\/\/flatearthbrewing.com\/","established":"2007","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/AulWoF\/upload_iM4ovC-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/AulWoF\/upload_iM4ovC-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/AulWoF\/upload_iM4ovC-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/AulWoF\/upload_iM4ovC-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/AulWoF\/upload_iM4ovC-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:45:56","locations":[{"id":"6gpvgZ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2035 Benson Avenue","locality":"St. Paul","region":"Minnesota","postalCode":"55116","website":"http:\/\/flatearthbrewing.com\/","latitude":44.9084187,"longitude":-93.1538067,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"LNr16q","name":"Hamm's Building","streetAddress":"688 Minnehaha Avenue East","locality":"Saint Paul","region":"Minnesota","postalCode":"55106","phone":"(651) 698-1945","website":"http:\/\/www.flatearthbrewing.com","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Sat: 12:00 pm - 6:30 pm","latitude":44.9629992,"longitude":-93.0716823,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-05-23 13:42:34","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"qipybT","name":"Esser's Best Original","nameDisplay":"Esser's Best Original","description":"A medium bodied old world German-style lager brewed with a variety of special caramel malts producing a deep amber color, with a full flavor and exceptional finish.","glasswareId":5,"availableId":1,"styleId":93,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/qipybT\/upload_3FnbAv-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/qipybT\/upload_3FnbAv-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/qipybT\/upload_3FnbAv-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-04-13 18:30:40","updateDate":"2015-12-16 16:46:46","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":93,"categoryId":8,"category":{"id":8,"name":"North American Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"American-Style Lager","shortName":"American Lager","description":"Light in body and very light to straw in color, American lagers are very clean and crisp and aggressively carbonated.

Esser started producing lager in a small brewery he bought in Monroe for $1,500. In 1863, he purchased 2 1\/2 acres of land in Cross Plains. The original building had two cellars below and several rooms above to house Esser's family. The beer, known as Esser's Best, was first brewed in October, 1863. He was joined in this enterprise in 1881 by his son Jacob. At that time, the brewery had a capacity of 2,000 barrels. A barrel of beer cost $7, and a case containing 36 pint bottles was priced at $1.75. Jacob and his sons, primarily Werner (W.B.) and Peter (Spundt) began delivering beer to the surrounding communities, often starting out as early as 3 a.m. Werner acted as Brew master from 1907 to 1910. It was increased competition from the larger breweries that forced him to become a distributor. The first beer that he handled as a distributor was Hausmann's originally brewed in Madison in 1920, Werner became the distributor for Blatz Near Beer. Following Prohibition in 1933, the company again to distribute beer. It should be noted that during prohibition, Werner and his brothers were kept very busy taking care of the beer needs in the area, mostly doing business at night. In 1937, Werner's eldest son, Roman, became a partner. At this point, the company began to handle Old Style products out of La Crosse, Wisconsin. The family tradition continued when Del Esser, Werner's youngest son, joined the firm in 1948. In 1988, Roman's son, Wayne, took over the business. In 1990, Wayne was joined in the business by his son, Larry, which made six generations of Essers in the bee business. It should also be noted that the Essers were distributors of Blatz and Old Style products until they sold the distributorship in January 1998 to Frank Beer in Middleton, Wisconsin. Frank beer is currently the distributor of Esser's Best in the area.","website":"http:\/\/www.essersbest.com\/","established":"1852","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/xHovlT\/upload_5NhCHF-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/xHovlT\/upload_5NhCHF-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/xHovlT\/upload_5NhCHF-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/xHovlT\/upload_5NhCHF-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/xHovlT\/upload_5NhCHF-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:43:58","locations":[{"id":"MWi5Kp","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2109 Hickory Street","locality":"Cross Plains","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"53528","phone":"1-608-798-3911","latitude":43.114731,"longitude":-89.653129,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"wYDgay","name":"Estrella Damm Lager","nameDisplay":"Estrella Damm Lager","abv":"5.4","styleId":93,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-06-16 15:34:08","updateDate":"2015-01-07 13:23:50","style":{"id":93,"categoryId":8,"category":{"id":8,"name":"North American Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"American-Style Lager","shortName":"American Lager","description":"Light in body and very light to straw in color, American lagers are very clean and crisp and aggressively carbonated.

Currently, the brewery resides in a 40,000 square foot facility 30 miles west of Chicago. In addition to their traditional style beers, Two Brothers Brewing Company produces many specialty beers including the Project Opus Sour series. Adjacent to the brewery, Two Brothers Tap House opened in 2008 as a restaurant which serves elevated, seasonal, and organic American pub fare.

The first beers brewed by the brothers were designed to be a departure from the fairly bleak craft brewing scene in the region. Nick and Simon brewed intense balanced beers that were and still remain \u201cnot normal\u201d by conventional standards.\r\n\r\nIn November of 2005, after receiving numerous visitors to the brewery over the years, Three Floyds opened its own brewpub at the production facility. What was once office space is now a refuge for the craft beer enthusiast. With all the Three Floyds mainstays, seasonal offerings, special small batch beers and many guest beers it is a mecca for craft beer. The pub also has a full service kitchen providing pub fare of the best quality supported by a 3000 square foot organic herb and vegetable garden.","website":"http:\/\/www.3floyds.com","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/iodDki\/upload_Va4zor-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/iodDki\/upload_Va4zor-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/iodDki\/upload_Va4zor-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/iodDki\/upload_Va4zor-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/iodDki\/upload_Va4zor-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2016-07-29 12:02:44","locations":[{"id":"71LkGn","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"9750 Indiana Parkway","locality":"Munster","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"46321","phone":"1-219-922-3565","website":"http:\/\/www.threefloydspub.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nTue:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nWed:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nThu:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nFri:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nSat:  12:00pm - 2:00am\r\nSun:  12:00pm - 12:00am","latitude":41.535541,"longitude":-87.516686,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2015-06-18 14:42:36","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"GoDmMT","name":"Munster","streetAddress":"9750 Indiana Parkway","locality":"Munster","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"46321","phone":"219-922-4425","website":"http:\/\/www.3floyds.com\/","latitude":41.535536,"longitude":-87.516687,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:16","updateDate":"2015-04-01 18:55:51","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"ckeF06","name":"Far Side","nameDisplay":"Far Side","description":"A lager brewed using all Munich malt imported from Germany.

Our brewing process utilizes the traditional English method of upward infusion mashing in our combination mash lauter tun to create lagers and ales inspired by old world values, but with modern quality and consistency. The staff at The Lion Brewery is dedicated to producing true handcrafted beers, made right here in our century-old Brewhouse. All of our premium beers are made using only the four basic ingredients allowed by the Reinheitsgebot, or German purity law. Under the skillful supervision of our Master Brewer, Leo Orlandini, each of our lagers and ales are brewed in small batches using only the finest hops and malts available to guarantee the highest quality and freshness. Each product we brew is an original recipe especially created to deliver a fuller flavor than ordinary beers, yet with an approachable style and character. As a result, our beers have garnered numerous medals from the Great American Beer Festival and the World Beer Championships in recent years.\r\n\r\nIn 1974 the Lion Brewing Company bought the Stegmaier Brand.","website":"http:\/\/www.lionbrewery.com\/","established":"1857","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TwOeWu\/upload_VQOP01-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TwOeWu\/upload_VQOP01-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TwOeWu\/upload_VQOP01-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TwOeWu\/upload_VQOP01-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TwOeWu\/upload_VQOP01-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:00","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:50:50","locations":[{"id":"z0gnmN","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"700 North Pennsylvania Blvd.","locality":"Wilkes Barre","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"18705","phone":"800-233-8327","website":"http:\/\/www.lionbrewery.com\/","latitude":41.2556575,"longitude":-75.858261,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1857","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:00","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"p7LIMQ","name":"FIX Hellas","nameDisplay":"FIX Hellas","description":"The Fix Hellas is a premium lager ideal choice for any time of imeras.I gentle flavor, with balanced bitterness, showcases the pleasant aromas created during the fermentation of yeast, leaving a rounded aftertaste long term.
