It would take 21 years for that initial interest to manifest itself into something drinkable. The spark would come after 9\/11 while he drank homebrewed stout with five of his friends. Motivated by patriotic feelings and the American dream of creating a business, the energy was set in motion to start Twin Lakes Brewing Company. Weeks later, Sam and his longtime friends Matt Day, Jack Wick, and Mark Fesche developed a unique 15 gallon gravity fed pilot system and began working to create their first signature brews.\r\n\r\nThey decided to locate the brewery at the beautiful \u201cTwin Lakes Farm\u201d in Greenville, Delaware. This historic 252 acre farm has been in Sam\u2019s family for seven generations and has a deep rock well aquifer which supplies perfect water for brewing. Local artisans converted an old tractor barn and art studio to accommodate a five vessel, gravity fed brewery and tasting room. Finally, on April 13, 2006, the first two brands, Greenville Pale Ale and Route 52 Pilsner, were launched. \r\n\r\nToday Twin Lakes Brewery also produces Tweed\u2019s Tavern Stout, Caesar Rodney Golden Ale and Winterthur Wheat, as well as seasonal styles Oktoberfest and Jublicious. Currently, Twin Lakes beer is available on tap at many fine restaurants and taverns in Delaware and Southeastern Pennsylvania. Growlers (half gallon jugs of beer) can be purchased at the brewery and kegs are available at most regional beer and liquor stores.","website":"http:\/\/twinlakesbrewingcompany.com\/","established":"2006","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/VcP5iA\/upload_9OCHk2-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/VcP5iA\/upload_9OCHk2-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/VcP5iA\/upload_9OCHk2-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/VcP5iA\/upload_9OCHk2-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/VcP5iA\/upload_9OCHk2-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:04:49","locations":[{"id":"1k3h3N","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"4210 Kennett Pike","locality":"Greenville","region":"Delaware","postalCode":"19807","phone":"302-658-1826","website":"http:\/\/twinlakesbrewingcompany.com\/","latitude":39.785885,"longitude":-75.602527,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"Y","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2006","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2016-05-13 19:47:14","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"CHewIB","name":"Calamity Jane","nameDisplay":"Calamity Jane","description":"Calamity Jane was known for being a legendary shot.

With the popularity of the beer growing, so did the brewery.\r\n\r\nIn December of 2009 we opened the doors to our new building and 30 barrel brewhouse.\r\n\r\nCrow Peak beers can be found on tap and in cans throughout South Dakota, North Dakota, Omaha, NE, and Eastern Wyoming. We are proud to distribute  11th Hour IPA,  Pile of Dirt Porter and Canyon Cream Ale, as well as a number of seasonal offerings.","website":"http:\/\/www.crowpeakbrewing.com\/","established":"2007","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/WkIaQj\/upload_AKmRs4-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/WkIaQj\/upload_AKmRs4-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/WkIaQj\/upload_AKmRs4-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/WkIaQj\/upload_AKmRs4-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/WkIaQj\/upload_AKmRs4-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:07:31","locations":[{"id":"bA9hdh","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"125 West Highway 14","locality":"Spearfish","region":"South Dakota","postalCode":"57783","phone":"605-717-0006","website":"http:\/\/www.crowpeakbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Thu: 4:00 pm - 9:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 2:00 pm - 10:00 pm\r\nSun: 12:00 pm - 8:00 pm","latitude":44.5177631,"longitude":-103.8710587,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2007","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:33:07","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"6vr88Y","name":"Cape Cod Beach Blonde Ale","nameDisplay":"Cape Cod Beach Blonde Ale","description":"Light and Refreshing: A very drinkable golden ale with a hint of toasted malt character and a clean finish.","abv":"4.9","ibu":"10","glasswareId":5,"availableId":1,"styleId":36,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:57","updateDate":"2015-04-21 13:38:35","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":36,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Golden or Blonde Ale","shortName":"Blonde","description":"Golden or Blonde ales are straw to golden blonde in color.

For the next 112 years, the facility operated under many names including the Frankenmuth Brewing Co. Ferdinand \u201cFred\u201d Schumacher from Duseldorf, Germany, purchased the brewery one year before a fire destroyed most of the structure in 1987.\r\n\r\nThe microbrewery continued operation following ownership acquisition by Randall E. Heine in 1990. The nation\u2019s second oldest microbrewery was at peak production in 1996, distributing more than 30,000 barrels of locally produced microbrews across 25 states, when a F3 tornado struck our facility, causing several million dollars of damage. A brew pub was opened in 2003 and closed three years later.\r\n\r\nOur Frankenmuth Brewing Company, housed in the historic four story, 28,000 square foot building is an exciting destination for food lovers and beer aficionados alike.","website":"http:\/\/frankenmuthbrewery.com\/","established":"1862","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/xUwGtE\/upload_1DNBW7-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/xUwGtE\/upload_1DNBW7-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/xUwGtE\/upload_1DNBW7-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/xUwGtE\/upload_1DNBW7-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/xUwGtE\/upload_1DNBW7-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:11:49","locations":[{"id":"IgdWNj","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"425 S Main Street","locality":"Frankenmuth","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"48734","phone":"989-262-8300","website":"http:\/\/frankenmuthbrewery.com\/","latitude":43.330981,"longitude":-83.737896,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1862","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"CzzDfl","name":"Cause & Effect","nameDisplay":"Cause & Effect","abv":"4.7","styleId":36,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-01-29 05:41:19","updateDate":"2016-02-12 16:55:23","style":{"id":36,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Golden or Blonde Ale","shortName":"Blonde","description":"Golden or Blonde ales are straw to golden blonde in color.

Brock was a longtime homebrewer and had considered opening a brewery as far back as college, although that was quickly dismissed as a silly idea. Seven years after graduating, Brock revisited the idea, enlisted Kevin's help and the brewery was off and running. Kevin has since left the business after a bitter battle.
