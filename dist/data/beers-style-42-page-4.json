While the small 5 gallon batches allowed for plenty of great experience, they yearned for more creative control.\r\n\r\nThe brewers decided it was time for a more professional three vessel system, giving them complete control over the brewing process. The 1\/2 barrel system gave the brewers a solid platform to refine and perfect a lineup of beers for the most discerning pallet. This led to the creation of several great recipes, and a roster of clean crisp beers. The original hobby transformed into a passion for sharing world-class hand crafted beers with those who would appreciate them. \r\n\r\nLevante Brewing currently brews on our 15 bbl production brewery system located in West Chester, PA.

All of our beers are brewed with the intention of creating something we'll enjoy drinking ourselves and, more importantly, something we're proud to put our name to. In a world of endless possibilities, we try to explore as many of them as possible, which is why to date we've brewed in excess of two hundred different beers: some of them regulars, the odd few occasionals, and far too many one-offs to remember let alone try to name!\r\nYou should be able to find our beers on offer nationwide in the kind of pubs and bars that have the freedom and willingness to stock good beer. While most of it goes into cask, you'll also find it in keg or bottle if you look in the right places.","website":"http:\/\/arborales.co.uk\/","established":"2007","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/3CT0MA\/upload_DEcqbY-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/3CT0MA\/upload_DEcqbY-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/3CT0MA\/upload_DEcqbY-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/3CT0MA\/upload_DEcqbY-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/3CT0MA\/upload_DEcqbY-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-08 08:41:02","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:42:45","locations":[{"id":"pguslr","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Unit 4 Lawrence Hill Industrial Park","extendedAddress":"Croydon Street","locality":"Lawrence Hill","region":"Bristol","postalCode":"BS5 0EB","latitude":51.4583567,"longitude":-2.5694249,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"GB","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-09 00:37:54","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"GB","name":"UNITED KINGDOM","displayName":"United Kingdom","isoThree":"GBR","numberCode":826,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"S0dgvI","name":"The Old Stillage","streetAddress":"147 Church Rd","extendedAddress":"Redfield","locality":"Bristol","postalCode":"BS5 9LA","phone":"0117 939 4079","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  4:00pm - 11:00pm\nTue:  4:00pm - 11:00pm\nWed:  4:00pm - 11:00pm\nThu:  4:00pm - 11:00pm\nFri:  4:00pm - 12:00am\nSat:  12:00pm - 12:00am\nSun:  12:00pm - 10:30pm\n\nMon-Thu 4pm-11pm;\r\nFri 4pm-12am;\r\nSat 12pm-12am;\r\nSun 12pm-10:30pm","latitude":51.4586634,"longitude":-2.5581766,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"GB","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-09 00:40:12","updateDate":"2014-08-25 19:12:59","country":{"isoCode":"GB","name":"UNITED KINGDOM","displayName":"United Kingdom","isoThree":"GBR","numberCode":826,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"4KMV4j","name":"The Three Tuns","streetAddress":"78 Saint George's Road","extendedAddress":"Hotwells","locality":"Bristol","postalCode":"BS1 5UR","phone":"0117 907 0689","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  12:00pm - 2:30pm\nTue:  12:00pm - 2:30pm\nWed:  12:00pm - 2:30pm\nThu:  12:00pm - 2:30pm\nFri:  12:00pm - 12:00am\nSat:  12:00pm - 12:00am\nSun:  4:00pm - 10:30pm\n\nMon-Thu 12pm-2.30pm & 4pm-11pm;\r\nFri-Sat 12pm-12am;\r\nSun 4pm-10:30pm","latitude":51.4511176,"longitude":-2.6049702,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"restaurant","locationTypeDisplay":"Restaurant\/Ale House","countryIsoCode":"GB","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-09 00:41:57","updateDate":"2014-08-25 19:13:00","country":{"isoCode":"GB","name":"UNITED KINGDOM","displayName":"United Kingdom","isoThree":"GBR","numberCode":826,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"I4vp71","name":"Breakout Stout","nameDisplay":"Breakout Stout","description":"Break out of your routine with our robust blend of dark roasted malts.
