In fact, he's managed to combine his scientific background with an artistic, if somewhat bohemian, flair for beermaking to create what The Globe and Mail and Vancouver Province newspapers have called some of the best suds around. \r\n\r\nBart's brewery skills are complemented by Tracey's tenacious management and marketing skills. Tracey has a degree in biology; but she too is immersed in the brewing business. She probably comes closest to using skills learned in courses such as zoology when calling on remote bars to demo cold Begbies to rowdy, and thirsty, patrons. \r\n\r\nThe brewery has seen expansion since it's beginnings.

The batches were small but the taste was gigantic, and word spread like wildfire.\r\n\r\nToday, our team brews at a larger production facility on the edge of town, regularly experimenting at the tap room to satisfy our craving for new and exciting creations. Numbers are not our game, making a lot of the same beer is just too boring, and life is just too short.\r\n\r\nThe history of Toppling Goliath lies in the dreams of tomorrow, not the pages of the past. The past is for those who rely on high volume and low value. The past is for those who duplicate rather than design. The past is for cowards.

This journey has opened our eyes (and taste buds) to some of the finest examples of beer this planet has to offer. Our tastes and expectations have forever changed, and so have our methods of enjoyment. From beer trades, to home brewing, to attending release parties and festivals one thing became clear\u2026 We rarely drink the same beer over and over again, and we love to share.\r\n\r\nOur IPAs will be constantly revolving depending on inspiration, hop variety, availability, and season. We will make everything from low gravity Sessions, to Regulars, Doubles, Triples and even a San Diego Pale Ale or two. We will make sure these styles are released, distributed, and tapped\u2026 FRESH!\r\n\r\nWe like big beers and we cannot lie! From the biggest Russian Imperial Stouts aged in spirit barrels to malty Double Reds, Smooth Porters, and velvety Wee Heavies, we just can\u2019t get enough of these complex beauties. Thick mouthfeel, high gravity, and rich flavors suitable for aging to be shared with family and friends. Crack one open to celebrate a special occasion, or just because its a Tuesday.\r\n\r\nMouth puckering sour ales is another style which we adore. One which we hoard, savor, and curse for not being more readily available. Using wine barrels from local Virginia Wineries we will age some carefully crafted super tart ales, blending them when needed and using fruits for character. Once the bugs catch up to our pipeline, expect a new sour to be released every month.\r\n\r\nAt Ocelot, we love two things\u2026 Beer and Music!\r\n\r\nWe believe in inspiration. It can come in many forms and varies from person to person. For us, music has always been our inspiration. Music has been the soundtrack to our lives and has in one way or another crafted every decision we\u2019ve made. We aim to create and dedicate our beers to the music that has inspired our journey through life.\r\n\r\nOcelot Brewing Company is a reflection of us, our styles, and our habits. From chasing freshies to cellaring whales and everything in between. We will craft many different beers in small batches. We brew beer we want to drink when we want to drink it.

My family was no different. I grew up hearing stories that cascaded across a broad plain of topics, but the ones that fascinated me most centered around the Kingsbury Breweries.\r\n\r\nBack in 1926, the Kingsbury Breweries, then known as the Gutsch Brewery, declared bankruptcy. It was a tough time for breweries across the country as Prohibition was in full effect. Many breweries failed during that time, and the Gutsch Brewery was on its way to joining them. It was at this time that my family took the helm of the brewery. Soon after, they changed the name to the Kingsbury Breweries, expanded coast-to-coast, and turned the brewery into what we remember it as today.\r\n\r\nI grew up hearing stories from my father, who, as a child with his father, would go around the various Kingsbury Breweries, see the brewers hard at work, and watch the customers enjoy a beer in the Ratskellar. This is where my interest was first piqued by the great world of beer. Many years later, thanks to a brilliant gift on my wife\u2019s part, I started making my own beer. From that point forward there was no turning back. The hobby turned into a passion, which turned into an obsession, which turned into quitting my day job and opening a brewery.\r\n\r\nThis is my Really Cool Waterslide - my choice to take a dream and make it my reality.

Our three flagship beers are an India Pale Ale (IPA), an Amber Ale, and a Wheat Beer. Our brewery was established in the Spring of 2012, the culmination of years of dreaming, drinking, hoping and planning. After all, what could be better than brewing beer for a living? It is an opportunity to spread the good cheer that comes with quality ales.","website":"http:\/\/www.deadarmadillobrewery.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TWODoR\/upload_UjPCfH-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TWODoR\/upload_UjPCfH-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TWODoR\/upload_UjPCfH-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TWODoR\/upload_UjPCfH-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TWODoR\/upload_UjPCfH-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-04-28 18:34:59","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:42:18","locations":[{"id":"KHd8BS","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"5866 S.

My family was no different. I grew up hearing stories that cascaded across a broad plain of topics, but the ones that fascinated me most centered around the Kingsbury Breweries.\r\n\r\nBack in 1926, the Kingsbury Breweries, then known as the Gutsch Brewery, declared bankruptcy. It was a tough time for breweries across the country as Prohibition was in full effect. Many breweries failed during that time, and the Gutsch Brewery was on its way to joining them. It was at this time that my family took the helm of the brewery. Soon after, they changed the name to the Kingsbury Breweries, expanded coast-to-coast, and turned the brewery into what we remember it as today.\r\n\r\nI grew up hearing stories from my father, who, as a child with his father, would go around the various Kingsbury Breweries, see the brewers hard at work, and watch the customers enjoy a beer in the Ratskellar. This is where my interest was first piqued by the great world of beer. Many years later, thanks to a brilliant gift on my wife\u2019s part, I started making my own beer. From that point forward there was no turning back. The hobby turned into a passion, which turned into an obsession, which turned into quitting my day job and opening a brewery.\r\n\r\nThis is my Really Cool Waterslide - my choice to take a dream and make it my reality.

There will be certain elements of the beer that will remain constant. The first batch in 2011 was brewed with Westmalle yeast, Galaxy hops from Australia, Nelson Sauvin hops from New Zealand. Additional additions of Lemon Verbena and Start Anise were added in the whirlpool. The beer had an enormous dank nose and a high level of finishing dryness and bitterness from the Lemon Verbena.  The 2012 batches followed a similar malt bill to the first batch but a different strain of Belgian yeast from the Ardenne region was chosen. A slightly lower level of Lemon Verbena was used and the hops chosen were Green Bullet and Mouteka both from New Zealand. Released for SF Beer Week 2012. Starting in 2013 we have switched over to an American Ale yeast strain but the focus on Southern Hemisphere hops is still a predominant feature of this beer. I hope you enjoy this seasonal treat.
