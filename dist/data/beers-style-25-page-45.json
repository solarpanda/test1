Soon he found himself president and heading up the Marin County State Fair competitions, and after burning out all the burners on the stove, he was banished to brewing outdoors. A certified beer judge, he worked at Marin Brewing Company before starting off on his own, moving south to Carpinteria. Now a family run brewery, Island Brewing Company has won awards on both the state and national level.

We work with other farmers growing vegetables such as tomatoes, cucumbers for pickles, and lettuce. The menu is streamlined with most items produced on-site including house made buns, sauerkraut and bacon. We use no artificial sweeteners, no high fructose corn syrup, and no hydrogenated oils.

We take wine seriously and feature farmer made, estate grown and bottled wines from around the world, which are served on-tap via the Enomatic self-serve wine-dispensing machine.\r\n\r\nCentral to Bull City Burger and Brewery\u2019s core values is sustainability; our attempt is to operate while leaving the smallest energy footprint possible.  Our long term goal is to become part of a cycle of energy with the restaurant playing an integral role in the farms we source. Grain left over from the brewing process will feed locally farmed pigs that provide pork bellies to make our bacon, and the fry oil will become bio-diesel to fuel vehicles.","website":"http:\/\/www.bullcityburgerandbrewery.com\/","established":"2011","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/visitor.r20.constantcontact.com\/manage\/optin\/ea?v=001qie9IeSPzo4U1KgkEFG5EQ%3D%3D","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/eu1cAn\/upload_OCIvTW-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/eu1cAn\/upload_OCIvTW-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/eu1cAn\/upload_OCIvTW-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/eu1cAn\/upload_OCIvTW-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/eu1cAn\/upload_OCIvTW-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:12:44","locations":[{"id":"vGotFH","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"107 East Parrish Street","extendedAddress":"Suite 105","locality":"Durham","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"27701","phone":"919-680-2333","website":"http:\/\/www.bullcityburgerandbrewery.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday - Thursday: 11:11am to 10pm\r\nFriday & Saturday:  11:11am to 11pm-ish\r\nClosed Sundays","latitude":35.995445,"longitude":-78.899939,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"5dhj7s","name":"Parrothead Pale Ale","nameDisplay":"Parrothead Pale Ale","description":"A smooth blend of specially toasted pale, caramel and Munich malts, balanced with the clean hop flavors of Liberty and Mt.

Both had been home brewing for years, and started brewing together in their back yards in the summer of 2010. The goal of the first brews was to make enough beer for Nate\u2019s upcoming wedding. In the ensuing months the two continued brewing on a regular basis, creating better beers, refining the equipment and process and devising some great new recipes. As they continued to brew together, talk turned to the idea of an eventual commercial venture.\r\n\r\nTJ, a mutual friend of the two brewers noted that he could provide some equipment to allow for some larger brewing projects. Having this greater capacity led to the realization, that as much fun as it might be to try, the three of them would not be able to drink nearly as much as they were certain to produce and the beer would have to be shared with the public. The wheels were officially set in motion to make the jump from hobbyists to professional brewers.\r\n\r\nTo round out the team, the trio turned to some other friends. Drew had joined in on the occasional brewing session, and one of his creations took home a prize at a local brewing competition. Ron brought to the table the business and accounting skills needed to make this a business. Five friends who enjoyed hanging out together had just hit on the magic formula to turn fun into a business.\r\n\r\nBucket opened its pilot brewery in the Lorraine Mills in Pawtucket. The space was a 375 square foot room, and the equipment was largely retooled and designed to create a 1 BBL brewery. The first keg of beer went on tap in November 2012 and within a couple of months it was clear that the demand was huge and a bigger brewery would be needed.\r\n\r\nIn June of 2013, the pilot brewery closed and construction began on a full scale production brewery in August. Located in the mill at 545 Pawtucket Avenue, the new space was nearly 10 times larger at 3400 square feet. With a 10 BBL brewhouse, the production capacity grew ten-fold as well.\r\n\r\nIn the Fall of 2013, brewing began in the new facility and in November, Bucket Brewery was officially opened to the public. In addition to the kegs of beer that were the exclusive packaging in the pilot site, Bucket started shipping beer in 64oz and 32oz containers. The beer has beer very well received by our Rhode Island customers and the brewery continues to grow!\r\n\r\nBucket now holds tours and tastings every Saturday, as well as the Friday Night Sound Check music and art series, and other events.","website":"http:\/\/bucketbrewery.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ZB3WRj\/upload_a6AxDn-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ZB3WRj\/upload_a6AxDn-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ZB3WRj\/upload_a6AxDn-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ZB3WRj\/upload_a6AxDn-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ZB3WRj\/upload_a6AxDn-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-21 13:02:25","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:05:11","locations":[{"id":"PwIQok","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"545 Pawtucket Ave","locality":"Pawtucket","region":"Rhode Island","postalCode":"02860","website":"bucketbrewery.com","hoursOfOperation":"Friday 1:00-7:30 \r\nSaturday 11:00-5:00","latitude":41.859093,"longitude":-71.398175,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-21 13:02:26","updateDate":"2015-11-19 22:15:08","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"EmEseF","name":"Payette Pale Ale","nameDisplay":"Payette Pale Ale","description":"Our Pale Ale is a beer made for the mountain, river, trail or even the local pub.
