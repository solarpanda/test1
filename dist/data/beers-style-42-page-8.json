Chris Hunt and Duncan Guy began their brewing education in the Barley Mob Brewers homebrewing club and continued to search for unique and distinctive ale and lager formulas. They decided to offer their creations to the public through a small batch microbrewery in 2006.  Soon thereafter, award-winning brewer Courtney Tyvand joined the two and presented his smoked porter at the brewery\u2019s first beer dinner in October of 2006.\r\n\r\nThe brewery is located on the ground floor of a historic building at 4015 Tennessee Avenue in St. Elmo.  The building is constructed of foot-square cedar timbers and two-foot thick walls made of granite stone and mortar.  Built in 1911 as a packaging factory for K-Rations for WWI, we occasionally find artifacts from that era in the building walls and ceiling.  The brewery shares space with the Chattanooga U-Brew, a brew-on-premises business owned by Greg McCort. \r\n\r\nMBBC is proud to offer small batch specialty ales and lagers in kegs of various sizes.  A tasting room is part of the brewery; samples of our beers can be tasted and tested on premises.

The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery. Goose Island beers are now enjoyed in all 50 states and Europe.","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:46:51","locations":[{"id":"S2n5TB","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1800 West Fulton Street","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60612","phone":"1-800-466-7363","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","latitude":41.887107,"longitude":-87.6720969,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:33:51","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"D2gG2C","name":"Clybourn","streetAddress":"1800 North Clybourn Avenue","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60614","phone":"800-466-7363","latitude":41.9137242,"longitude":-87.65373,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1988","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:32:55","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"waA7IQ","name":"Dublin Stout","nameDisplay":"Dublin Stout","abv":"6","styleId":42,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:07","updateDate":"2012-03-22 13:04:51","style":{"id":42,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Stout","shortName":"American Stout","description":"Initial low to medium malt sweetness with a degree of caramel, chocolate and\/or roasted coffee flavor with a distinctive dryroasted bitterness in the finish.

Starting with the creamy head that stouts are know for, this beer continues with a full mouthfeel and finishes with a roasted cocoa flavor.  Delivered at the brewery using nitrogen instead of CO2, this beer takes a bit longer to pour but is definitely worth the wait.\r\n\r\nInteresting Fact: There are a number of ways to impart chocolate flavor into a beer. For this beer, grains do part of the job, but it's the cocoa nibs which add most of it. The nibs allow the cocoa flavor in this beer to come through without too much sweetness like would be the case if we added processed chocolate.","abv":"6.1","ibu":"37","glasswareId":5,"availableId":1,"styleId":42,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"Brie, Pretzels, Grapes, Chocolate Cake, Cheese Cake","originalGravity":"1.061","createDate":"2012-07-15 22:38:17","updateDate":"2014-10-16 18:25:48","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":42,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Stout","shortName":"American Stout","description":"Initial low to medium malt sweetness with a degree of caramel, chocolate and\/or roasted coffee flavor with a distinctive dryroasted bitterness in the finish.
