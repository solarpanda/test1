Weissbier is well attenuated and very highly carbonated, yet its relatively high starting gravity and alcohol content make it a medium- to full-bodied beer. The color is very pale to deep golden. Because the beer has been filtered, yeast is not present. The beer will have no flavor of yeast and a cleaner, drier mouthfeel. The beer should be clear with no chill haze present. No diacetyl should be perceived.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"15","abvMin":"4.9","abvMax":"5.5","srmMin":"3","srmMax":"9","ogMin":"1.047","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:29:35"},"breweries":[{"id":"bH4OLS","name":"Brauerei Zoller-Hof","nameShortDisplay":"Brauerei Zoller-Hof","website":"http:\/\/www.zoller-hof.de\/","established":"1845","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-07 10:17:29","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:31:56","locations":[{"id":"8cp8pE","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Leopoldstrasse 40","locality":"Sigmaringen","region":"Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg","postalCode":"72488","latitude":48.091042,"longitude":9.206585,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-12 14:46:36","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"VHrzRK","name":"Zwiefalter Kloster-Weizen kristallklar","nameDisplay":"Zwiefalter Kloster-Weizen kristallklar","abv":"5.2","styleId":49,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-12 12:05:51","updateDate":"2012-08-19 15:46:29","style":{"id":49,"categoryId":4,"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"South German-Style Kristall Weizen \/ Kristall Weissbier","shortName":"Kristallweizen","description":"The aroma and flavor of a Weissbier without yeast is very similar to Weissbier with yeast (Hefeweizen\/Hefeweissbier) with the caveat that fruity and phenolic characters are not combined with the yeasty flavor and fuller-bodied mouthfeel of yeast. The phenolic characteristics are often described as clove- or nutmeg-like and can be smoky or even vanilla-like. Banana-like esters are often present. These beers are made with at least 50 percent malted wheat, and hop rates are quite low. Hop flavor and aroma are absent.
