This customized equipment allows us to make truly exceptional beer with a high level of consistency. \r\n\r\nEquipment doesn\u2019t begin and end in the brew house. An often-overlooked main ingredient in beer is the water. Often brewers will believe that their local water source adds to their individuality of their product, or what wine makers call terroir. While this may be true to a large extent it overlooks the importance of a beer style\u2019s original water source when trying to replicate a specific style.  Without our Reverse Osmosis water filtration system we feel that producing a beer originating from a region with \u201csoft\u201d water just wouldn\u2019t bring that beer justice, being that our own regional water is extremely hard.  Reverse Osmosis gives us flexibility and allows us to properly pay respect and more accurately replicate brewing traditions from all over the world.\r\n \r\nOur brewing system also wouldn\u2019t be complete without putting thought into the storage of our beer. Many fantastic beers leave breweries and then suffer the consequences of entering the distribution chain that wasn\u2019t at all designed to deal with craft beer. At Garage Brewing Co, we choose our guest beer that has been handled with the utmost care, and we store our own beer just steps from where it was brewed and fermented.

In 2010 we planted our flag in Downtown Fresno, CA and decided to take our journey of becoming the San Joaquin Valley\u2019s local brewery a step further. Our beer and brands reflect the greatness of the region we brew in. We highlight the beauty of the Southern Sierras that run along the Eastern side of the San Joaquin Valley that include landmarks such as Yosemite National Park, Sierra National Forest, Sequoia National Park, Kings Canyon National Park, and Sequoia National Forest. We also integrate and feature local flavor, creativity, and culture in our products to give our valley residents a sense of pride in what they drink and support.\r\n\r\nOur award-winning Brewmaster, Kevin Cox, has been spent over 20 years in the brewing industry. He began his career as a cellar master\/production manager for Heitz Wine Cellars in the Napa Valley from 1979-1989. He then moved to Fresno to help in the founding of Butterfield Brewing Company, a San Joaquin Valley favorite for many years. Butterfields Brewing Company evolved into Sequoia Brewing Co in 2003 and during his tenure with both breweries he won five gold medals at the Great American Beer Festival in Denver, Colorado, as well as numerous regional and State awards. In 2010 Kevin became head brewmaster at Tioga-Sequoia Brewing Co. and helped to build our current downtown brewery.\r\n\r\nAll Tioga-Sequoia products are brewed in downtown Fresno, California. We recently renovated our grain warehouse to become a tasting room in a Beer Garden style fashion. Our hope is that the #TSBeerGarden will bring new life to our city\u2019s downtown with an outdoor venue that provides a unique variety of fresh, local craft beer with an urban atmosphere. We host numerous types of events monthly that include live music, art shows, and food trucks. The Beer Garden has regular hours for onsite consumption with bottles, kegs and growlers to go.","website":"http:\/\/www.tioga-sequoia.com","established":"2007","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/f3JwxU\/upload_Eujdf7-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/f3JwxU\/upload_Eujdf7-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/f3JwxU\/upload_Eujdf7-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/f3JwxU\/upload_Eujdf7-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/f3JwxU\/upload_Eujdf7-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-08-19 16:26:44","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:15:10","locations":[{"id":"wdjaPp","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"745 Fulton St.","locality":"Fresno","region":"California","phone":"(559) 486-2337","latitude":36.7314814,"longitude":-119.7881204,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-08-19 19:20:56","updateDate":"2015-08-19 19:20:56","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"NJnesH","name":"Milk and Honey","nameDisplay":"Milk and Honey","styleId":44,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/NJnesH\/upload_qNVhnp-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/NJnesH\/upload_qNVhnp-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/NJnesH\/upload_qNVhnp-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-16 12:39:22","updateDate":"2015-12-17 22:35:50","style":{"id":44,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Specialty Stouts","shortName":"Stout","description":"See British Origin American-Style Imperial Porter Imperial porters are very dark brown to black in color.

The name Berlin is believed to be derived from a contraction of \"Burleigh Inn\", a tavern located at the crossroads of the Philadelphia Post Road (now South Main Street) and Sinepuxent Road (Tripoli Street).\r\n\r\nIt just so happens, that our building was originally a Cooperage - making oak barrels to fill with local produce and seafood to ship off to Baltimore in the early 1900's. And we are bringing barrels back to the building, aiding us in the aging of our hand-crafted ales.","website":"http:\/\/www.burleyoak.com\/","established":"2011","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/burleyoak.us8.list-manage.com\/subscribe?u=e9e9f1b229013eb1f9c176a6d&id=08ec5affe2","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:17:12","locations":[{"id":"dB9k9t","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"10016 Old Ocean City Blvd","locality":"Berlin","region":"Maryland","postalCode":"21811","phone":"410-422-8887","website":"http:\/\/www.burleyoak.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday 11am-11pm \r\nThursday, Friday, and Saturday 11am-2am\r\nSunday 12pm - 9pm","latitude":38.3338561,"longitude":-75.2169099,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"94D4jz","name":"Nightmare on Gothard St.","nameDisplay":"Nightmare on Gothard St.","description":"Better lock your door and grab a glass, this one\u2019s coming for you!

We have been hard at work building this brewery keeping in mind sustainable practices and using local materials and craftsmen. We love our town of Berlin, Maryland and hope you join us in our taproom for a couple of pints and growlers. Our goal is to produce distinctive beers whose quaility is unsurpassed using new and traditional brewing methods.\r\n\r\nWhy \"Burley Oak?\"\r\n\r\nThe inspiration for our name Burley Oak Brewing Company was derived from the name of the town, our traditional brewing methods and the history of our brewhouse. \r\n\r\nBerlin, Maryland in Wikipedia \r\nThe town of Berlin had its start around the 1790s, part of the Burley Plantation, a 300-acre (1.2 km2) land grant dating back to 1677. The name Berlin is believed to be derived from a contraction of \"Burleigh Inn\", a tavern located at the crossroads of the Philadelphia Post Road (now South Main Street) and Sinepuxent Road (Tripoli Street).\r\n\r\nIt just so happens, that our building was originally a Cooperage - making oak barrels to fill with local produce and seafood to ship off to Baltimore in the early 1900's. And we are bringing barrels back to the building, aiding us in the aging of our hand-crafted ales.","website":"http:\/\/www.burleyoak.com\/","established":"2011","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/burleyoak.us8.list-manage.com\/subscribe?u=e9e9f1b229013eb1f9c176a6d&id=08ec5affe2","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:17:12","locations":[{"id":"dB9k9t","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"10016 Old Ocean City Blvd","locality":"Berlin","region":"Maryland","postalCode":"21811","phone":"410-422-8887","website":"http:\/\/www.burleyoak.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday 11am-11pm \r\nThursday, Friday, and Saturday 11am-2am\r\nSunday 12pm - 9pm","latitude":38.3338561,"longitude":-75.2169099,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"ApgqMs","name":"No Manners Smoked Stout","nameDisplay":"No Manners Smoked Stout","description":"'No Manners' Smoked Stout has a rich yet well balanced malt front, abruptly followed by an intense smokiness derived from the intriguing German smoked malt.","abv":"5.2","ibu":"30","styleId":44,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-08-04 16:16:18","updateDate":"2015-08-04 16:16:18","style":{"id":44,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Specialty Stouts","shortName":"Stout","description":"See British Origin American-Style Imperial Porter Imperial porters are very dark brown to black in color.

In 1997 Elysian was chosen to operate a pub and small brewery at Gameworks\u2014a large entertainment complex owned by Universal Studios, Dreamworks & Sega. Elysian left this partnership in 2002 upon expiration of the five-year contract. A short year later Elysian opened TangleTown, an 80-seat neighborhood brewery\/bistro. With a 3-bbl pilot brewery, Elysian-TangleTown acted as the brewers' test kitchen, fueling the creative fires and helping cement Elysian's reputation as Seattle\u2019s top brewpub. The most recent addition to the Elysian empire, Elysian Fields, opened in August 2006. Perched next to Seattle\u2019s two sports arenas, Fields seats 400 and packs the house at lunch and on gamedays.
