Previously known as the \u201cBib Corner\u201d, this location has an interesting historical past. Originally designed for the Peninsula restaurant, this three story structure was built by Nicholas Bauman in 1874.\r\n\r\nThis elegant restaurant gave way to the Franklin and Folz clothing store from 1884 to 1924. Through the years, the building housed a succession of businesses, including the Kalamazoo Stove company, a book bindery and a hotel.\r\n\r\nIt became the headquarters for W.R.

Our beer is made with natural ingredients and no pretense. We've been known to throw in a few spices or fruits into our beer. Our most popular beer, Pork Slap Pale Ale is sweet and malty, brewed with fresh ginger root. Heinnieweisse is a German-style weissebier with tart citrus and banana notes. For all our hopheads, Snapperhead is an American IPA with light spicy and earthy hop flavors. And don't forget about Moo Thunder American Stout with its espresso, dark chocolate, smoky flavor.\r\nWe change up the beer on draft pretty regularly, so stop by often. You can sample all our year-round brews, plus any specialty styles we have on draft. Take a tour of our brewery and learn about the brewing process, ingredients and history.

Our Head Brewer frequently traveled to Europe over the past couple years.  He has been fortunate to have experienced the wonderful beers that have historically defined many current craft beer styles.  As we pay homage to these great and historic beers, we\u2019ll add an American Flair that will be embraced in the Carolinas and beyond.","website":"http:\/\/www.nodabrewing.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/pcrctk\/upload_YHM8QJ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/pcrctk\/upload_YHM8QJ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/pcrctk\/upload_YHM8QJ-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/pcrctk\/upload_YHM8QJ-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/pcrctk\/upload_YHM8QJ-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:03","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:20:43","locations":[{"id":"oGBBGF","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2229 North Davidson St","locality":"Charlotte","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"28205","phone":"(704) 900-6851","website":"http:\/\/www.nodabrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday - 4 - 8:30\r\nTuesday - 4-8:30\r\nWednesday - 4-9\r\nThursday- 4-8:30\r\nFriday - 4-9:30\r\nSaturday - 12-10\r\nSunday - 1-6","latitude":35.240347,"longitude":-80.814842,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:03","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"wA5pW7","name":"Morning Session Stout","nameDisplay":"Morning Session Stout","abv":"4.2","ibu":"23","styleId":42,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-11-03 19:44:50","updateDate":"2015-11-03 19:44:50","style":{"id":42,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Stout","shortName":"American Stout","description":"Initial low to medium malt sweetness with a degree of caramel, chocolate and\/or roasted coffee flavor with a distinctive dryroasted bitterness in the finish.

It's actually an oatmeal stout if you want to get right down to it.\r\n\r\n A series of happy accidents lead to the Muddy Creek recipe. It truly was a long time in the making. The stout developed over years of trial and error until the perfect storm came together to create the right texture and flavor profile.\r\n\r\n Muddy Creek is pleasant not only for its flavor but for its fullness and complexity. Generally a \"chocolate stout\" is so named for it's color, not specifically for any particular flavor profiles. In fact, stouts are more notable for strong coffee or roasted barley flavors than anything else. However, in the case of Muddy Creek, we have actually made efforts to incorporate chocolate flavors into the recipe which enhance the aroma, flavor and natural bitterness of the stout. These flavors mix naturally with the coffee undercurrent of the stout to form a nice blend. Add the silky mouth-feel from the oats and you have a very unique experience.\r\n\r\n We were so happy with how Muddy Creek turned out as a beer that we named the brewery after it. We hope you'll like it too. We currently serve our stout on both CO2 and on Nitro.

For the next 112 years, the facility operated under many names including the Frankenmuth Brewing Co. Ferdinand \u201cFred\u201d Schumacher from Duseldorf, Germany, purchased the brewery one year before a fire destroyed most of the structure in 1987.\r\n\r\nThe microbrewery continued operation following ownership acquisition by Randall E. Heine in 1990. The nation\u2019s second oldest microbrewery was at peak production in 1996, distributing more than 30,000 barrels of locally produced microbrews across 25 states, when a F3 tornado struck our facility, causing several million dollars of damage.

The first beers brewed by the brothers were designed to be a departure from the fairly bleak craft brewing scene in the region. Nick and Simon brewed intense balanced beers that were and still remain \u201cnot normal\u201d by conventional standards.\r\n\r\nIn November of 2005, after receiving numerous visitors to the brewery over the years, Three Floyds opened its own brewpub at the production facility.

All of our beer produced in 2012 will include at least 25% organic, locally-malted grain with the eventual goal of improving to 100%. \r\n\r\nBrewmaster Jack is proud to have our beer produced at Paper City Brewery in Holyoke, Massachusetts.","website":"http:\/\/www.brewmasterjack.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/khl03j\/upload_nn1fNs-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/khl03j\/upload_nn1fNs-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/khl03j\/upload_nn1fNs-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/khl03j\/upload_nn1fNs-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/khl03j\/upload_nn1fNs-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-04-17 19:06:48","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:29:05","locations":[{"id":"Qi0V9u","name":"Paper City Brewery Company","streetAddress":"108 Cabot St","locality":"Holyoke","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"01040","phone":"413-367-7190","website":"http:\/\/www.brewmasterjack.com\/index.html","latitude":42.2011759,"longitude":-72.610427,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-10-01 18:49:41","updateDate":"2014-10-01 18:49:41","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"wCUlHf","name":"NEGATIVE GHOST RIDER HOPPY STOUT","nameDisplay":"NEGATIVE GHOST RIDER HOPPY STOUT","abv":"6.7","ibu":"50","styleId":42,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/wCUlHf\/upload_PY468G-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/wCUlHf\/upload_PY468G-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/wCUlHf\/upload_PY468G-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-15 20:36:44","updateDate":"2015-12-17 23:59:08","style":{"id":42,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Stout","shortName":"American Stout","description":"Initial low to medium malt sweetness with a degree of caramel, chocolate and\/or roasted coffee flavor with a distinctive dryroasted bitterness in the finish.
