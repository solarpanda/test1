The process of appreciation through education we call beer liberation.\r\n\r\nToday Short\u2019s Brewing Company continues the effort to educate and liberate consumers.  We take pride in our hands on, mom and pop approach and the energy we put into the quality of our beer, food, staff, customers and facilities. We believe in the power of the smallness.   We intend on remaining a smaller, state wide beer distributor and focusing our energies close to home (the SBC Michigan stimulus package).

In 1924 the Fort George Building was erected to house an automotive repair facility until the late 1990's. Briefly abandoned and sadly neglected, the Fort George building has been recently revitalized as a home to the Blue Schorcher Bakery and our brewpub. We are honored to play a part in the Fort and Astoria's renaissance.","website":"http:\/\/www.fortgeorgebrewery.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/EqYxQd\/upload_TTd7IQ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/EqYxQd\/upload_TTd7IQ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/EqYxQd\/upload_TTd7IQ-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/EqYxQd\/upload_TTd7IQ-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/EqYxQd\/upload_TTd7IQ-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:04:28","locations":[{"id":"Pb4Zwl","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1483 Duane St.","locality":"Astoria","region":"Oregon","postalCode":"97103","phone":"503-325-PINT","website":"http:\/\/www.fortgeorgebrewery.com\/","latitude":46.1885243,"longitude":-123.8275961,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"yd0A50","name":"CEA NYC Hotel Room","nameDisplay":"CEA NYC Hotel Room","abv":"10","styleId":42,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-01-04 17:03:03","updateDate":"2016-01-04 17:03:03","style":{"id":42,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Stout","shortName":"American Stout","description":"Initial low to medium malt sweetness with a degree of caramel, chocolate and\/or roasted coffee flavor with a distinctive dryroasted bitterness in the finish.

This limited release is brewed to an opaque, midnight black shade with an abundance of Specialty malted and roasted barley and plenty of East Kent Golding and Northern Brewer hops directly from the hop farms in the UK.  Lights Out Stout enjoys a complex taste profile of coffee, chocolate, and toffee and at 9.1% ABV it's a real sipper on a cool Fall or Winter evening.\r\nThis is a robust, yet well balanced, Stout with hints of chocolate, coffee, toffee, and Carmel and a solid roasted barley back bone. It pours a dark black with a full head of tan foam and enjoys a dominate chocolate and coffee aroma.  From your first sip, there is no mistake that this style has plenty of fresh hops; however the full malted barley backbone hides any hint of bitterness.  This is a well balanced Russian Imperial Stout with a generous ABV at 9.1% and full flavor.

This customized equipment allows us to make truly exceptional beer with a high level of consistency. \r\n\r\nEquipment doesn\u2019t begin and end in the brew house. An often-overlooked main ingredient in beer is the water. Often brewers will believe that their local water source adds to their individuality of their product, or what wine makers call terroir. While this may be true to a large extent it overlooks the importance of a beer style\u2019s original water source when trying to replicate a specific style.  Without our Reverse Osmosis water filtration system we feel that producing a beer originating from a region with \u201csoft\u201d water just wouldn\u2019t bring that beer justice, being that our own regional water is extremely hard.  Reverse Osmosis gives us flexibility and allows us to properly pay respect and more accurately replicate brewing traditions from all over the world.\r\n \r\nOur brewing system also wouldn\u2019t be complete without putting thought into the storage of our beer. Many fantastic beers leave breweries and then suffer the consequences of entering the distribution chain that wasn\u2019t at all designed to deal with craft beer. At Garage Brewing Co, we choose our guest beer that has been handled with the utmost care, and we store our own beer just steps from where it was brewed and fermented. Our 10 BBL serving vessels ensure beer delivery in its freshest form and our draft\/tap system is highly engineered to ensure that we can pour our guests a proper pint.\r\n\r\nMany hours of thought and years of experience have been drawn from to ensure that Garage Brewing Co not only produces and serves and exceptional beer to its guests but does so in a way that respects the old world traditions.","website":"http:\/\/www.garagebrewco.com\/","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wGMKzx\/upload_fKNQhd-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wGMKzx\/upload_fKNQhd-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wGMKzx\/upload_fKNQhd-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wGMKzx\/upload_fKNQhd-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wGMKzx\/upload_fKNQhd-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-04-15 13:24:23","updateDate":"2016-01-19 22:24:25","locations":[{"id":"Jki0lE","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"29095 Old Town Front Street","locality":"Temecula","region":"California","postalCode":"92590","phone":"(951) 587-2537","website":"http:\/\/www.garagebrewco.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Thu: 11:30 am - 9:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:30 am - 10:00 pm\r\nSun: 11:30 am - 9:00 pm","latitude":33.4825051,"longitude":-117.1432478,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-04-15 13:25:18","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"UZSZJI","name":"Chocolate Macadamia Nut Stout","nameDisplay":"Chocolate Macadamia Nut Stout","description":"Dark malts accompanied by chocolate and crystal malts, cold conditioned with a chocolate macadamia nut infusion.","abv":"4.3","availableId":1,"styleId":42,"isOrganic":"Y","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-05-11 14:16:40","updateDate":"2015-05-11 14:16:40","available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":42,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Stout","shortName":"American Stout","description":"Initial low to medium malt sweetness with a degree of caramel, chocolate and\/or roasted coffee flavor with a distinctive dryroasted bitterness in the finish.
