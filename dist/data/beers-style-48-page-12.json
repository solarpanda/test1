It was a \u201cbrown beer\u201d brewery as was customary in those times. While a great deal has changed in the meantime, essential features have survived. Thus, Maxlrain is and remains a local private brewery under independent management. The fifteen styles of beer classified under pale ale, dark ale, Pils or wheat beer are all brewed applying manual skills utilizing finest ingredients enhanced by our own source of spring water drawn from the Mangfall Valley.","website":"http:\/\/www.maxlrain.de\/","established":"1636","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/r6wXzi\/upload_rvZZGP-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/r6wXzi\/upload_rvZZGP-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/r6wXzi\/upload_rvZZGP-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/r6wXzi\/upload_rvZZGP-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/r6wXzi\/upload_rvZZGP-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-05-30 20:25:26","updateDate":"2016-04-04 19:55:15","locations":[{"id":"1CemsR","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Aiblinger Str. 1","locality":"Maxlrain","region":"Tuntenhausen","postalCode":"83104","phone":"+49 (0)8061 \/ 9079-0","website":"http:\/\/www.maxlrain.de\/en\/","latitude":47.89838,"longitude":11.98821,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-10-08 17:12:19","updateDate":"2016-04-04 20:03:54","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Cu4fqe","name":"Leon-Weizen","nameDisplay":"Leon-Weizen","styleId":48,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-12 12:19:10","updateDate":"2012-08-19 13:04:26","style":{"id":48,"categoryId":4,"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"South German-Style Hefeweizen \/ Hefeweissbier","shortName":"Hefeweizen","description":"The aroma and flavor of a Weissbier with yeast is decidedly fruity and phenolic.
