The Slo-Hi location was developed to allow a local clientele, as well as beer aficionados and lovers of good times a central spot in Denver to enjoy a proper pint and have a chat. We will always have three to four great beers on tap via CO2 pressurized kegs and plan to maintain properly conditioned Real Ale from naturally carbonated casks served from beer engines for those that enjoy this traditional British libation. The brewing system and associated cellar has been custom designed with an integrated control system, that allow the brewer to process from one to ten barrels in a batch process and ferment in temperature controlled Stainless Steel vessels. Each of the beers have been formulated from carefully selected malted barley, treated water, multiple varieties of hops, and a specific yeast strain to produce the flavor, mouth-feel, alcohol content, aroma and bitterness, as well as the complex flavor profile according to the time and temperature recipe intended by the brewer. In addition to the attention to detail required for consistent and repeatable brews the brewmaster and support personnel follow a disciplined regiment of cleaning manually, and automatically with Clean-In-Place Systems (CIP) to exclude off-flavors, contaminants, and other undesirables in our beers. Every beer we serve has been naturally processed without the assistance of filtration which is why we are intensely focused on the highest quality ingredients, temperature controls, and finish aging to serve a quality product that we hope you enjoy as much as we do.","website":"http:\/\/www.hogsheadbrewery.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/otXCdW\/upload_pJQGom-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/otXCdW\/upload_pJQGom-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/otXCdW\/upload_pJQGom-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/otXCdW\/upload_pJQGom-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/otXCdW\/upload_pJQGom-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-10-16 14:20:59","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:00:18","locations":[{"id":"B43raw","name":"Hogshead Brewery and Tap Room","streetAddress":"4460 W 29th Ave","locality":"Denver","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"80212","phone":"303-495-3105","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\nTue:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\nWed:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\nThu:  12:00pm - 10:00pm\nFri:  12:00pm - 10:00pm\nSat:  12:00pm - 10:00pm\nSun:  12:00pm - 10:00pm\n\n","latitude":39.7581892,"longitude":-105.045106,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-10-16 14:31:27","updateDate":"2014-10-16 14:31:27","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"ll6ASr","name":"Downtown Nut Brown","nameDisplay":"Downtown Nut Brown","styleId":12,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-11-15 16:41:30","updateDate":"2012-11-15 16:41:31","style":{"id":12,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"English-Style Brown Ale","shortName":"English Brown","description":"English brown ales range from copper to brown in color.

Each of our craft beers will be highlighted and served in it's own special glass that will enhance the look, feel and flavor of the brewed product.","website":"http:\/\/www.headstrongbrewery.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0GgoFA\/upload_6r3H9T-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0GgoFA\/upload_6r3H9T-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0GgoFA\/upload_6r3H9T-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0GgoFA\/upload_6r3H9T-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0GgoFA\/upload_6r3H9T-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-18 17:50:13","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:58:56","locations":[{"id":"gLx8is","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"126 N 3rd St","locality":"Douglas","region":"Wyoming","postalCode":"82633","phone":"(307)359-8801","latitude":42.760612,"longitude":-105.384466,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"Y","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-18 17:53:48","updateDate":"2014-09-18 17:53:48","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"NhswZu","name":"English Brown Ale","nameDisplay":"English Brown Ale","abv":"5","availableId":1,"styleId":12,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-05-22 15:16:47","updateDate":"2015-05-26 18:56:22","available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":12,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"English-Style Brown Ale","shortName":"English Brown","description":"English brown ales range from copper to brown in color.

That early Web site helped generate positive press coverage and helped attract the investors needed to make the virtual brewery a real one. Muller said the idea was to make the Web site \u201cThis Old House meets the World Wide Web\u201d\u2014letting people go behind the taps and see the thousands of details needed to put a microbrewery together.\r\n\r\nHe also wanted to give beer lovers a chance, via their computers, to roll up their cyber-sleeves and help build the brewery. The site let beer lovers help select and name beers, design t-shirts and labels, volunteer to be a taste-tester and even apply for a job as a brewer. Visitors to the Web site can sign up for FlyingFishMail a monthly e-mail newsletter which now boasts more than 12,000 subscribers.\r\n\r\nMuller, who got into the brewing field to become a brewer, trained at Chicago's Siebel Institute of Technology, America's oldest brewing school. He quickly realized someone was going to have to run the day-to-day business of the brewery and now serves as President and Head Janitor (though not necessarily in that order).\r\n\r\nFlying Fish Brewing Company is located in Somerdale, New Jersey, approximately seven miles east of Philadelphia. In a state that once boasted 50 breweries, it is the first microbrewery in Southern New Jersey and the first new brewery built in that part of the state in more than half a century. From its opening in late 1996, Flying Fish has tripled its capacity and become the largest of the approximately 20 craft breweries in the state.","website":"http:\/\/www.flyingfish.com\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/M5zcKb\/upload_itowqN-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/M5zcKb\/upload_itowqN-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/M5zcKb\/upload_itowqN-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/M5zcKb\/upload_itowqN-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/M5zcKb\/upload_itowqN-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:46:07","locations":[{"id":"qjZIZq","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"900 Kennedy Boulevard","locality":"Somerdale","region":"New Jersey","postalCode":"08083","phone":"856-504-3442","website":"http:\/\/www.flyingfish.com\/","latitude":39.853834,"longitude":-75.019803,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"MfiJWd","name":"Fall Down Brown","nameDisplay":"Fall Down Brown","description":"This dark amber beer uses English crystal and base malts to create a rich malt profile.

While visiting relatives in Bavaria, Germany and having traveled numerous times to the great brewing countries of the UK and Europe, Mark came to this simple conclusion, \u201cAmerican beers are boring and just are not very satisfying\u201d. In Europe and the UK every area had its own local brewery and the beer was fresh and had flavor and a lot of body. So his quest to bring premium fresh flavorful beers to his town was born.\r\n\r\nWorking as an apprentice with some of the original craft brewers in California, it gave him an a working knowledge and appreciation as well as insight into the business of craft beer. Heritage Brewing was co-founded by Mark in 1989 and was Orange County\u2019s first micro brewery (brewpub) and they also became known as the premier live blues venue in the OC. Several years later Mark founded his production facility in Riverside County and produced products under Heritage\u2019s label as well as producing white label products for restaurants such as Claim Jumper, Wahoo\u2019s, BJ\u2019s Pizza, etc. In addition, Mark's facility produced and packaged many bottled products that have sold in all major retailers throughout So Cal.\r\n\r\nMark has brewed on various systems from 7bbl to 110 bbl, as well as installations and recipe formulations for many local brewpubs. Mark has received numerous awards from local beer festivals, state fairs, national and international beer festivals. Having received over 20 awards ranging from best of show, blue ribbons, bronze, silver and gold, with a Gold medal at the Great American Beer Festival, you can rest assured that the philosophy surrounding Mark, is a quality product every time. Mark's Nut Brown Ale was also celebrated in Michael Jacksons world pocket guide to beer as \u201cworld class\u201d .","website":"http:\/\/www.legacybrewingco.com","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QXkarn\/upload_g7ZFSX-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QXkarn\/upload_g7ZFSX-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QXkarn\/upload_g7ZFSX-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QXkarn\/upload_g7ZFSX-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QXkarn\/upload_g7ZFSX-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-16 21:36:58","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:52:30","locations":[{"id":"HIzVEo","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"363 Airport Road","locality":"Oceanside","region":"California","postalCode":"92058","phone":"(760) 705-3221","website":"http:\/\/www.legacybrewingco.com","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Sun: 11:00 am - 11:00 pm","latitude":33.2153901,"longitude":-117.3507698,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-16 21:37:30","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"JbA8ks","name":"Tap and Kitchen","streetAddress":"7060 Miramar Road, Ste 100","locality":"San Diego","region":"California","postalCode":"92121","phone":"858-695-9953","website":"http:\/\/legacybrewingtapandkitchen.com","latitude":32.8793454,"longitude":-117.1637115,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-04-24 07:02:09","updateDate":"2016-05-12 20:33:39","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"ZKa6lT","name":"Gentleman's Relish","nameDisplay":"Gentleman's Relish","description":"Our Northern English Brown Ale; strikes a nice balance between caramelly roastiness and clean hoppiness.","abv":"4.9","glasswareId":5,"availableId":1,"styleId":12,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/ZKa6lT\/upload_wF4G7C-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/ZKa6lT\/upload_wF4G7C-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/ZKa6lT\/upload_wF4G7C-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-11-02 12:15:44","updateDate":"2015-12-16 19:14:18","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":12,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"English-Style Brown Ale","shortName":"English Brown","description":"English brown ales range from copper to brown in color.

Shmaltz is known for blurring beer styles and using puns, art, history, and pop culture in every aspect of its products. \r\n\r\nFounded as the first and still only \"Jewish-celebration beer,\" proprietor Jeremy Cowan established the company in San Francisco in 1996 with the first 100 cases of He\u2019brew Beer hand bottled and delivered throughout the Bay Area in his Grandmother\u2019s Volvo. He\u2019brew now sells across 35 states, through 40 wholesalers and nearly 5,000 retailers. \r\n\r\nAfter 17 years of being an outspoken cheerleader for contract brewing, Shmaltz recently broke with tradition and opened its own New York State production brewery in Clifton Park, NY, 10 minutes north of Albany\u2019s capital district. Shmaltz\u2019s new home boasts a 50-barrel brewhouse with 30,000 barrels of annual capacity. The new brewery packages 12 and 22 ounce bottles and kegs of their diverse core and seasonal favorites, and hosts fans and beer tourists in their new tasting room for tours, barrel-aged previews, and special releases.","website":"http:\/\/www.shmaltzbrewing.com\/","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/hgjj29\/upload_awEQwK-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/hgjj29\/upload_awEQwK-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/hgjj29\/upload_awEQwK-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/hgjj29\/upload_awEQwK-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/hgjj29\/upload_awEQwK-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:57:55","locations":[{"id":"jivaao","name":"San Francisco","streetAddress":"912 Cole St.","extendedAddress":"#338","locality":"San Francisco","region":"California","postalCode":"94117","phone":"818-825-8765","website":"http:\/\/www.shmaltz.com\/","latitude":37.7654594,"longitude":-122.4497845,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2014-10-02 17:11:22","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"FwJ3bJ","name":"Clifton Park","streetAddress":"6 Fairchild Square","locality":"Clifton Park","region":"New York","postalCode":"12065","phone":"518-406-5430","website":"http:\/\/www.shmaltzbrewing.com\/","latitude":42.9014992,"longitude":-73.7928352,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-06 11:23:55","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:26:22","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"xy2NyO","name":"Brooklyn","streetAddress":"3008 W 12th St","locality":"Brooklyn","region":"New York","postalCode":"11224","phone":"(415) 298-1507","website":"http:\/\/www.shmaltz.com\/","latitude":40.5753162,"longitude":-73.9796725,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2010","yearClosed":"2012","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2013-11-21 17:09:30","updateDate":"2014-10-02 17:07:48","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
