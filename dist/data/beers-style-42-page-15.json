This customized equipment allows us to make truly exceptional beer with a high level of consistency. \r\n\r\nEquipment doesn\u2019t begin and end in the brew house. An often-overlooked main ingredient in beer is the water. Often brewers will believe that their local water source adds to their individuality of their product, or what wine makers call terroir. While this may be true to a large extent it overlooks the importance of a beer style\u2019s original water source when trying to replicate a specific style.  Without our Reverse Osmosis water filtration system we feel that producing a beer originating from a region with \u201csoft\u201d water just wouldn\u2019t bring that beer justice, being that our own regional water is extremely hard.  Reverse Osmosis gives us flexibility and allows us to properly pay respect and more accurately replicate brewing traditions from all over the world.\r\n \r\nOur brewing system also wouldn\u2019t be complete without putting thought into the storage of our beer. Many fantastic beers leave breweries and then suffer the consequences of entering the distribution chain that wasn\u2019t at all designed to deal with craft beer.

Rogue closed its Ashland operation in 1997, after the great flood destroyed the place. In 1991, the 15bbl system, named Howard after John Maier's former boss, from the Newport brewpub was transferred across the bay to the current brewery and upgraded to a 30bbl system. In 1998 Rogue bought a 50bbl brewsystem, named Kobe. Kobe is the only brewsystem in use. Tours: We offer brewery tours every day at 3 pm (followed by a distillery tour at 4pm).

After returning to the states, they had trouble finding that type of beer in Chicago so they opened Two Brothers Brewing Company in 1996. To get them started, the brothers' grandfather, a retired dairy farmer, donated his bulk milk tanks, which were quickly converted to fermenters. Currently, the brewery resides in a 40,000 square foot facility 30 miles west of Chicago. In addition to their traditional style beers, Two Brothers Brewing Company produces many specialty beers including the Project Opus Sour series. Adjacent to the brewery, Two Brothers Tap House opened in 2008 as a restaurant which serves elevated, seasonal, and organic American pub fare. In 2011, the Ebel brothers purchased Walter Payton's Roundhouse located in Aurora, IL. The Two Brothers Roundhouse is a full service brewpub restaurant, music venue, offers banquet space for large parties and weddings and hosts the Two Brothers Cafe and Beer Bar! \r\n\r\nTwo Brothers Brewing Company's award winning products are currently available in Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Florida, New York, Iowa and Missouri.","website":"http:\/\/www.TwoBrothersBrewing.com\/","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Cu5xXG\/upload_FFc22Y-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Cu5xXG\/upload_FFc22Y-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Cu5xXG\/upload_FFc22Y-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Cu5xXG\/upload_FFc22Y-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Cu5xXG\/upload_FFc22Y-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:01:21","locations":[{"id":"jeOXxz","name":"Two Brothers Tap House","streetAddress":"30 w 315 Calumet Ave.","locality":"Warrenville","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60555","phone":"630.393.2337","website":"http:\/\/www.twobrotherstaphouse.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday        3:00 - 11:00\r\nTuesday        3:00 - 11:00\r\nWednesday   3:00 - 11:00\r\nThursday      3:00 - 11:00\r\nFriday         12:00 - 12:00\r\nSaturday     12:00 - 12:00\r\nSunday        12:00 - 9:00","latitude":41.824453,"longitude":-88.212512,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2015-07-14 13:53:02","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"YOdPoo","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"30W315 Calumet Ave.","locality":"Warrenville","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60555","website":"http:\/\/www.twobrosbrew.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"We are give tours EVERY Saturday at 1:00 and 2:30 and Sunday at 1:00.","latitude":41.824906,"longitude":-88.211221,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2012-01-26 12:57:18","updateDate":"2015-07-07 21:22:36","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"AiMDyF","name":"Two Brothers Roundhouse","streetAddress":"205 N.
