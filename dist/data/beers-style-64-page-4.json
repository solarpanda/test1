In 1929 the dairy closed, so the brewery was able to expand production into other types of beers: Bock, Export, Pilsner and Stout Ale. In 1950 they established their first bottling plant. Up until then the beer was only being sold in kegs. Between 1968 and 1990 they've been expanding by taking over breweries in the south of the Netherlands and North of France. In the 1990's they've started modernising the brewery. In 2010 this modernisation process was completed when they inaugurated their new kegigng hall. They're currently the third biggest pilsner brewery in Belgium.","website":"http:\/\/www.haacht.com\/","established":"1898","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Fm39JC\/upload_Y4hZtk-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Fm39JC\/upload_Y4hZtk-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Fm39JC\/upload_Y4hZtk-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Fm39JC\/upload_Y4hZtk-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Fm39JC\/upload_Y4hZtk-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-11-02 10:30:52","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:38:36","locations":[{"id":"jfaN0S","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Provinciesteenweg 28","region":"Boortmeerbeek","postalCode":"3190","website":"http:\/\/www.haacht.com\/","latitude":50.965154,"longitude":4.60969,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"BE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-11-02 10:53:27","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"BE","name":"BELGIUM","displayName":"Belgium","isoThree":"BEL","numberCode":56,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Wkwlee","name":"Golden Dragon","nameDisplay":"Golden Dragon","description":"Maple Syrup Flavor","styleId":64,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-09-17 21:38:07","updateDate":"2015-09-17 21:38:07","style":{"id":64,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Dark Strong Ale","shortName":"Belgian Dark Strong","description":"Belgian dark strong ales are amber to dark brown in color.

When he wasn\u2019t busy handcrafting smoked summer sausage and pepperoni at the deli he was handcrafting small batches of beer.  Dick built from scratch a three barrel brew house (which we still use today as our pilot system) to start designing and creating recipes in the back of the deli. The beer was so popular among Dick\u2019s friends that he soon found himself exceeding the annual production limit for homebrewers.  In 1992 Dick decided to make his hobby a business and started the application and permit process to create Dick\u2019s Brewing Company.  After two years and many batches brewed, and many beers drank, Dick\u2019s Brewing Company became a reality.\r\n\r\nDick quickly realized he would need more space for his growing passion and built a 2,100 square foot building adjacent to the deli.  He started with the three barrel system and would brew once a week yielding 6 kegs.  Initially he focused solely on three beers: Pale, Porter and Dick Danger.  Dick Danger Ale, is still our best selling beer to date.  When asked why he started the brewery Dick always answered, and I quote, \u201cI started brewing beer for one reason, I was thirsty\u201d.   And we are all so grateful he was.\r\n\r\nThe brewery was located behind the Deli on Prather Road from 1995 to 2008.  Over those 13 years the brewery grew from 200 bbls in sales in one state to over 3000 bbls in 6 states.   New uni tanks and bright tanks were added along with a brand new bottling line to keep up with demand, and Dicks creative passion for brewing also grew, starting with three recipes in 1994 to over twenty different styles in 2009.  Life was good and  Dick\u2019s Beers were flying out the door.\r\nIn 2006 Dick set his sights even higher, and he started construction on a new brewing facility. After two long years of work  we moved into the brand new 18000 square foot brewing facility on Galvin Road in Centralia.\r\n\r\nDick wore many hats and he was so many things to so many people.  In 2009 we lost a brewmaster, a friend, a dad, a partner, a son, a teacher, a rebel, an electrician, a plumber, a carpenter, a craftsman, a joker, a complete and unique leader.  He will always be remembered and by doing so his vision and his dream will forever live on in every bottle or keg that gets shipped from the warehouse to someone that is thirsty.\r\n\r\nToday, the Dick\u2019s Brew Crew is led by Dick\u2019s daughter, Julie Young.  With the new brewing facility producing 23 different styles and with plenty of room for growth, we feel that the sky is the limit when it comes to Dick\u2019s legacy.  All of us here at Dick\u2019s are proud to continue the dream that our founder started, and we are proud to have you all along for the ride.","website":"http:\/\/dicksbeer.com\/","established":"1984","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/GC3a1f\/upload_tiILgV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/GC3a1f\/upload_tiILgV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/GC3a1f\/upload_tiILgV-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/GC3a1f\/upload_tiILgV-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/GC3a1f\/upload_tiILgV-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:44:31","locations":[{"id":"TkT8Rc","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"5945 Prather Road","locality":"Centralia","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98531","phone":"800-586-7760","website":"http:\/\/dicksbeer.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Fridays 3pm - 7pm","latitude":46.771347,"longitude":-123.007543,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1984","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:52","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"fAiQPx","name":"Grand Cru","nameDisplay":"Grand Cru","description":"Grand Cru is our very special Belgian-style dark ale.

With the more recent additions of David Vohden and Cameron Moore, we have refocused our efforts on producing and sharing a constantly changing lineup of fresh quality beers from right here in the Great Pacific Northwest. Vohden oversees all brewery operations which he has met with great success. Most recently of which was a Silver Medal for our Woozy Weizenbock at the Great American Beer Festival. We see our recent efforts bringing exciting results.\r\n\r\nWe reached completion of a 3,500 sq ft. addition to expand our brew house in the Summer of 2013. Vohden and Moore finished installation of the glycol system just in time to quench the thirsty demands of the 2013 Oregon Brewers Festival with a crowd pleasing Traverse Cherry Wit Bier. In addition to the brew house expansion we have added four 7-barrel fermentation tanks for an eventual all around 7-barrel system upgrade. A Cellar was also added for barrel aging, sours, and other delectable experiments.\r\n\r\nAlthough most of the square footage was utilized for brewing purposes. We were sure to save some space for all you beer drinkers. A mezzanine gives an elevated view down onto the open brewery floor. If you happen to drop by on a brew day you too can enjoy the sweet sensory overload and watch the action (or lack thereof). A beautiful black walnut bar, fully stocked with 13 drafts faucets was added to accompany the additional seating area and to cater to private events. However, the new bar and brewery seating are always open to patrons except in the case of private events. Another 60\u2032 TV was added to the new mezzanine area and we continue to play all major sporting events.

To this beer\u2019s subtle marriage of malts, dark candi sugar, local wildflower honey and zing of orange peel, we added tart dried whole Montmorency cherries from Michigan. Around this, we wrapped a barrel of charred American bourbon oak. The sugar of the cherries began to ferment away. The barrels hissed. And we waited.\r\nSix months later, the beer emerged with a glowing red color, vibrant acidity, complex fruit aromatics, and a foundation of oak flavors, its strength moving past 10%. Its transformation almost complete, the beer joined priming sugar, Champagne yeast and wild Brettanomyces yeasts in the bottle and underwent a third fermentation. And we waited yet again.\r\nNow, a full year after we brewed it, this beer is ready for your table. K is for Kriek is dry, fruity, tart, full-bodied, and expansive, able to be enjoyed now or after years of cellaring. This beer is wondrous with poultry, duck and pork dishes, tremendous with goat cheeses, and a fine pairing for desserts.

Its award-winning roster of year round, season and specialty products have gained the Brewery notoriety as one of the top craft beer producers in the world. Brooklyn beers are currently distributed in 25 states and 17 countries, and throughout 2011 the brewery underwent an expansion that will double overall capacity by 2013. In addition to facilitating community meetings at its event space, brewery employees serve on not-for-profit boards, including the Prospect Park Alliance, the Open Space Alliance, Transportation Alternatives and the Brooklyn Historical Society. Each year the company supports many charitable and arts organizations including BAM, Brooklyn Museum and MoMA, and partners with food purveyors across the country to produce beer dinners and tasting events.
