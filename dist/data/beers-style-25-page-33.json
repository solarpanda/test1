Meantime London Pale Ale continues that tradition by combining lots of American Cascade and Centennial hops to give it a complex citrus aroma and buckets full of local Kentish Goldings to provide the bitterness that makes the style so refreshing. Together they conspire to assail the nose with a complex, heady mix of  spearmint, grass and \u2018hop sack\u2019 aromas, fruity citrus flavours and a bitter finish that makes pale ale drinking a truly rewarding experience. \r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/www.meantimebrewing.com\/our-beers\/beer\/london-pale-ale\/","abv":"4.3","glasswareId":5,"availableId":1,"styleId":25,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/mq5eyY\/upload_qOp6zL-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/mq5eyY\/upload_qOp6zL-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/mq5eyY\/upload_qOp6zL-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"Roast Duck","createDate":"2015-08-03 18:37:30","updateDate":"2016-04-22 14:31:07","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":25,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"American Pale","description":"American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.

We've worked hard and are incredibly proud of the many successes we've enjoyed over the years. The Boston Beer Company has been cited as one of the best companies to work for by Boston Magazine, one of the Best Entry-Level Jobs by The Princeton Review, and our beers have won more awards than any other in history. Jim has been named an \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" by Inc. Magazine. Our brewers keep amazing us with innovative new brews, including Samuel Adams Utopias and our Samuel Adams Barrel Room Collection.\r\n\r\nJim has believed from the beginning that the more you know and understand about beer, the more you'll appreciate a beer like Samuel Adams Boston Lager. To begin that mission, all new employees go through intensive training on everything from ingredients, brewing, and beer styles, to taking care of the beer once it leaves the brewery. We're all beer lovers and protectors of the beer so we're trained how to identify off flavors and how to troubleshoot the causes. The passion for beer continues with an annual homebrew competition that we all take part in.\r\n\r\nOne of our wholesalers once asked Jim why he invested so much in training his people, when ultimately they might leave. Jim smiled and replied without hesitation: \"What if I didn't train them, and they stayed?\"\r\n\r\nEach year, usually in January, everyone gathers together. One of the highlights of the meeting is the beer trivia contest. With a culture so steeped in beer education and knowledge, winning is a pretty big deal. Recently, one of the hotel bartenders who was watching as the various teams arrived in costume with music and much enthusiasm and fanfare, said, \"I've always known Samuel Adams made the best beer in America, but now I see this is the greatest company in America.\" When you look around you see that The Boston Beer Company is a team of enthusiastic people who are passionate about beer and who really love coming to work every day to provide American drinkers with the best beer possible.\r\n\r\nThe Boston Beer Company, Inc. is a publicly-traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol, SAM.","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","established":"1984","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:24:45","locations":[{"id":"DF5YsC","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"30 Germania Street","locality":"Boston","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"02130","phone":"1-800-372-1131","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","latitude":42.314449,"longitude":-71.103365,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1984","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2015-12-02 19:22:03","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"MLUbXI","name":"Cincinnati","streetAddress":"1625 Central Parkway","locality":"Cincinnati","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45214","phone":"513-412-3200","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","latitude":39.1144986,"longitude":-84.5222061,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-12 13:10:57","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"XZ6L8a","name":"Production Brewery","streetAddress":"7880 Penn Drive","locality":"Breinigsville","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"18031","latitude":40.5759622,"longitude":-75.6290377,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2007","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-11-30 20:24:56","updateDate":"2015-12-02 19:22:03","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"hNLsQY","name":"Lookout Pale Ale","nameDisplay":"Lookout Pale Ale","description":"Lookout is a refreshing American Pale Ale with an orange blossom hop character and a clean malt body.

This historical perspective is maintained at the tavern where commerce is held equal to community. Both being Rapid City natives, Karl Koth and Sam Papendick are the owners and brewers at Hay Camp Brewing Company. After graduating from Stevens High School, Karl moved to Minneapolis to earn a degree in Physics and Sam moved to Fort Collins to earn a degree in Chemical and Biological Engineering (interesting how both locations are craft beer meccas). After receiving their bachelors degrees, they were reacquainted when pursuing graduate degrees from South Dakota School of Mines and Technology.\r\nOne evening at a local Rapid City ale house, they began talking about beer and homebrewing. Sam had a great garage and Karl had nearly 10 years brewing experience, so they began brewing beer in Sam's garage almost weekly. Equipment was accumulated, techniques were shared, and plenty of free beer was available for their friends. Karl was finishing his M.S. in Geological Engineering and Sam was in the middle of his Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering when they decided to go legitimate. The LLC was formed in August 2012 and they entered the Student Governors Giant Vision Award contest, where they placed third, winning $2500.\r\nIt took nearly a year to find a suitable location, but they finally settled on an unused and beat up garage at the Fairmont Creamery (current location). After six months of renovation, the tavern opened January 1, 2014. The beginning was modest, with a 1.5 bbl brewehouse, a 42 gal Blichman fermenter, and two 1.5 bbl single walled fermenters, but their limited time and production complemented their limited overhead.\r\nKarl received his Masters degree and began working at the US Geological Survey and Sam was still finishing his PhD, so the beer was brewed on the weekends and Friday was the only open night. In August 2014, two additional 3 BBL jacketed fermenters were installed, essentially tripling their production capacity. In January 2015, Hay Camp opened on Thursday nights, where they collaborate with Black Hills Vinyl for live music and bingo.\r\nThe patio opened spring 2015, which expanded seating capacity and overall fun. Patrons could play corn hole, country bucket, or just soak up the nice summer sun. In July 2015, they ordered a new 3 BBL brewhouse and expect the delivery late fall.\r\nLong term, Hay Camp Brewing Company will remain true to it's Rapid City roots. The current plan is to move toward a 10 BBL production brewery and begin distributing to local drafts. Growth is iterative, however, so stay tuned for adaptation post perturbation.","website":"http:\/\/www.haycampbrewing.com\/index.html","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-07-14 14:51:47","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:13:39","locations":[{"id":"Za6Nem","name":"Hay Camp Brewing Co","streetAddress":"201 Main St","locality":"Rapid City","region":"South Dakota","postalCode":"57701","phone":"(970) 215 9859","website":"http:\/\/www.haycampbrewing.com\/index.html","latitude":44.079643,"longitude":-103.2200919,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-09-24 18:07:31","updateDate":"2015-11-20 15:50:05","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Ptumjo","name":"Lord Chesterfield Ale","nameDisplay":"Lord Chesterfield Ale","description":"One of our distinct classic beers brewed since 1829, Yuengling Lord Chesterfield Ale has as much rich heritage as it does flavor and appeal.

It is typical for us to offer over twenty different Elysian beers between the three locations.","website":"http:\/\/www.elysianbrewing.com\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/hvWfx5\/upload_Ml4tjJ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/hvWfx5\/upload_Ml4tjJ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/hvWfx5\/upload_Ml4tjJ-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/hvWfx5\/upload_Ml4tjJ-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/hvWfx5\/upload_Ml4tjJ-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:07:42","locations":[{"id":"QbZbCr","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1221 East Pike Street","locality":"Seattle","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98122","phone":"206-860-3977","website":"http:\/\/www.elysianbrewing.com\/","latitude":47.614033,"longitude":-122.315716,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"7S4DH1","name":"TangleTown","streetAddress":"2106 N 55th St, Seattle, WA 98103","locality":"Seattle","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98103","phone":"206-547-5929","website":"http:\/\/www.elysianbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"M-F: Opens 11:30AM\r\nSat:  11AM - 11PM\r\nSun. 11AM - 10PM","latitude":47.668918,"longitude":-122.333473,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:14","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"p2YiVw","name":"Lost 40 Pale Ale","nameDisplay":"Lost 40 Pale Ale","abv":"5.4","ibu":"47","styleId":25,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-12-31 23:47:59","updateDate":"2015-02-02 22:43:59","style":{"id":25,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"American Pale","description":"American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.

This hop is noticeably less aromatic than most American or Southern Hemisphere cross-breeds. For comparison, this beer was made with exactly the same amount of hops as the previous beer in the series, Simcoe. As far as the beer's style, we're using a more traditional single-hop process for these new German hops. Since they are brand new, the malt bill will be exactly the same for this beer and the next two (Hull Melon and Hallertau Blanc) to allow people to taste the difference between the hops.

All of our beer produced in 2012 will include at least 25% organic, locally-malted grain with the eventual goal of improving to 100%. \r\n\r\nBrewmaster Jack is proud to have our beer produced at Paper City Brewery in Holyoke, Massachusetts.","website":"http:\/\/www.brewmasterjack.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/khl03j\/upload_nn1fNs-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/khl03j\/upload_nn1fNs-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/khl03j\/upload_nn1fNs-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/khl03j\/upload_nn1fNs-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/khl03j\/upload_nn1fNs-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-04-17 19:06:48","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:29:05","locations":[{"id":"Qi0V9u","name":"Paper City Brewery Company","streetAddress":"108 Cabot St","locality":"Holyoke","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"01040","phone":"413-367-7190","website":"http:\/\/www.brewmasterjack.com\/index.html","latitude":42.2011759,"longitude":-72.610427,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-10-01 18:49:41","updateDate":"2014-10-01 18:49:41","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"oXYk6Y","name":"Mango Ginger Pale Ale","nameDisplay":"Mango Ginger Pale Ale","abv":"5.8","styleId":25,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/oXYk6Y\/upload_Zrxw1i-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/oXYk6Y\/upload_Zrxw1i-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/oXYk6Y\/upload_Zrxw1i-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-04-17 12:25:30","updateDate":"2015-12-17 12:16:18","style":{"id":25,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"American Pale","description":"American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.

In the mountains of Tennessee gathered a very small group of friends and family including Jason\u2019s cousin Kymberly and her then boyfriend Jamie Robinson. After an intimate ceremony, the entire group enjoyed a reception complete with homemade guacamole and a tub full of crudely marked \u201chomebrews\u201d prepared by Jason. Prior to this, he had been working in high-end restaurants as a general manager, bartender and food server for over 20 years. He spent several years in Northern California learning the fine art of winemaking at a local winery in Sonoma. During this time Jason realized the beauty of brewing beer and his desire to share his creation(s) with others. He\u2019s been brewing out of his kitchen sink for several years now, slowly perfecting his recipes, offering to teach others the art, and, most importantly, making and drinking some real good beer. Jamie, who has yet to find a brew he will not try, immediately was interested in Jason\u2019s creations and quickly started picking his brain on the processes and formalities for creating these \u201chomebrews\u201d. While sucking down a few well-crafted brews in the hot sun, Jamie and Jason talked about their love of beer and the groundwork was laid.\r\n\r\nA few months later, Jamie received a phone call from Jason, who had been mulling over the possibility of moving forward with the beer making, he then proposed the idea of moving to Pennsylvania. Jason asked if Jamie would be interested in working together and the dream of opening a brewery was declared. In 2007, Jason and his wife moved to West Chester, PA where many of his family live. Together with the other three members the idea was hatched to get serious and start brewing beer on a larger scale, for the beer lovers in Chester County, PA. Box Car Brewing Company became a reality.","website":"http:\/\/www.boxcarbrewingcompany.com\/","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/PgnRc3\/upload_xOutrc-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/PgnRc3\/upload_xOutrc-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/PgnRc3\/upload_xOutrc-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/PgnRc3\/upload_xOutrc-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/PgnRc3\/upload_xOutrc-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:17:53","locations":[{"id":"0k2SXz","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"306 Westtown Rd","locality":"West Chester","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"19382","phone":"484-887-0538","website":"http:\/\/www.boxcarbrewingcompany.com\/","latitude":39.9620632,"longitude":-75.5888196,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"R7F2Wm","name":"Mango Habanero Pale Ale","nameDisplay":"Mango Habanero Pale Ale","styleId":25,"isOrganic":"Y","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-05-11 14:35:39","updateDate":"2015-05-11 14:35:39","style":{"id":25,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"American Pale","description":"American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.
