The first beers brewed by the brothers were designed to be a departure from the fairly bleak craft brewing scene in the region. Nick and Simon brewed intense balanced beers that were and still remain \u201cnot normal\u201d by conventional standards.\r\n\r\nIn November of 2005, after receiving numerous visitors to the brewery over the years, Three Floyds opened its own brewpub at the production facility.

This was the second business venture for Corcoran whom had been making award winning wines since 2004. Corcoran which is family owned and operated decided in 2011 to branch out into the hand crafted beer industry. Initially started in a barn on old farmland near Corcoran Vineyards, this combination became Virginia\u2019s first vineyard \/ brewery combo in the state. After several years of growing business it was realized that there was not enough room to stay as demand for the beer grew. In early 2014 the brewery was moved to Purcellville Virginia which is about 6 miles from where it started.\r\n\r\nCorcoran Brewing Company has produced over thirty three distinct beers since opening day. We strive to create both traditional beer types as well as creating unique experiences with experimental beers. On any given day we have twelve beers on tap ranging from Kolch style, American Pale Ales, IPA\u2019s, Imperial IPA\u2019s, Stouts, Bourbon barrel aged, port barrel aged and more. This daily broad selection of quality hand-made craft beers has been a primary reason for our success. Customers can always find a beer that meets their drinking style.","website":"http:\/\/www.corcoranbrewing.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Z7U3KK\/upload_DVPTNR-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Z7U3KK\/upload_DVPTNR-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Z7U3KK\/upload_DVPTNR-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Z7U3KK\/upload_DVPTNR-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Z7U3KK\/upload_DVPTNR-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:14:21","locations":[{"id":"G7WXOq","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"205 Hirst Rd, Suite 105","locality":"Purcellville","region":"Virginia","postalCode":"20132","phone":"540-441-3102","website":"http:\/\/www.corcoranbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Wed:  3:00pm - 9:00pm\r\nThu:  3:00am - 9:00pm\r\nFri:  12:00pm - 10:00pm\r\nSat:  12:00pm - 10:00pm\r\nSun:  12:00pm - 6:00pm","latitude":39.143536,"longitude":-77.712861,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2015-06-09 18:47:13","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"n4eMMR","name":"Easy Street Shuffle","nameDisplay":"Easy Street Shuffle","description":"Creamy wheat with clove, vanilla, and banana.","abv":"5.3","ibu":"15","styleId":48,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-04-19 12:59:37","updateDate":"2015-04-19 12:59:37","style":{"id":48,"categoryId":4,"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"South German-Style Hefeweizen \/ Hefeweissbier","shortName":"Hefeweizen","description":"The aroma and flavor of a Weissbier with yeast is decidedly fruity and phenolic.

After returning to the states, they had trouble finding that type of beer in Chicago so they opened Two Brothers Brewing Company in 1996. To get them started, the brothers' grandfather, a retired dairy farmer, donated his bulk milk tanks, which were quickly converted to fermenters. Currently, the brewery resides in a 40,000 square foot facility 30 miles west of Chicago. In addition to their traditional style beers, Two Brothers Brewing Company produces many specialty beers including the Project Opus Sour series. Adjacent to the brewery, Two Brothers Tap House opened in 2008 as a restaurant which serves elevated, seasonal, and organic American pub fare. In 2011, the Ebel brothers purchased Walter Payton's Roundhouse located in Aurora, IL. The Two Brothers Roundhouse is a full service brewpub restaurant, music venue, offers banquet space for large parties and weddings and hosts the Two Brothers Cafe and Beer Bar! \r\n\r\nTwo Brothers Brewing Company's award winning products are currently available in Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Florida, New York, Iowa and Missouri.","website":"http:\/\/www.TwoBrothersBrewing.com\/","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Cu5xXG\/upload_FFc22Y-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Cu5xXG\/upload_FFc22Y-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Cu5xXG\/upload_FFc22Y-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Cu5xXG\/upload_FFc22Y-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Cu5xXG\/upload_FFc22Y-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:01:21","locations":[{"id":"jeOXxz","name":"Two Brothers Tap House","streetAddress":"30 w 315 Calumet Ave.","locality":"Warrenville","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60555","phone":"630.393.2337","website":"http:\/\/www.twobrotherstaphouse.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday        3:00 - 11:00\r\nTuesday        3:00 - 11:00\r\nWednesday   3:00 - 11:00\r\nThursday      3:00 - 11:00\r\nFriday         12:00 - 12:00\r\nSaturday     12:00 - 12:00\r\nSunday        12:00 - 9:00","latitude":41.824453,"longitude":-88.212512,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:11","updateDate":"2015-07-14 13:53:02","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"YOdPoo","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"30W315 Calumet Ave.","locality":"Warrenville","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60555","website":"http:\/\/www.twobrosbrew.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"We are give tours EVERY Saturday at 1:00 and 2:30 and Sunday at 1:00.","latitude":41.824906,"longitude":-88.211221,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2012-01-26 12:57:18","updateDate":"2015-07-07 21:22:36","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"AiMDyF","name":"Two Brothers Roundhouse","streetAddress":"205 N.

We have a tasting room up front where you can come in, try tasters & pints, and buy growlers (re-fillable jugs of beer).","website":"http:\/\/www.oakhillsbrewing.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/bnVj0y\/upload_Ay2OXc-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/bnVj0y\/upload_Ay2OXc-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/bnVj0y\/upload_Ay2OXc-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/bnVj0y\/upload_Ay2OXc-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/bnVj0y\/upload_Ay2OXc-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-11-07 06:06:44","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:48:16","locations":[{"id":"thFM14","name":"Oak Hills Brewing Co.","streetAddress":"12221 Poplar St #3","locality":"Hesperia","region":"California","postalCode":"92344","phone":"(760) 244-8278","website":"http:\/\/www.oakhillsbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Tap Room Hours:\r\nThursday    3pm-9pm\r\nFriday       12pm-9pm\r\nSaturday   12pm-9pm","latitude":34.4149387,"longitude":-117.3958456,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-11-07 06:13:59","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"v99asX","name":"El Hefe Negro","nameDisplay":"El Hefe Negro","styleId":48,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/v99asX\/upload_rMoE1h-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/v99asX\/upload_rMoE1h-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/v99asX\/upload_rMoE1h-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-11-13 01:25:01","updateDate":"2015-12-17 06:36:24","style":{"id":48,"categoryId":4,"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"South German-Style Hefeweizen \/ Hefeweissbier","shortName":"Hefeweizen","description":"The aroma and flavor of a Weissbier with yeast is decidedly fruity and phenolic.

As businesses continue to evolve and change in Raleigh, we wanted to bring that feeling to the local restaurant scene by offering items that no one else does.  The self-serve beer wall, The Downpour, allow patrons to sample, select, and pour their own beer.  We are importing beers from both Europe and across America to supplement our soon to be released beer line.  A collaborative effort of Matt MacNeil and Adam Hoffman, the goals of the company are simple: Great Beer, Great Food, and Great Service.\r\n\r\nLocated in the Historic CP&L Garage, the space has been renovated to bring back the industrial feel that the Powerhouse Square District deserves.  With garage doors that connect the patio to the restaurant, exposed columns, and I-beams, as well as a custom concrete bar with reclaimed wood accents, we\u2019ve blended the modern with the historic.  The industrial atmosphere has been infused with technology wherever possible. Wi-Fi tablets for tableside service, LED lighting, and of course The Downpour (our self-serve beer wall), all come together to create a space that feels both raw and unfinished, yet modern and  functional.  Come enjoy a drink with friends, cheer your favorite team to victory, or host a company event.\r\n\r\nA bar and restaurant focused on craft beer, Clouds Brewing is home to The Downpour; using RFID technology you can start a tab and pour your own beer. And the best part is you pay by the ounce, not by the pint! Feel free to try a small taste of each beer, or a pint of your favorite\u2014the choice is yours. With 10 rotating taps there is always something new to try, and with no need to buy whole pints, you can try them all! So seriously, come on down, grab a glass, and \u201cExperience the Downpour!\u201d\r\n\r\nOur bar features 40 beers on draft with 10 of those located on The Downpour.  We also offer a large selection of canned and bottled beer, ciders and mead, along with wine and liquor.","website":"http:\/\/www.cloudsbrewing.com","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/B5jTO7\/upload_cjWIhN-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/B5jTO7\/upload_cjWIhN-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/B5jTO7\/upload_cjWIhN-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/B5jTO7\/upload_cjWIhN-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/B5jTO7\/upload_cjWIhN-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-06 13:38:27","updateDate":"2016-03-17 14:20:24","locations":[{"id":"c2Ifvu","name":"Main Brewpub","streetAddress":"126 N.

The idea spread as friends tasted the unique beers, and the popularity of those early batches encouraged a dedicated team of three partners to begin working to make the dream of a local brewery a reality. Mark Seibold, JD Merryweather and Daniel Mercer spent the next two years traveling throughout the United States, Europe and Central America visiting breweries and sampling local flavors. The insight gained from entrepreneurs, brewers, biologists, operations personnel and consumers provided an invaluable basis for a serious endeavor into quality commercial brewing. By integrating this knowledge with the local, regional and national brewing trends, as well as local feedback, the trio planned the birth and growth of the yet unnamed COOP. After nearly 3 years of research, comprising thousands of man hours and dozens of test batches, COOP fashioned its identity as a steadfast professional team that holds closely a passion for bringing quality, local beer to taps and homes in Oklahoma City and beyond.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWith the help of close friends and fellow craft-beer fans, COOP was capitalized on July 15th, 2008. In less than 6 months, the COOP team; navigated the multi-layered regulatory process, secured a building lease, completed the remodel, purchased and installed a commercial brewery, obtained brewing licenses from the State of Oklahoma and the Federal Tax and Trade Bureau, created and branded original recipe beers and brewed the first full scale batches for distribution.\r\n\r\nThe outpouring of support that has come from friends of the COOP team has been overwhelming. Our sincere hope is that you \u2013 the fan of COOP Ale Works \u2013 will take pride in the beers, as if they were your own.

In addition to a strong emphasis on quality, Werner Brombach focuses above all on a targeted sales and promotion strategy with a clear brand identity, which highlights the values of the old Bavarian beer specialty and its superior quality standards.\r\n\r\nToday, Erdinger weissbier stands for wheat beer enjoyment and the Bavarian brewing tradition. The traditional brewery has established itself as the national and international market leader for weissbier. As one of Germany's largest private breweries, Erdinger Weissbr\u00e4u is among the leaders on the national German beer market.","website":"http:\/\/www.erdinger.de","established":"1886","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/m9SH4l\/upload_gwY2SS-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/m9SH4l\/upload_gwY2SS-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/m9SH4l\/upload_gwY2SS-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/m9SH4l\/upload_gwY2SS-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/m9SH4l\/upload_gwY2SS-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:55:12","locations":[{"id":"qVyAhN","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Franz-Brombach-Strae 1-20","locality":"Erding","region":"Bayern","phone":"49-(0)8122-\/-4090","latitude":48.31532,"longitude":11.89111,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"yvqMs3","name":"Erlbacher Weizen","nameDisplay":"Erlbacher Weizen","abv":"5","styleId":48,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-05-04 21:48:02","updateDate":"2016-05-04 21:48:02","style":{"id":48,"categoryId":4,"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"South German-Style Hefeweizen \/ Hefeweissbier","shortName":"Hefeweizen","description":"The aroma and flavor of a Weissbier with yeast is decidedly fruity and phenolic.
