We are just four regular guys starting a local business.\r\n\r\nOur concept is simple: Rebuild an old Cleveland brewery on the grounds of one of Cleveland's oldest beer gardens in Duck Island, a part of Cleveland's Brewery District.\r\n\r\nThe brewery will include a brewpub, located in a timber frame warehouse, built in 1915 on the site of the Silberg Brothers Beer Garden (1880-1900). Part of the beer garden area still exists, so we will also rebuild the beer garden.  The beer hall, beer garden & brewery will feel like you are walking into a 19th Century brewery.\r\n\r\nThe original Forest City Brewery operated from 1839-1880 at the location where the Hard Rock Caf\u00e9 in Cleveland now resides.  The new version will have the look and feel of the old version, with solid oak, turn of the century ice boxes, a bar made from architectural salvaged timber and beer hall tables made from salvaged wood from one of the homes (built in 1880) on the property slated for demolition.","website":"http:\/\/www.forestcitybrewery.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/YDPw1H\/upload_6WUgoz-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/YDPw1H\/upload_6WUgoz-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/YDPw1H\/upload_6WUgoz-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/YDPw1H\/upload_6WUgoz-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/YDPw1H\/upload_6WUgoz-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-06-18 19:31:23","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:11:16","locations":[{"id":"yaCaJC","name":"Forest City Brewery","locality":"Cleveland","region":"Ohio","latitude":41.49932,"longitude":-81.6943605,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-09-17 21:03:46","updateDate":"2015-11-19 21:17:36","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
