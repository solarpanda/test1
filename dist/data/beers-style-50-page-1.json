We had no idea what we started. Customers loved our beer! By 1994, we outgrew the original site (now our 100-seat brew pub) and moved up the road to a larger facility to keep up with demand.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe brew over 160,000 barrels of beer and 10,000 barrels of root beer in our state-of-the-art brewing facility. Our lagers and ales are brewed in small batches, hand-crafted by a team of dedicated workers with only the highest ideals of quality. This pride, along with our brewing process, is what creates our great brews.\r\n\r\nWe are privately owned and operated by local shareholders, many who have been with us since day one.\r\n\r\nAbita uses only the finest ingredients \u2013 British and North American malted barley, German and American yeast strains, Pacific Northwest hops and the pure artesian water of Abita Springs.\r\n\r\nIn Abita Springs, we are blessed with the purest of water. Drawn from our deep wells, our pristine water is not altered in any way.\r\n\r\nAbita Beer has no preservatives, additives or stabilizers and is cold filtered. The result is beer that is the finest and freshest tasting as proven by our loyal customers and great chefs of the south who use Abita Beer in their recipes.","website":"http:\/\/www.abita.com\/","established":"1986","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BBE5WM\/upload_6HsKvN-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BBE5WM\/upload_6HsKvN-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BBE5WM\/upload_6HsKvN-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BBE5WM\/upload_6HsKvN-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BBE5WM\/upload_6HsKvN-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:43","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:38:18","locations":[{"id":"d8IJKF","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"PO Box 1510","locality":"Abita Springs","region":"Louisiana","postalCode":"70420","phone":"800-737-2311","latitude":30.4785257,"longitude":-90.0375755,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"office","locationTypeDisplay":"Office","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1986","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:43","updateDate":"2015-12-03 19:13:14","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"PdSE1h","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"21084 Louisiana 36","locality":"Covington","region":"Louisiana","postalCode":"70433","phone":"9858933143","latitude":30.482138,"longitude":-90.055185,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-09-29 14:34:50","updateDate":"2015-12-03 19:13:30","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"1xB2B8","name":"Brewpub","streetAddress":"72011 Holly Street","locality":"Abita Springs","region":"Louisiana","postalCode":"70420","phone":"(985) 892-5837","website":"http:\/\/www.abitabrewpub.com\/","latitude":30.4787911,"longitude":-90.0392975,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2004","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-09-29 14:36:40","updateDate":"2015-12-03 19:14:30","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"ZLke7K","name":"Banana Seat","nameDisplay":"Banana Seat","abv":"8.1","ibu":"21","styleId":50,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-12-08 23:29:56","updateDate":"2014-12-10 18:25:19","style":{"id":50,"categoryId":4,"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"German-Style Leichtes Weizen \/ Weissbier","shortName":"Leichtesweizen","description":"The German word leicht means light, and as such these beers are light versions of Hefeweizen.

In Bavaria this beer would be called a Kristall-Weizen (Crystal-Wheat) because of its clarity. Dancing Trout Ale is brewed with malted wheat, pale and carmel malt, and moderately hopped using the best quality hops from Germany. Unlike its British and American counterparts, Dancing Trout Ale is brewed in the Bavarian tradition: aged a minimum of 28 days, versus 7-10 days for the average ale. This means Dancing Trout Ale is mild with no bitter aftertaste! We dedicate this beer to helping preserve Montana\u2019s trout habitat, one beer at a time. \r\n\r\n To truly appreciate Dancing Trout Ale as a year-round member of Bayern Brewing\u2019s line of fine beers, an explanation is in order. This is especially because it is possible that you may already know this beer by one or two different names. \r\n\r\n Back in 1987, this beer was known as Bayern Light Wheat Ale \u2014 the filtered version of our original Hefeweizen. In 2002, Light Wheat Ale took on the personality many beer connoisseurs came to know as Trout Slayer Ale. The beer and the name grew in popularity, especially with our outdoor and angling audience. Bayern Brewing celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2007, making it the oldest brewery operating in Montana. At that time, in order to honor our time-tested brew, we decided to change the name and the label image to best reflect Bayern Brewing's environmental company philosophy. In our search for a more appropriate name we kept coming back to Dancing Trout and Montana native artist Monte Dolack created yet another evocative image that was used for the label. Whether as a fishing term or in various spiritual expressions of music and dance, Dancing Trout has become a symbol celebrating the lifestyle embraced by Montana and the values of Bayern Brewing.","abv":"5.3","ibu":"18","availableId":7,"styleId":50,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/byjCoV\/upload_AFMrxr-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/byjCoV\/upload_AFMrxr-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/byjCoV\/upload_AFMrxr-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:03","updateDate":"2015-12-15 21:19:51","available":{"id":7,"name":"Fall","description":"Available during the fall months."},"style":{"id":50,"categoryId":4,"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"German-Style Leichtes Weizen \/ Weissbier","shortName":"Leichtesweizen","description":"The German word leicht means light, and as such these beers are light versions of Hefeweizen.

The Flat Rock Brew Cafe is home to a working 'nano-brewery' and a member of the Craft Beer Industry Association. The brewhouse itself consists of a Braumeister system, one very familiar to home brewers. German made, it provides efficiency in the brewing process and was selected for its compact design. For those who want to really explore the world of beer, we offer unique beer tasting events and brewery tours.\r\n \r\nSomething that is important to us is supporting the local community and since opening, we have been involved in many fund raising events for a number of local schools and businesses. We have also become the venue of choice for community meetings from sporting clubs to pre-schools.\r\n \r\nOur great range of wines and ciders are mostly Australian as we aim to support local producers.\r\n \r\nOur food is highly regarded and compliments our range of beverages. From share plates to weekly curry specials, there's always something for everyone including vegetarian and gluten-free options.\r\n \r\nWe truly appreciate the support you have all given us since opening and we look forward to seeing you here at Flat Rock Brew Cafe in the near future.","website":"http:\/\/www.flatrockbrewcafe.com.au\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/kxjm18\/upload_8gCmao-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/kxjm18\/upload_8gCmao-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/kxjm18\/upload_8gCmao-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/kxjm18\/upload_8gCmao-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/kxjm18\/upload_8gCmao-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-02-06 22:27:52","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:50:58","locations":[{"id":"W8Mdcy","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"290 Willoughby Road","region":"Sydney","postalCode":"2065","phone":"+61 2 9460 6696","website":"http:\/\/www.flatrockbrewcafe.com.au","hoursOfOperation":"Wed - Fri: 3:00 pm - 11:00 pm\r\nSat: 12:00 pm - 11:00 pm\r\nSun: 12:00 pm - 10:00 pm","latitude":-33.817406,"longitude":151.200852,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"AU","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-02-08 15:55:14","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"AU","name":"AUSTRALIA","displayName":"Australia","isoThree":"AUS","numberCode":36,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"4qVj9M","name":"German Weisse","nameDisplay":"German Weisse","description":"cloudy, gold, medium body, banana and clove notes","abv":"5.3","availableId":1,"styleId":50,"isOrganic":"Y","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-06-03 22:45:04","updateDate":"2015-06-03 22:45:04","available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":50,"categoryId":4,"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"German-Style Leichtes Weizen \/ Weissbier","shortName":"Leichtesweizen","description":"The German word leicht means light, and as such these beers are light versions of Hefeweizen.
