Brewer\u2019s Alley is proud to continue the long history of beer making in a town known for its deep appreciation of fine fermented spirits.\r\n\r\nBrewer\u2019s Alley was located on what is currently South Court Street. Beer Production ceased in 1901 when a large fire consumed the brewery of John Kuhn, who was the last in a long line of brewers to occupy space along the banks of Carroll Creek. For over 153 years, from the very beginning of Frederick County, Brewer\u2019s Alley was a fixture in the social and economic landscape of Frederick. Ninety-five years after leaving Frederick, Brewer\u2019s Alley is back!\r\n\r\nBrewer\u2019s Alley\u2019s location at 124 North Market Street is steeped in Frederick history. The first residents of Frederick held a lottery to raise money to build a town hall and market house on this location in 1765, which was completed in 1769. This structure served its purpose for over 100 years and was witness to the birth of Frederick as a city. The Market House spanned the Civil War, including the ransoming of the city by Confederate General Jubal Early.\r\n\r\nIn 1873, the bustling town of Frederick replaced the Market House with the \"new\" multifunctional offices, and provided space in the rear for the Frederick Farmer\u2019s Market. Later, the rear of the building was replaced by the present parking deck; the first of it\u2019s kind in town.\r\n\r\nAs the seat of city government the building was witness to Frederick\u2019s political history, and as an opera house and theatre it has been witness to much of Frederick\u2019s social and entertainment history. The building has hosted such diverse events as a Memorial Service for President McKinley in 1901, the Frederick debut of D.W. Griffith\u2019s film \"The Birth of a Nation\", and the Manhattan Opera Company\u2019s production of \"Madame Butterfly\", in 1926. It also hosted the popular American Legion fundraisers immediately after World War I, and the family pleasers the Mykle and Harden Fair Week Road Shows.\r\n\r\nBrewer\u2019s Alley has been fortunate in its efforts to preserve the elegance and glory of the old Opera House by being able to engage Salyer Studio Faux to faux decorate some of the original ceiling panels and columns in mimicked old Italian Sienna marble. The beautiful and captivating glass etching work and stained glass seen throughout the building done by Rusty and Sharon Rowland\u2019s Art in Glass Studio complements this fine craftsmanship. Their rendition of the hop vines on the brewery glass and the stain glass panels in the back dinning room was all done by hand and is a joy to behold.\r\n\r\nWe are most happy to oversee the building\u2019s latest transformation into the state-of-the-art brewery and restaurant. We hope you enjoy the history and ambiance of our location, as well as the brewery and dining experience.\r\n\r\nWe opened the doors in July of 1996 and have been serving great beers and wonderful meals to the masses ever since.","website":"http:\/\/www.brewers-alley.com","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wFeIiC\/upload_q7kWln-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wFeIiC\/upload_q7kWln-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wFeIiC\/upload_q7kWln-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wFeIiC\/upload_q7kWln-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wFeIiC\/upload_q7kWln-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:48","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:05:53","locations":[{"id":"Qs29uy","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"124 North Market Street","locality":"Frederick","region":"Maryland","postalCode":"21701","phone":"301-631-0089","website":"http:\/\/www.brewers-alley.com","latitude":39.4156043,"longitude":-77.4107676,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:48","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"RW6Da0","name":"Main Brewery","locality":"Laurel","region":"MD","postalCode":"20723","latitude":39.1426709,"longitude":-76.860565,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"restaurant","locationTypeDisplay":"Restaurant\/Ale House","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2016-03-14 17:43:05","updateDate":"2016-05-01 14:34:43","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"NnMH1X","name":"Resistentialism","nameDisplay":"Resistentialism","description":"A deceivingly crushable West Coast Double IPA with intense fruity American hop characteristics","abv":"9.5","styleId":31,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-02-15 21:51:37","updateDate":"2016-02-15 23:40:24","style":{"id":31,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ale","shortName":"Imperial IPA","description":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma.

Driven by a desire for a quality, local product that would complement and diversify the already existing pub's style and reputation, Larry and Peter knew they would have to focus on producing a high quality product if it was going to be a success.  Knowing his beer knowledge and passion for the family business in which he grew up, Larry and Peter soon brought Larry's son Andrew into the conversation.  Beginning in a consulting roll, Andrew soon decided it was time to come back into the fold and asked his father and uncle for an opportunity to rejoin the family business in a full-time position.  In the coming year as business at the pub rolled on and continued to grow, so too did the brewery project.  Moving from an idea spoken about \u201coff the clock\u201d to a plan developed in a weekly owner's meeting, Geaghan Brothers Brewing Company began to take shape.  The project received a major boost in the most unlikely of circumstances when Larry, attending a local funeral, made contact with Sarah Courtney, a woman who grew up with Larry's oldest son Thomas.  Sarah and her husband Jason had spent the past 15 years working full-time in brewpub and microbrewery settings.  Jason had progressed from homebrewer to assistant brewer to head brewer and in 2002 had a very successful showing at the Great American Beer Festival, receiving the brewpub category brewmaster of the year honors.  As Larry, Peter and Andrew continued conversations and expressed their desire to build a small-scale brewery in Bangor, Jason and Sarah also expressed their interest in moving back to the Bangor area.  In time, with many conversations and meetings, both desires began to take shape.  With many options available to them, Jason and Sarah decided an opportunity to have a foundational and long-term impact on and relationship with a truly local brewery in Bangor, Maine was exactly what they were looking for.  In December 2011 the idea became a reality.  The Geaghan Family, together with award winning brewer Jason Courtney, have begun pouring pints of locally craft brewed beer from Geaghan Brothers Brewing Company exclusively at Geaghan's Pub.","website":"http:\/\/www.geaghanspub.com","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jmyqSv\/upload_Fwpywr-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jmyqSv\/upload_Fwpywr-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jmyqSv\/upload_Fwpywr-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jmyqSv\/upload_Fwpywr-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jmyqSv\/upload_Fwpywr-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-10 18:56:21","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:42:57","locations":[{"id":"oN5ry0","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"570 Main Street","locality":"Bangor","region":"Maine","postalCode":"04401","phone":"207-945-3730","website":"http:\/\/www.geaghanspub.com","latitude":44.786998,"longitude":-68.777343,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-10 19:02:53","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"4l1717","name":"Roudy IPA","nameDisplay":"Roudy IPA","abv":"8.8","ibu":"95","styleId":31,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-09-02 20:34:27","updateDate":"2015-09-02 20:34:27","style":{"id":31,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ale","shortName":"Imperial IPA","description":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma.

Let me explain. 350 Augusta Ave. was our address in Dekalb, IL. At the time, your founders Todd and Erik spent more time on projects like way below average punk rock bands in the attic, and a Hardcore Wrestling Federation called WCVF (this took place in our kitchen), instead of focusing on classes like Humanities 227 in DuSable Hall. I mean, have you ever choke slammed one of your best friends into an oven pre-heated to \"550 degrees\"? Well i have, and that was just a random Wednesday night. This raw energy (stupidity) and creativity is what eventually drew us to the Craft Beer scene. That\u2019s what craft beer is\u2026a creative and fresh twist on a beverage that has been mass produced and shoved down our throats for much too long (carefully stepping down from soapbox). Why not name our Brewery after the point in our life when we were most creative? Well\u2026..we did. It was during these times we were also introduced to good, quality beer.\r\n\r\nOnce NIU had enough of our shenanigans, Erik went on to continue his education while I submerged myself into the cesspool known as corporate America. I feel dirty just talking about it. Over the last decade, my soul has been slowly rotting and exiting my body so there was a need for this creative juice to be squeezed once again. Since wrestling and punk rock was now out of the question, brewing beer quickly became that much needed release from the Groundhog Day that had become the norm for us. Erik like most homebrewers started out brewing with extract several years ago and quickly rose to the challenge of all-grain batches. Erik, the 350 Head brewer, has been very successful when entering brewing competitions walking away with multiple awards for his Porter and Patersbier. Myself on the other hand have had a love for flavorful craft beer for many moons, and once I learned of Erik\u2019s brewing expertise years ago, I too became emerged in this brewing lifestyle. It was a match made in heaven. Erik brewed awesome beer, and I was awesome at drinking and sharing that beer!!! \r\n\r\nFrom that point on things just sort of clicked and for the last 2 years Erik and I have been researching and concocting this master plan of opening a brewery. The time has come. We want all of you to enjoy this journey with us. Tinley Park has always been our #1 choice for the 350 Brewing Company. Downtown Tinley Park embodies the spirit of 350. With great electricity in the downtown area, coupled with an amazing artistic feel, will definitely pair well with our vision of always making sure a visit to our brewery is an interesting experience. We feel Tinley Park is ready for a neighborhood brewery. It really was an easy decision based on Tinley Park\u2019s sense of community and passion for supporting local products.\r\n\r\nWe are looking forward to joining the family of incredible Illinois Brewers. We should all thank our lucky stars that we live in a state with such high quality Breweries.","website":"http:\/\/350Brewing.com","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/W3pb09\/upload_uohtEs-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/W3pb09\/upload_uohtEs-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/W3pb09\/upload_uohtEs-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/W3pb09\/upload_uohtEs-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/W3pb09\/upload_uohtEs-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-07-25 13:35:25","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:56:23","locations":[{"id":"1mRL8J","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"7144 183rd St","locality":"Tinley Park","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60477","website":"http:\/\/350Brewing.com","latitude":41.5593734,"longitude":-87.7911748,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-07-25 13:36:01","updateDate":"2015-12-03 19:00:50","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"zmbpxy","name":"RuinTen IPA","nameDisplay":"RuinTen IPA","description":"We first released this decidedly indelicate beer in 2012, as Stone Ruination Tenth Anniversary IPA, to celebrate the 10th anniversary of our belovedly bitter Stone Ruination IPA.

They spent many long nights building brewing equipment by hand and coming up with tasty recipes.  More than twenty years later, the long nights and quest for great beer has continued, but on a much larger scale.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 2000, Cascade Lakes Brewing Company was purchased by Rick Orazetti and Doug Kutella.  Ron Kutella and Chris Justema soon joined the partnership. What started as a small brewing facility in an airport industrial zone has turned into a state-of-the-art, 25-barrel brew house system that allows brewing 775 gallons per batch, three times daily. The partners also expanded from just a brewery to having four local pubs: 7th Street Brew House, Tumalo Tavern, Cascade West Grub and Alehouse, and our flagship restaurant in Bend, Cascade Lakes Lodge. Cascade Lakes beer is now distributed and sold in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho.\r\n\r\nCascade Lakes brews six beers year-round: Blonde Bombshell, 20\u201d Brown, Paddleboard Porter, Hopsmack IPA, Mosaic IPA, and Cyclops IPA. They brew many seasonals throughout the year including: Snow Park XPA, Slippery Slope, Skookum Creek Ale, Paulina Lake Pilsner, Waste Deep Weiss, Riverside Red, Silverback Imperial Stout, Kolsch, IRA, etc. Look for our beers on draft at your favorite pub and grab a six-pack at your local grocery store.\r\n\r\nPHIL BREY \u2013 HEAD BREWER\r\nPhil brings 25 years of winemaking and brewing experience to Cascade Lakes Brewing Co. Phil started home brewing in college while working on his degree in Enology (winemaking) at Fresno State. Phil started with some winemaking stints in California at Mirassou Winery and Bogle Vineyards before moving to Bend. He began his professional brewing career at Deschutes Brewery. After some time over in the valley making wine at Benton-Lane Winery and Spindrift Cellars, and brewing at Oregon Trail Brewery, Phil returned to the High Desert to brew at Cascade Lakes, where he has worked since 2010. When Phil isn\u2019t producing some sort of alcohol, he can be found mountain biking, hiking, gardening and spending time with family.","website":"http:\/\/cascadelakes.com\/","established":"1994","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/sIBGId\/upload_2VG3hV-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/sIBGId\/upload_2VG3hV-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/sIBGId\/upload_2VG3hV-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/sIBGId\/upload_2VG3hV-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/sIBGId\/upload_2VG3hV-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:50","updateDate":"2016-06-23 18:22:00","locations":[{"id":"O2ScDy","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2141 SW First Street","locality":"Redmond","region":"Oregon","postalCode":"97756","phone":"541-923-3110","website":"http:\/\/cascadelakes.com\/","latitude":44.256031,"longitude":-121.169251,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1994","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:50","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"C7u6RO","name":"7th Street Brew House","streetAddress":"855 SW 7th Street","locality":"Redmond","region":"Oregon","postalCode":"97756","phone":"541-923-1795","website":"http:\/\/cascadelakes.com\/pubs\/7th-street\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  11:30am -

What was once office space is now a refuge for the craft beer enthusiast. With all the Three Floyds mainstays, seasonal offerings, special small batch beers and many guest beers it is a mecca for craft beer. The pub also has a full service kitchen providing pub fare of the best quality supported by a 3000 square foot organic herb and vegetable garden.","website":"http:\/\/www.3floyds.com","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/iodDki\/upload_Va4zor-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/iodDki\/upload_Va4zor-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/iodDki\/upload_Va4zor-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/iodDki\/upload_Va4zor-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/iodDki\/upload_Va4zor-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2016-01-15 16:17:52","locations":[{"id":"71LkGn","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"9750 Indiana Parkway","locality":"Munster","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"46321","phone":"1-219-922-3565","website":"http:\/\/www.threefloydspub.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nTue:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nWed:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nThu:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nFri:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nSat:  12:00pm - 2:00am\r\nSun:  12:00pm - 12:00am","latitude":41.535541,"longitude":-87.516686,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2015-06-18 14:42:36","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"GoDmMT","name":"Munster","streetAddress":"9750 Indiana Parkway","locality":"Munster","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"46321","phone":"219-922-4425","website":"http:\/\/www.3floyds.com\/","latitude":41.535536,"longitude":-87.516687,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:16","updateDate":"2015-04-01 18:55:51","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"UzRiL9","name":"Rye IPA","nameDisplay":"Rye IPA","abv":"8.5","ibu":"100","styleId":31,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-04-08 17:58:51","updateDate":"2016-05-07 16:43:19","style":{"id":31,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ale","shortName":"Imperial IPA","description":"Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma.

At the turn of the century, this neighborhood was home to nearly 45,o00 inhabitants, most of them of German descent and 38 breweries. We hope to engender the spirit of camaraderie and hard work that we imagine those living and brewing in this neighborhood at that time embodied.\r\n\r\nWe self distribute our beer, which means each beer that you drink in a bar or restaurant is poured from a keg that we delivered cold in our refrigerated van (keep your eyes peeled for it around town). We like to keep beer as fresh as possible, which means that every keg we fill is immediately moved into cold storage where it sits until we load it onto our refrigerated van for delivery to the coldbox of each local account.

Our goal is to brew world class beers and deliver them to our customers as fresh as possible making them the best beers in Texas and Louisiana. Our customers are beer lovers - people that appreciate great, full-flavored beers.\r\n\r\nOur small crew does everything at the brewery: brew the beer, filter the beer, keg the beer, bottle the beer, sell the beer and drink the beer. For us, this is a passion, not a job. We believe that this comes through in the beers we make. Our beers have soul.\r\n\r\nWe brew several different beers; some are year round, some are seasonal and a few are single batch brews. They are available in bars, restaurants, grocery stores, liquor stores and warehouse stores throughout Texas and Louisiana.\r\n\r\nOur first keg of beer was shipped on June 9, 1994. Founded by Brock Wagner and Kevin Bartol, we chose Houston because, other than living here, this was the largest city in the country that did not have a microbrewery. Brock was a longtime homebrewer and had considered opening a brewery as far back as college, although that was quickly dismissed as a silly idea. Seven years after graduating, Brock revisited the idea, enlisted Kevin's help and the brewery was off and running. Kevin has since left the business after a bitter battle. (Just kidding - but don't you wish people wrote that when it was the truth?).\r\n\r\nPlease visit us if you are in Houston.
