Always looking to take a good thing too far, we sat down and over a beer (or two) decided that beer itself was a good idea. Of course, not just some easy-drinking institutional prole beer, but stuff like the beers we'd had at great bars. We had frequented places with extensive and varied beer lists. Places with lists 180 items long, all of which we tried twice (not in one night). In short, we wanted beer with flavor. Complexity. Character. Intensity. Not words found in the mass market lexicon.\r\n\r\nSo with a banjo burner, a bunch of industrial kitchen sized pots and as many buckets as we could find, we jumped in feet first. Once a week, every week. We tried to emulate the beers we liked, but soon we were adding a little of this, or some of that and after a while we started having a hard time pegging our beer in a style category. Our first success was a Porter that was mainly porter, slightly stout. We ran it blind with our friends against the porters we liked and people liked it. \"We're on to something\", we thought. Twenty iterations, modifications and tweaks later it is Distorter, and is still our favorite beer.\r\n\r\nThis led to twice a week brewing and handing out bottle after bottle to everyone we knew. Along the way we screwed up a wheat beer by accidentally making it into sort of a copper ale with a few too many hops. And so Red Bud Ale was born. We had some extra noble hops and threw them in the IPA, and with some tinkering we most certainly had a one-of-a-kind IPA. You get the picture. All of this has firmly cemented our \"anything goes\" approach to beer making.

We have expanded into a 12,000 sq. ft., state of the art 30 barrel production facility, Edgewater, in South Downtown, Grand Junction, Colorado.","website":"http:\/\/kannahcreekbrewingco.com\/","established":"2005","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/d9U8Mi\/upload_fXOwnT-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/d9U8Mi\/upload_fXOwnT-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/d9U8Mi\/upload_fXOwnT-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/d9U8Mi\/upload_fXOwnT-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/d9U8Mi\/upload_fXOwnT-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:59","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:08:12","locations":[{"id":"eyYenc","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1960 N. 12th Street","locality":"Grand Junction","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"81501","phone":"970-263-0111","website":"http:\/\/kannahcreekbrewingco.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"SUN - THURS 11AM - 10PM\r\nFRI - SAT 11AM - 11PM\r\nPhone: 970-263-0111","latitude":39.085288,"longitude":-108.5522844,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2005","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:59","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"x2mRcs","name":"Edgewater Brewery","streetAddress":"905 Struthers Ave.","locality":"Grand Junction","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"81501","phone":"(970) 243-3659","hoursOfOperation":"Sunday-Thursday 11am-10pm \r\nFriday & Saturday 11am-11pm","latitude":39.055173,"longitude":-108.557323,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-05-19 16:13:13","updateDate":"2016-05-19 16:13:13","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"AzWoy7","name":"The Bakers' Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"The Bakers'","description":"We are a Bakery and Brewpub featuring homemade sourdough breads with awesome, creative sandwich combinations melted between slices of these delicious breads and served with hearty side dish options as well as homemade soups and freshly chopped salads.

Always looking to take a good thing too far, we sat down and over a beer (or two) decided that beer itself was a good idea. Of course, not just some easy-drinking institutional prole beer, but stuff like the beers we'd had at great bars. We had frequented places with extensive and varied beer lists. Places with lists 180 items long, all of which we tried twice (not in one night). In short, we wanted beer with flavor. Complexity. Character. Intensity. Not words found in the mass market lexicon.\r\n\r\nSo with a banjo burner, a bunch of industrial kitchen sized pots and as many buckets as we could find, we jumped in feet first. Once a week, every week. We tried to emulate the beers we liked, but soon we were adding a little of this, or some of that and after a while we started having a hard time pegging our beer in a style category. Our first success was a Porter that was mainly porter, slightly stout. We ran it blind with our friends against the porters we liked and people liked it. \"We're on to something\", we thought. Twenty iterations, modifications and tweaks later it is Distorter, and is still our favorite beer.\r\n\r\nThis led to twice a week brewing and handing out bottle after bottle to everyone we knew. Along the way we screwed up a wheat beer by accidentally making it into sort of a copper ale with a few too many hops. And so Red Bud Ale was born. We had some extra noble hops and threw them in the IPA, and with some tinkering we most certainly had a one-of-a-kind IPA. You get the picture. All of this has firmly cemented our \"anything goes\" approach to beer making. Our inability to ever get quite within the style guidelines means we may never win an award, but we're ok with that.\r\n\r\nNow, several years later and with a 90% super-cool\/10% Rube Goldberg 7 bbl version of our banjo burner and kitchen pots, we're befuddling the beer judges and converting the masses. One pint at a time.\r\n\r\nStop in the storefront and try our mainstays, seasonals and small-batch runs. Not to mention our lab beers, where we continue to screw up one thing or another in search of the next great beer.","website":"http:\/\/www.greenbushbrewing.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:19:53","locations":[{"id":"AlhRYb","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"5885 Sawyer Rd.","locality":"Sawyer","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49125","phone":"269-405-1076","website":"http:\/\/www.greenbushbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sunday - Thursday: 12-8\r\nFriday and Saturday: 12-10","latitude":41.8856286,"longitude":-86.5946671,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"2EXJKp","name":"The Strongman Ale","nameDisplay":"The Strongman Ale","abv":"8","ibu":"40","styleId":14,"isOrganic":"Y","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/2EXJKp\/upload_4n87pP-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/2EXJKp\/upload_4n87pP-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/2EXJKp\/upload_4n87pP-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-05-15 14:49:42","updateDate":"2015-12-18 17:52:17","style":{"id":14,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Strong Ale","shortName":"Strong Ale","description":"Light amber to mid-range brown in color, strong ales are medium to full bodied with a malty sweetness and may have low levels of roast malt character.

This is the spirit of Slumbrew.\r\n\r\nSlumbrew is the research & development brand and concept of Somerville Brewing Company. Our mission is to brew unique, ingredient-driven beers that challenge common notions of what a beer should taste like. It is the result of nearly 15 years of beer travel and research by Caitlin Jewell and Jeff Leiter; and a decade of Jeff\u2019s homebrewing recipe formulation.\r\n\r\nWe produce a lot of small-run, pilot beers at the Slumbrew Beerlab, but only a small number make their way to commercial production. The Somerville Brewing Company contracts with regional breweries to make the best recipes for wide-spread commercial release, but each recipe is an evolving process of refinement. This model for beer production provides an opportunity to experiment with innovative local ingredients to produce craft beers that stand apart from typical formulations.","website":"http:\/\/www.slumbrew.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gwDTjS\/upload_6jyi8Y-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gwDTjS\/upload_6jyi8Y-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gwDTjS\/upload_6jyi8Y-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gwDTjS\/upload_6jyi8Y-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gwDTjS\/upload_6jyi8Y-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-02-13 00:30:15","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:28:13","locations":[{"id":"pATY6L","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"15 Ward St.","locality":"Somerville","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"02143","phone":"1-800-428-1150","website":"http:\/\/www.slumbrew.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  11:00am - 12:00am\nTue:  11:00am - 12:00am\nWed:  11:00am - 12:00am\nThu:  11:00am - 12:00am\nFri:  11:00am - 12:00am\nSat:  11:00am - 12:00am\nSun:  11:00am - 10:00pm\n\n","latitude":42.3748173,"longitude":-71.0892732,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-02-13 00:36:08","updateDate":"2015-05-08 13:45:09","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"KmOr3n","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"15 Ward Street","locality":"Somerville","region":"MA","hoursOfOperation":"11am - 12am","latitude":42.3748173,"longitude":-71.0892732,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2015-04-29 21:38:08","updateDate":"2015-05-08 13:45:44","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"dgdVJz","name":"American Fresh Beer Garden","streetAddress":"310 Canal St.","locality":"Somerville","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"02145","phone":"1.800.428.1150","hoursOfOperation":"Tue:  11:00am - 10:00pm\nWed:  11:00am - 10:00am\nThu:  11:00am - 12:00am\nFri:  11:00am - 12:00am\nSat:  11:00am - 12:00am\nSun:  11:00am - 12:00am\n\n","latitude":42.3941311,"longitude":-71.079673,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-05-08 13:50:59","updateDate":"2015-05-08 13:50:59","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
