Today, the Hershey, PA-based brewery produces six year-round beers (Hopback Amber Ale, Troegenator Double Bock, JavaHead Stout, Tr\u00f6egs Pale Ale, DreamWeaver Wheat, and Perpetual IPA); four seasonal releases as part of the Hop Cycle series (Cultivator Helles Bock, Sunshine Pils, Hop Knife Harvest Ale, and Blizzard of Hops Winter IPA); and two limited beers (Nugget Nectar and Mad Elf Ale). \r\n\r\nIn addition to these beers, Tr\u00f6egs produces a variety of experimental, small batch beers as part of its Scratch Beer Series.

Each beer is born out of a free flowing of ideas; a collaborative exchange of concepts between intellectual thesis and recipe. This then leads to lots of pilot brewing which often leads to further discussion of concept until ultimately either the beer style is determined by the concept or vice versa. This process allows for a great amount of freedom and creativity to already be present at the beginning of every new project.","website":"http:\/\/www.rexxreserve.com\/","established":"2015","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/eepurl.com\/bb8GTP","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/oMc5DI\/upload_zQXHRG-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/oMc5DI\/upload_zQXHRG-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/oMc5DI\/upload_zQXHRG-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/oMc5DI\/upload_zQXHRG-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/oMc5DI\/upload_zQXHRG-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-05-27 17:41:08","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:09:27","locations":[{"id":"EzrIDK","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1203 New Windsor Rd.","locality":"Westminster","region":"Maryland","phone":"(410) 861-0415","latitude":39.555824,"longitude":-77.041126,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-05-28 16:38:00","updateDate":"2015-05-28 16:38:00","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"FLWMSn","name":"Seme Della Vita","nameDisplay":"Seme Della Vita","description":"Belgian-style tripel brewed with pistachios and vanilla beans","abv":"9.4","styleId":59,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-22 16:18:19","updateDate":"2015-03-22 16:18:19","style":{"id":59,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Tripel","shortName":"Belgian Tripel","description":"Tripels are often characterized by a complex, sometimes mild spicy character.

Colombian bananas, toasted coconut, Piloncillo raw cane sugar, passion fruit, mamey sapote, and fresh mangoes were all used in the process, and the elixir went through nearly half a year of aging on Venezualan rum barrels.

All the equipment was removed and brought back to Lakewood, New York and set up at its new 10,000 square foot home, The Southern Tier Brewing Company. The Brewery began operations in February 2004 distributing regionally. By 2005 sales covered the majority of the New York State and the eastern half of Pennsylvania. In the beginning their two Flagship brands were a Pilsner and Mild Ale. Oh yeah they also brewed IPA! As it turned out the flagships were a flop and the IPA was a huge success. They next launched a line of seasonal beers which have gained great success. Since the beginning, Southern Tier has experienced steady growth, currently distributing to over 25% of the United States. Multiple expansions have been made to keep up with demand and the brewery continues to be innovative by producing new products.

We opened on March 25, 2011. The restaurant serves lunch and dinner with approximately 90 seats inside plus 35 seats of outside patio dining. We offer family friendly dining with a children\u2019s play area, as well as a private meeting room for business gatherings and presentations or private events, all within full view of our own brewery.  \r\n\r\nThe restaurant is very much \u201cfarm-to-fork,\u201d working closely with North Carolina pasture raised beef farmers supplying beef with no hormones added and antibiotic-free meat that we grind daily to make our hamburgers and all-beef hotdogs.  We work with other farmers growing vegetables such as tomatoes, cucumbers for pickles, and lettuce. The menu is streamlined with most items produced on-site including house made buns, sauerkraut and bacon. We use no artificial sweeteners, no high fructose corn syrup, and no hydrogenated oils.  We like to say we are like fine dining in a burger joint.  We make the mustard, the slaw, the pickles, the mayo, the aioli, the hotdogs, the relish, the...\r\n\r\nWe are also a full scale working brewery and brew our own beer.  We have up to eight beers on-tap at any given time creating fresh ales and lagers rotating seasonally throughout the year. We use just malt, hops, yeast and water to craft our beer, leaving out adjuncts and additives. We take wine seriously and feature farmer made, estate grown and bottled wines from around the world, which are served on-tap via the Enomatic self-serve wine-dispensing machine.\r\n\r\nCentral to Bull City Burger and Brewery\u2019s core values is sustainability; our attempt is to operate while leaving the smallest energy footprint possible.  Our long term goal is to become part of a cycle of energy with the restaurant playing an integral role in the farms we source. Grain left over from the brewing process will feed locally farmed pigs that provide pork bellies to make our bacon, and the fry oil will become bio-diesel to fuel vehicles.","website":"http:\/\/www.bullcityburgerandbrewery.com\/","established":"2011","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/visitor.r20.constantcontact.com\/manage\/optin\/ea?v=001qie9IeSPzo4U1KgkEFG5EQ%3D%3D","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/eu1cAn\/upload_OCIvTW-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/eu1cAn\/upload_OCIvTW-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/eu1cAn\/upload_OCIvTW-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/eu1cAn\/upload_OCIvTW-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/eu1cAn\/upload_OCIvTW-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:12:44","locations":[{"id":"vGotFH","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"107 East Parrish Street","extendedAddress":"Suite 105","locality":"Durham","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"27701","phone":"919-680-2333","website":"http:\/\/www.bullcityburgerandbrewery.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday - Thursday: 11:11am to 10pm\r\nFriday & Saturday:  11:11am to 11pm-ish\r\nClosed Sundays","latitude":35.995445,"longitude":-78.899939,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"DL06hJ","name":"Tchuck\u00e9","nameDisplay":"Tchuck\u00e9","abv":"7","styleId":59,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-10 16:39:09","updateDate":"2015-02-10 16:39:09","style":{"id":59,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Tripel","shortName":"Belgian Tripel","description":"Tripels are often characterized by a complex, sometimes mild spicy character.

The equinox, and the intrigue of equal night and day, has deep roots in history and ritual. But, at the same time, the equinox marks the changing of the season, and forces us to look toward the future. We find it interesting that the two days out of the year that have perfect light and dark balance also show the balance between the past and the future, tradition and innovation. Beer contains similar elements. Sure, there\u2019s the balance of flavors in a beer; sweet and bitter, rich and simple\u2026\r\n\r\nWe find another aspect of beer\u2019s balancing act fascinating. Historically, beer styles have developed because of limitations in local ingredients and the necessity to make do with what you have. However, due to global trade and modern shipping methods, limitations on ingredients have been removed. We can get any ingredients we want. While most modern brewers recognize the importance of beer styles and learn from the brewers who made them, they certainly don\u2019t limit themselves to making beers that fit into traditional definitions.\r\n\r\nOn one level our beers fit into some traditional styles, but we put our own twist on them. We want our beers to capture elements from the past and incorporate new ideas, ingredients and techniques into them.

Eric and Tim quickly realized that this is an excercise in futility, but along the way, their steadfast persistence and the quest to make a truly satisfying beer has resulted in countless hours of research and experimentation. While the small 5 gallon batches allowed for plenty of great experience, they yearned for more creative control.\r\n\r\nThe brewers decided it was time for a more professional three vessel system, giving them complete control over the brewing process. The 1\/2 barrel system gave the brewers a solid platform to refine and perfect a lineup of beers for the most discerning pallet. This led to the creation of several great recipes, and a roster of clean crisp beers. The original hobby transformed into a passion for sharing world-class hand crafted beers with those who would appreciate them. \r\n\r\nLevante Brewing currently brews on our 15 bbl production brewery system located in West Chester, PA.

The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery. Goose Island beers are now enjoyed in all 50 states and Europe.","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:46:51","locations":[{"id":"S2n5TB","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1800 West Fulton Street","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60612","phone":"1-800-466-7363","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","latitude":41.887107,"longitude":-87.6720969,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:33:51","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"D2gG2C","name":"Clybourn","streetAddress":"1800 North Clybourn Avenue","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60614","phone":"800-466-7363","latitude":41.9137242,"longitude":-87.65373,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1988","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:32:55","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
