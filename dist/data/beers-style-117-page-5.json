In 2015 a vacant Rock Hill, SC car dealership was purchased and converted into a craft brewery and brewpub.  With over 11,000 square feet of space, the brewpub houses a 17-barrel brewing system along with two smaller brewing systems which can collectively produce 10,000 barrels of beer per year. Legal Remedy Brewing beers, including Alibi Ale, Witness White IPA, Sequestered Saison and Pro Bono Porter are presently served at the brewpub alongside food that is just as crafty as the beer.

Way back in 1988, Luch Scremin was a Freshman in college and became interested in brewing his own beer.  Since the internet did not exist, Luch was forced to order a \u201cbeer kit\u201d from an ad in the back of an issue of Popular Mechanics.  Suffice it to say that what resulted was indeed beer but was far from great.\r\n\r\nFast forward twenty years and the love of beer and the desire to brew it had matured over years of home brewing and an insatiable appetite for delicious brew.  Luch traveled the world with his job in the airline business and was treated to many delicious beer styles and beer culture.  In 2008 while planning to open a beer bar and brewpub,  Luch met his future business partners Andy and Sean.  The three were soon making the business a reality.\r\n\r\nAll that was left was a name.  They soon decided they would name the brewery for Luch\u2019s 1962 Ford Fire Engine \u2013 after all, they just don\u2019t make them like that anymore.  It represents all that Engine 15 Brewing Co. is about. Camaraderie, old school know how, determination and a simple but serious dedication to the cause.\r\nAs of 2011, Engine 15 Brewing Co. has enjoyed success and was even voted best Pub and Brewpub  in Jacksonville by the Folio Weekly readers poll.  At Engine 15 Brewing Co. you\u2019ll find a friendly atmosphere where you can enjoy a dizzying array of beers, both brewed in house and imported from the far reaches of the globe, eat a tasty meal and even brew your own beer!\r\n\r\nEngine 15 \u2013 Eat, Drink, Brew!","website":"http:\/\/www.engine15.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/VajTuz\/upload_NgL0g3-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/VajTuz\/upload_NgL0g3-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/VajTuz\/upload_NgL0g3-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/VajTuz\/upload_NgL0g3-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/VajTuz\/upload_NgL0g3-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:18:54","locations":[{"id":"E6WUse","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1500 Beach Blvd","locality":"Jacksonville Beach","region":"Florida","postalCode":"32250","phone":"904-249-2337","website":"http:\/\/www.engine15.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Tue - Thu: 11:00 am - 11:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:00 am - 12:00 am\r\nSun: 11:00 am - 11:00 pm","latitude":30.287586,"longitude":-81.4081999,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"BluMDo","name":"Route des Epices","nameDisplay":"Route des Epices","description":"Peppercorn rye beer.","abv":"5.3","styleId":117,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/BluMDo\/upload_4az2Oc-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/BluMDo\/upload_4az2Oc-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/BluMDo\/upload_4az2Oc-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-03-18 20:03:21","updateDate":"2015-12-18 00:18:25","style":{"id":117,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Rye Ale or Lager with or without Yeast","shortName":"Rye Ale","description":"Rye beers can be made using either ale or lager yeast.

Wachusett Country Ale was introduced to beer fans of Massachusetts the next year after lots of experimenting to get the formula just right. When Wachusett opened, the three designed and built most of the equipment; did the brewing and filling, selling and delivering, and everything else that a small startup brewery needed.

It should be brewed with at least 20 percent rye malt, and low to medium perception of hop bitterness. Hop aroma and flavor can be low to medium-high. These are often versions of classic styles that contain noticeable rye character in balance with other qualities of the beer. A spicy, fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels; however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is straw to amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. If this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. A low level of tannin derived astringency may be perceived. If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa\/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor\/aroma profile. As in the lighter colored versions, diacetyl should not be perceived. Competition directors may create specific styles of rye beer, such as Rye Pale Ale or Rye Brown Ale. A statement by the brewer indicating if the beer is based on a classic style is essential for accurate judging.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:44:12"},"breweries":[{"id":"g0FV6B","name":"Round Guys Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Round Guys","description":"Round Guys Brewing Company, located in Lansdale, PA, developed from the ghastly mind of chief Round Guy and head brewer, Scott Rudich.
