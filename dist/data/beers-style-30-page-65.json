All for his love of beer.\r\n\r\nIt wasn\u2019t a side effect of empty-nest syndrome or a midlife crisis. Janet, who endured her husband\u2019s brewing experiments in her kitchen for years, finally banned Gerald\u2019s brewing operations to the garage where he set up a larger operation and brewed the first of his award winning home brews. Realizing Gerald had a great talent, the couple decided to open a microbrewery in nearby Hays.\r\n\r\nThe Wymans planned to open their microbewery in a strip mall.

By the end of the 19th-Century the brewery would be one of the largest in the United States. The brewery closed its doors when Prohibition began in 1919. The brand was revived in 1981 as one of the pioneer craft beers of todays craft beer movement, with the introduction of a series of Christian Moerlein beers by the Hudepohl Brewing Company. In 1984, Christian Moerlein Lager was the first American beer ever certified by the German government to pass the German Beer Purity Law (Reinheitsgebot). After a series of sales that took the business and brewing out of the region, the company was relocated once again to Cincinnati in 2004 by Gregory Hardman, its current local owner. With the goal of returning Cincinnati's grand brewing traditions, Hardman led the effort to build a world-class Moerlein Lager House brewery\/gastropub on the banks of the Ohio River which opened in 2012 in Cincinnati's Smale Riverfront Park next to Great American Ballpark, home of the Cincinnati Reds. A spectacular craft brewing facility and Malt House Taproom opened in 2013 in the historic Over-the-Rhine brewery district, just blocks from its original 19th century home. The brewery offers tours and has a taproom in an original 1860's malt house complete with historic underground lagering cellars. The brewery is the first American craft brewer to rescue a City's heritage beer brands and owns Hudepohl-Schoenling Brewing Co. including the brands of Hudepohl, Hudy Delight, Hudy 14-K, Burger and Little Kings Cream Ale brands.","website":"http:\/\/www.christianmoerlein.com\/","established":"1853","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Em1uno\/upload_DkG1sa-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Em1uno\/upload_DkG1sa-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Em1uno\/upload_DkG1sa-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Em1uno\/upload_DkG1sa-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Em1uno\/upload_DkG1sa-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:50","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:11:17","locations":[{"id":"qo6LCf","name":"Main Brewery, General Offices and Taproom","streetAddress":"1621 Moore St.","locality":"Cincinnati","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45202","phone":"513-827-6025","website":"http:\/\/www.christianmoerlein.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Wed:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\nThu:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\nFri:  4:00pm - 12:00am\nSat:  12:00pm - 12:00am\nSun:  12:00pm - 7:00pm\n\n","latitude":39.1137948,"longitude":-84.5150108,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1853","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:50","updateDate":"2014-12-15 02:45:48","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"X0HMO8","name":"Christian Moerlein Lager House","streetAddress":"115 Joe Nuxhall Way","locality":"Cincinnati","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45202","phone":"513-421-2337","website":"http:\/\/www.moerleinlagerhouse.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  1:00pm - 8:00pm, 11:00am - 11:00pm\nTue:  1:00pm - 8:00pm, 11:00am - 11:00pm\nWed:  1:00pm - 8:00pm, 11:00am - 11:00pm\nThu:  1:00pm - 8:00pm, 11:00am - 11:00pm\nFri:  11:00am - 10:00pm, 11:00am - 1:00am\nSat:  11:00am - 10:00pm, 11:00am - 11:00am\nSun:  12:00pm - 6:00pm, 11:00am - 10:00pm\n\n","latitude":39.0963619,"longitude":-84.5087017,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"restaurant","locationTypeDisplay":"Restaurant\/Ale House","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-02 18:10:31","updateDate":"2014-12-15 02:46:10","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"op0A0h","name":"Northern Lights","nameDisplay":"Northern Lights","description":"Northern Lights is an extra-special India Pale Ale that is now available year-round.

In September 1999, Starr Hill Brewery was founded. Named after the local neighborhood, the brewery shared its space with the legendary Starr Hill Music Hall. Since then Starr Hill's delicious craft beers have become a favorite to visiting beer lovers, musicians, and music fans from around the world.\r\n\r\nIn response to the growing demand, Starr Hill moved from this small operation to a larger facility several miles outside of town in 2005. The brewery and tap room are still based in Crozet, nestled in the rolling foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Starr Hill's year-round, seasonal and limited-release brews are now enjoyed in bars, restaurants and music venues in the Mid Atlantic and Southeast and are also available at many grocery and convenience stores throughout the region. Among the most award-winning breweries on the East Coast, Starr Hill has won 21 Great American Beer Festival, World Beer Cup and Great British Beer Festival medals.\r\n\r\nLed by Brewmaster Robbie O'Cain, Starr Hill's team is striving to make creative and world-class beer every day.

In search of a calmer life and an even better beer, Jeff turned his passion for brewing into a career. After a temporary stint at Northern Brewer and a job as an assistant brewer at Minneapolis Town Hall Brewery, Flat Earth opened in Saint Paul and set out to create beers not normally found in the upper Midwest. Flat Earth's distinctive brews are often inspired by the couple's travels and time spent in conversation with family and friends. The company's brewing on the edge philosophy is reflected in its stylish interpretation of traditional brewing assumptions. Today, Flat Earth Brewing produces a variety of artisan ales and lagers every month. As the beers roll out of the brewery, you're sure to see a theme develop around their names  a hint of conspiracy, perhaps. The names are meant to get people thinking and talking. Whether you enjoy Flat Earth beers at home or out with friends, there are no secrets when it comes to good beer.","website":"http:\/\/flatearthbrewing.com\/","established":"2007","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/AulWoF\/upload_iM4ovC-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/AulWoF\/upload_iM4ovC-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/AulWoF\/upload_iM4ovC-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/AulWoF\/upload_iM4ovC-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/AulWoF\/upload_iM4ovC-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:45:56","locations":[{"id":"6gpvgZ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2035 Benson Avenue","locality":"St. Paul","region":"Minnesota","postalCode":"55116","website":"http:\/\/flatearthbrewing.com\/","latitude":44.9084187,"longitude":-93.1538067,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"LNr16q","name":"Hamm's Building","streetAddress":"688 Minnehaha Avenue East","locality":"Saint Paul","region":"Minnesota","postalCode":"55106","phone":"(651) 698-1945","website":"http:\/\/www.flatearthbrewing.com","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Sat: 12:00 pm - 6:30 pm","latitude":44.9629992,"longitude":-93.0716823,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-05-23 13:42:34","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"ihsvWA","name":"Norwegian Wood","nameDisplay":"Norwegian Wood","description":"We are happy to revive the first IPA ever brewed at the Grumpy Troll.
