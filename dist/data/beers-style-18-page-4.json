Before you pick up the glass for another sip you lick your lips and enjoy another subtle hit of maple.

At Gizmo Brew Works, this meeting of contemporary technology and ancient know-how produces a tempting slate of small-batch beers. Inside tanks that hold the equivalent of 1,000 pints each, brewers prep favorites including the smooth and sweet Black Stiletto Stout and the complex Palisade Wasp India Pale Ale with the same care that has earned many of their past beers medals at the Carolina Championship of Beer. They also save room for seasonals, carefully adding a sweet caramel flavor and spicy Noble hops to their altbier. These beers and more make frequent appearances in the brewery's taproom, gracing pint glasses for impromptu toasts or filling up growlers for at-home sips. Never ones to shy away from curious guests, brewers also open up their facility for Saturday tours, walking groups through the beer-making process during 30-minute explorations.","website":"http:\/\/gizmobrewworks.com\/","established":"2013","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/app.expressemailmarketing.com\/Survey.aspx?SFID=161238","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ehcJKn\/upload_a5TOKH-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ehcJKn\/upload_a5TOKH-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ehcJKn\/upload_a5TOKH-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ehcJKn\/upload_a5TOKH-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ehcJKn\/upload_a5TOKH-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-01 12:35:51","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:42:27","locations":[{"id":"t98PYN","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"5907 Triangle Drive","locality":"Raleigh","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"27617","phone":"(919) 782-2099","website":"http:\/\/gizmobrewworks.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Thu: 4:00 pm - 8:00 pm\r\nFri: 4:00 pm - 10:00 pm\r\nSat: 12:00 pm - 10:00 pm","latitude":35.8965383,"longitude":-78.7441045,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-01 12:36:52","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"mL4OsY","name":"Brewhouse Rarities: Cold Press Coffee Porter","nameDisplay":"Brewhouse Rarities: Cold Press Coffee Porter","description":"Porter brewed with cold press coffee","abv":"6","styleId":18,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-03-18 02:54:04","updateDate":"2016-03-22 18:32:21","style":{"id":18,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Brown Porter","shortName":"Brown Porter","description":"Brown porters are mid to dark brown (may have red tint) in color.

Under-qualified and unprepared, they started their journey with a Sherpa, a donkey, and a suitcase full of contraband. Naturally, half way through the trip the contraband was gone and the Sherpa and donkey had run off, leaving George and his group to fend for themselves. Luckily, everyone managed to make it off the mountain alive, and with a new outlook on life.\r\n\r\nHorn Dog Denver Colorado BeerLike any good beer drinker would at the end of an experience like that, George and his group found a local Pakistani hotel bar to have a drink in.

George gladly signed away and got down to some serious drinking. That\u2019s about the time he noticed a painting in the Flashman Hotel of a Flying Dog hanging on the wall that had been drawn by a local artist. Now, we all know dogs don\u2019t fly, but nobody told this particular dog it couldn\u2019t fly, just like no one had told George and his friends they couldn\u2019t make this extraordinary journey.

The two made many friends spending spare evenings in New England pubs offering European beers, which, before the emergence of American craft beers, were the best beers available. The two often discussed their dream of opening their own brewery over the years. In August of 2012, John and Dan decided to take the keg into their own hands, and ENKI Brewing Company was born.

With over 85 breweries in San Diego in January of 2013, we knew that we wanted to add our own unique contribution to the beer scene. Having been raised on both sides of the border, we always enjoyed eating from both cultures.  Mexican Street Tacos, chile enfused candies, enchiladas one day, and Hamburgers, mac and cheese and ding dongs the next. As adults we realized how unique being raised on the border was, how the mix of flavors was seeping from north to south, and south to north. It was this fusion in flavors that inspired to take traditional, European brewing traditions and infuse the process with a whole new palette of Latin American ingredients.  So we dug into our own roots for inspiration and found a treasure trove of brewing traditions, ingredients and unique flavors.
