Although it is strongly liable to the German Purity Law dated 1516 it is different to most other beers, since we are not filtering or pasteurizing it but bring it directly from the brewery to your table.\r\n\r\nIn order to make your stay a most pleasant one, we serve homemade Swabian delicacies with the freshly brewed beer. You can have a look on our traditional micro brewery directly from your seat in the restaurant and you can join a guided tour upon appointment. There are no separate rooms in our pleasant and friendly pub but we\u00b4ll be pleased to reserve the requested number of seats for you in one of our most comfortable places of the pub to make your stay with your friends or collegues most enjoyable.\r\n\r\nIf you come with a larger group of people you have the opportunity to rent the whole restaurant where we will spoil you with our speciality buffets.
