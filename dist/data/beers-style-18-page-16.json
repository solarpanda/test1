Krook's Mill, now the Manayunk Brewery and Restaurant, was one of the linchpins of the then booming industry. Anne Dawson opened the mill in 1822 at the mouth of the Manayunk Canal and the Krook family followed with the existing building just short of 100 years later in 1912. A cornerstone from the original mill was placed in the new building. Krook's Mill eventually closed its doors in 1992.\r\n\r\nFour years later, Harry Renner IV brought the facility back to life as a space for retail business, a fine eatery, a brewery and as an entertainment complex for both neighbors and visitors alike to enjoy. Our first batch of fresh-brewed beer was tapped on October 17, 1996. In 2000, we expanded our outdoor seating with a deck overlooking the Schuylkill River. In 2003, we added a Stone Pizza Oven and a Sushi Bar to expand our menu selection. Today you can still find the scale, now an antique, that was once used to weigh the wool brought into the factory.","website":"http:\/\/www.manayunkbrewery.com\/","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/dnnjFP\/upload_JV3nwS-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/dnnjFP\/upload_JV3nwS-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/dnnjFP\/upload_JV3nwS-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/dnnjFP\/upload_JV3nwS-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/dnnjFP\/upload_JV3nwS-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:01","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:51:33","locations":[{"id":"qHBDmR","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"4120 Main Street","locality":"Philadelphia","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"19127","phone":"215-482-8220","website":"http:\/\/www.manayunkbrewery.com\/","latitude":40.0235771,"longitude":-75.2202026,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:01","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"aQpHNT","name":"Peacemaker Porter","nameDisplay":"Peacemaker Porter","description":"A robust porter in style, a dark and full bodied ale with hints of roasted barley and flavors of coffee and bitter sweet chocolate on the palate.","abv":"5.5","styleId":18,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:56","updateDate":"2012-03-22 13:05:02","style":{"id":18,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Brown Porter","shortName":"Brown Porter","description":"Brown porters are mid to dark brown (may have red tint) in color.

We wanted a name that emulates that passionate and adventurous spirit of the Greenville community.\r\n\r\n\u201dPeople in Greenville are always on some kind of quest.

We\u2019re at the foot of Lookout Mountain just steps away from the world-famous Incline Railway and very near to the great Moccasin Bend of the Tennessee River. \r\n\r\nMBBC was started by two brewers whose quest for the perfect beer led them to learn the art of brewing.  Chris Hunt and Duncan Guy began their brewing education in the Barley Mob Brewers homebrewing club and continued to search for unique and distinctive ale and lager formulas. They decided to offer their creations to the public through a small batch microbrewery in 2006.  Soon thereafter, award-winning brewer Courtney Tyvand joined the two and presented his smoked porter at the brewery\u2019s first beer dinner in October of 2006.\r\n\r\nThe brewery is located on the ground floor of a historic building at 4015 Tennessee Avenue in St. Elmo.  The building is constructed of foot-square cedar timbers and two-foot thick walls made of granite stone and mortar.  Built in 1911 as a packaging factory for K-Rations for WWI, we occasionally find artifacts from that era in the building walls and ceiling.  The brewery shares space with the Chattanooga U-Brew, a brew-on-premises business owned by Greg McCort. \r\n\r\nMBBC is proud to offer small batch specialty ales and lagers in kegs of various sizes.  A tasting room is part of the brewery; samples of our beers can be tasted and tested on premises.  Occasionally we have tasting events or tapping events at the brewery or at a nearby bar or restaurant.  Please check our calendar for scheduled tasting events at the brewery.","website":"http:\/\/www.bendbrewingbeer.com\/","established":"2006","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/zpGIxB\/upload_qc0XVO-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/zpGIxB\/upload_qc0XVO-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/zpGIxB\/upload_qc0XVO-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/zpGIxB\/upload_qc0XVO-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/zpGIxB\/upload_qc0XVO-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:02","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:09:53","locations":[{"id":"7MLLbj","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"4015 Tennessee Avenue","locality":"Chattanooga","region":"Tennessee","postalCode":"37409","phone":"423-821-6392","website":"http:\/\/www.bendbrewingbeer.com\/","latitude":35.007563,"longitude":-85.327766,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2006","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:02","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"TdF3SM","name":"Peeping Ron","nameDisplay":"Peeping Ron","description":"Slightly sweet porter brewed with marshmallow peeps.","styleId":18,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-11-12 18:45:59","updateDate":"2015-11-12 19:58:29","style":{"id":18,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Brown Porter","shortName":"Brown Porter","description":"Brown porters are mid to dark brown (may have red tint) in color.

Brewers eventually matched this by brewing with high roasted malts, providing a dark, cloudy and hoppy brew.  This beer quickly became the favorite of porters working in London area markets and eventually the beer adopted the name of its main consumers. Our blend of black and chocolate malts provides a distinct hint of chocolate which is balanced lightly with Warrior and other hops making this a distinct and palatable porter. We hope you enjoy the tradition.","abv":"5","glasswareId":5,"availableId":1,"styleId":18,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/MQ1eA7\/upload_s5JNsM-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/MQ1eA7\/upload_s5JNsM-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/MQ1eA7\/upload_s5JNsM-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:56","updateDate":"2015-12-16 04:40:04","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":18,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Brown Porter","shortName":"Brown Porter","description":"Brown porters are mid to dark brown (may have red tint) in color.

After returning to the states, they had trouble finding that type of beer in Chicago so they opened Two Brothers Brewing Company in 1996. To get them started, the brothers' grandfather, a retired dairy farmer, donated his bulk milk tanks, which were quickly converted to fermenters. Currently, the brewery resides in a 40,000 square foot facility 30 miles west of Chicago. In addition to their traditional style beers, Two Brothers Brewing Company produces many specialty beers including the Project Opus Sour series. Adjacent to the brewery, Two Brothers Tap House opened in 2008 as a restaurant which serves elevated, seasonal, and organic American pub fare.

In 1997 Elysian was chosen to operate a pub and small brewery at Gameworks\u2014a large entertainment complex owned by Universal Studios, Dreamworks & Sega. Elysian left this partnership in 2002 upon expiration of the five-year contract. A short year later Elysian opened TangleTown, an 80-seat neighborhood brewery\/bistro. With a 3-bbl pilot brewery, Elysian-TangleTown acted as the brewers' test kitchen, fueling the creative fires and helping cement Elysian's reputation as Seattle\u2019s top brewpub. The most recent addition to the Elysian empire, Elysian Fields, opened in August 2006. Perched next to Seattle\u2019s two sports arenas, Fields seats 400 and packs the house at lunch and on gamedays.

We began as a herb farm, growing culinary and medicinal herbs for the garden center trade. \r\n \r\nOur herb farm, Sunflower Cottage, grows 120,000 potted herb plants each spring from seeds and cuttings to sell to other garden centers and to our own customers. \r\n \r\nIn the fall of 2012, we built our hops field.  After all, hops are the herbs that flavor beer.  Hops provide the bitter balance to the sweet malt that feeds yeast, which ferments beer.\r\n \r\nIn 2013 we began the process of creating an ordinance in Warren County to accomodate farm breweries.  By late spring, the process was complete and Backroom Brewery became the first farm brewery in the Northern Shenandoah Valley.\r\n \r\nOur first hop harvest in August of 2013 was bountiful.  We were brewing in small batches and planning our brewery construction.  In the spring of 2014 we began construction and finished our brewery building plus equipment installation by July of 2014. \r\n \r\nLife is good and we are living the dream. \r\n \r\nWe now have nearly 20 beer recipes approved by the State of VA. \r\n \r\nOur tasting room bustles and our scratch kitchen cranks out delicious dishes prepared with our own fresh herbs and farm grown produce in season.\r\n \r\nIn the spring , summer and fall, gardens abound, families enjoy the farm, the scenery, the corn hole, the labyrinth and chalk boards. Pets are welcome.\r\n \r\nWe host 3 annual events, The Virginia Herb Festival (June), BRB Hop Harvest Party (August) and BRB Holiday Market (November). \r\n \r\nYou are cordially invited to come and drink our beer, eat, play and spend some time.","website":"http:\/\/www.backroombreweryva.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BQFHyL\/upload_QcGVGX-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BQFHyL\/upload_QcGVGX-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BQFHyL\/upload_QcGVGX-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BQFHyL\/upload_QcGVGX-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BQFHyL\/upload_QcGVGX-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-04-18 17:05:13","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:07:46","locations":[{"id":"CEon99","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"150 Ridgemont Rd.","locality":"Middletown","region":"Virginia","postalCode":"22645","phone":"540-869-8482","latitude":38.9956004,"longitude":-78.2210269,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"nano","locationTypeDisplay":"Nano Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-04-18 17:05:13","updateDate":"2015-11-19 22:21:12","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"EqkdaS","name":"PeterPaul Coconut Porter","nameDisplay":"PeterPaul Coconut Porter","abv":"5.5","styleId":18,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-03 20:39:41","updateDate":"2015-02-03 20:39:41","style":{"id":18,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Brown Porter","shortName":"Brown Porter","description":"Brown porters are mid to dark brown (may have red tint) in color.

We foster a team oriented management style. We offer an excellent casual, yet professional, dining experience for our guests, never pretentious, emphasizing \"fun & friendly... brewpub style\" menu selections and service. We are high-volume, fast paced and right in the middle of all the action for the dozens of events that take place right outside our doorstep on Prescott's hometown Courthouse Plaza. We are community minded and involved in many local events and fundraisers. Our kitchen is a 99% scratch kitchen, providing a large & varied menu. Our bar is lively and we attract people of all ages and backgrounds. We are hands-on owners and look for managers with the same philosophy.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re also pleased to announce that Prescott Brewing Company, the MICROBREWERY, is now an extension of our brewery operations!  With the introduction of PBC\u2019s Liquid Amber Ale and Ponderosa IPA in cans, we quickly outgrew our little 7-barrel brewhouse that\u2019s been our workhorse since opening in 1994.  So we bit the bullet and built an off-site microbrewery production plant out by the Prescott airport in 2011.  The first 30-barrel batch of Liquid Amber was brewed by John and Lead Brewer, Jan, on December 27th, 2011 and was a true better- late- than- never Christmas gift!  Look for both brands increasingly available throughout Arizona.  And thus the story continues.  \r\n\r\nPBC celebrated its 20TH ANNIVERSARY downtown Prescott in March of 2014\u2026.thanks to our many loyal supporters, locals and visitors alike. 20 years of hard labor...nah, not that bad, but 20 years in the restaurant business is a LONG time!  So, we\u2019ll just keep on keepin\u2019 on and are excited to expand the selection of canned product for distribution as production allows out at the airport location.\r\n\r\nYOU are included amongst those who've allowed us to thrive, contribute to our community and keep 65-75 employees on staff all year long! As everyone knows, these have been difficult times for many. We believe every one of us knows personally of someone who has struggled these past few years with job loss, or a small business owner who has had to lay off a good employee, or maybe has had to close their business. Luckily, PBC is okay, thanks to YOU. Not to say we wouldn\u2019t want more of the dining dollars out there...but we\u2019re extremely grateful for the continued support of those in our community and visitors from literally all over the world. We\u2019d like to remind everyone that each of us can make a difference in our communities by shopping local, supporting locally-owned, independent businesses, supporting our local charities and non-profits and volunteering for our favorite causes. Prescott is an amazing community...let\u2019s keep it that way!

From a funky storefront on the famous Pacific Coast Highway the duo ran the \u201cPizza Port\u201d with a classic menu of pizza and chicken wings to which they added their own \u201cSan Diego\u201d twist.  The Original Pizza Port in Solana Beach\r\n\r\nThe parking was limited and the building crowded with simple hand-built picnic tables and a hodge-podge d\u00e9cor of surf-related paraphernalia almost at odds with the sophisticated flavors of the food. But word spread quickly and it wasn\u2019t long before Pizza Port was a local favorite. \r\n\r\nEarly on Vince took advantage of free space in the restaurant\u2019s storage area to dabble with home brewing. The hobby took off and he was eventually brewing more than could reasonably be consumed at home. So at the urging of friends and fans, the Vince and Gina decided to go into the brewpub business. Pizza Port offered its first craft-brewed beers to patrons in 1992. \r\n\r\nEmbracing the same \u201cflavor-driven\u201d principles that had made the pizza menu so popular, Pizza Port quickly gained a reputation in San Diego\u2019s nascent craft beer scene. In 1997 the company opened a second location a few miles north of Solana Beach in Carlsbad, and a third in 2003 in San Clemente. The same year San Clemente opened (as well as the year after), the original location in Solana Beach won Great American Beer Festival \u201cSmall Brewpub of the Year\u201d. \r\n\r\nThe Pizza Port family\u2019s reputation for great foods and craft beer continued to grow, making them landmarks not just for Southern Californians, but for beer lovers from around the world. In 2008 they opened a premium bottle shop with more that 600 craft beers adjacent to the Carlsbad locations, and by the end of the first decade of the 21st century, the Pizza Ports were a brewing dynasty. In 2009 the Pizza Ports won a staggering 9 medals at the 2009 Great American Beer Festival and Pizza Port Carlsbad was named \u201cLarge Brewpub of the Year\u201d.","website":"http:\/\/www.pizzaport.com\/","established":"1987","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QSVVxD\/upload_g7L5OH-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QSVVxD\/upload_g7L5OH-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QSVVxD\/upload_g7L5OH-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QSVVxD\/upload_g7L5OH-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QSVVxD\/upload_g7L5OH-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:10:31","locations":[{"id":"DrFlD0","name":"Carlsbad","streetAddress":"571 Carlsbad Village Dr.","locality":"Carlsbad","region":"California","postalCode":"92008","phone":"760-720-7007","website":"http:\/\/www.pizzaport.com\/locations\/carlsbad\/","latitude":33.1596505,"longitude":-117.3478111,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1997","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"qAyZMR","name":"Solana Beach","streetAddress":"135 N.
