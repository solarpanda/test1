We are an artisinal nano-brewery in the city of Carpinteria, CA that focuses on creating small batch beers with an experimental approach. Rob and Steve met in 1999 and brewed their first batch of beer together in 2008. While attending UCSB, Rob met Peter while visiting Orella Ranch in Gaviota and they began brewing beer together in the Santa Barbara area. Then, in the summer of 2011, the three of them converged for a backpacking trip (pictured above) on The Lost Coast of Northern California - it was on this trip that they first discussed starting a brewery together. In late 2012 after some serious brainstorming and long meetings, the initiative had begun and planning was underway.\r\n \r\nIt is vitally important to us that we are directly involved with the production of our raw materials.  We are growing our own hops in the Santa Barbara area to supplement our usage, and in the future we plan to be growing enough to supply hops to the local community.  Our grains will be grown in the Santa Ynez Valley and malted right here in Santa Barbara.  All of our solid waste (spent grains, hops, yeast) will be fed to local pigs, local cricket farmers, or composted .  We will participate in, and contribute to, local festivals and events that revolve around brewing, environmentalism, and the promotion of local businesses.","website":"http:\/\/www.brewlabcraft.com","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/DFJoPF\/upload_AttrGR-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/DFJoPF\/upload_AttrGR-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/DFJoPF\/upload_AttrGR-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/DFJoPF\/upload_AttrGR-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/DFJoPF\/upload_AttrGR-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-04-06 17:17:38","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:07:16","locations":[{"id":"9Hqlzg","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"4191-8 Carpinteria Ave.","locality":"Carpinteria","region":"California","postalCode":"93013","phone":"949.922.9152","hoursOfOperation":"Fri:  4:00pm - 9:00pm\nSat:  4:00pm - 9:00pm\nSun:  2:00pm - 7:00pm\n\n","latitude":34.4037704,"longitude":-119.5337568,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-04-07 19:22:22","updateDate":"2015-04-07 19:22:22","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"1OkhQw","name":"Pearental Guidance Suggested","nameDisplay":"Pearental Guidance Suggested","description":"There is something about Saisons that has always screamed pears to me.

Our mantra is big, bold flavors, made exactingly with natural ingredients. So, for example, if we say a beer will taste like peanut butter and jelly, you can be sure you\u2019ll smell and taste the fresh roasted peanuts and fruity berry jam. Our flagship beers such as Hop Gun IPA and Floridian Hefeweizen, also strive towards big, bold flavor. It\u2019s who we are.\r\n\r\nOur Brewery is located in the heart of Oakland Park\u2019s new Culinary Arts District. The 20,000 sq-ft facility is powered by a 30-barrel, three-piece brewhouse, which feeds nearly 1000 gallons of beer per batch into our four 60-barrel fermenters - a capacity that makes us South Florida\u2019s largest craft microbrewery. Each of our distinctive beers is brewed using the finest, all-natural ingredients, then served up unpasteurized, unfiltered, and unfussed with. We offer tours of our 20,000 sq-ft facility, rotating food trucks nightly, and growlers of our brewery fresh beer to-go.\r\n\r\nYou can sample our creations in our spacious tap room - open 7 days a week, noon to midnight - as well as in bars and restaurants all across South Florida. And of course, we still brew at our original location in Boca Raton, the Funky Buddha Brewery & Lounge, which has become a test kitchen for our more experimental brews.\r\n\r\nSee you soon for a pint!

One day, while gathering flowers in a field, Persephone was abducted by Hades, who whisked her away to the Underworld to be his Queen. Persephone\u2019s mother, Goddess of the Harvest, was understandably despondent, wandering the Earth in search of her daughter. During that time, warmth disappeared, crops withered, and the land fell into a perpetual winter.\r\n\r\nAt some length, Hades was persuaded to surrender Persephone for one-half of every year \u2013  the Spring and Summer seasons \u2013 so that flowers could bloom and the earth might bear fruit once more. To this day, the half-year that Persephone spends every twelve months in the Underworld inevitably hearkens the return of a cold and barren period.\r\n\r\nAt Legion Brewing, we just weren\u2019t ready to capitulate to six months of frosty temperatures every year \u2013 we live in The South, you know!
