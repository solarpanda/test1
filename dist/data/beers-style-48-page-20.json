The phenolic characteristics are often described as clove-, nutmeg-like, mildly smoke-like or even vanilla-like. Banana-like esters should be present at low to medium-high levels. These beers are made with at least 50 percent malted wheat, and hop rates are quite low. Hop flavor and aroma are absent or present at very low levels. Weissbier is well attenuated and very highly carbonated and a medium to full bodied beer. The color is very pale to pale amber. Because yeast is present, the beer will have yeast flavor and a characteristically fuller mouthfeel and may be appropriately very cloudy. No diacetyl should be perceived.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"15","abvMin":"4.9","abvMax":"5.5","srmMin":"3","srmMax":"9","ogMin":"1.047","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.016","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:29:27"},"breweries":[{"id":"1AH8nV","name":"Les 3 Brasseurs","nameShortDisplay":"Les 3 Brasseurs","description":"In a time in Northern France where trucks and commercial transportation were not yet a part of daily life, the process of brewing beer was a very different one than it is today. In small villages across Europe, it was the local brewer that filled the vessels of pubs and caf\u00e9s with beer made from his own closely guarded recipes. With the advent of industrialization, however, local breweries all but disappeared, bringing to an end the era of the authentic microbrewery.\r\n\r\nTwenty years ago, a family of brewers decided to revive the traditions of the past that were deeply rooted in three generations of their family \u2013 thus the name The 3 Brewers \u2013 \u201cthree\u201d for three generations of brewing tradition. The 3 Brewers opened its very first microbrewery restaurant in Place de la Gare \u00e0 Lille in 1986. Since then operations have expanded to 28 locations in France as well as several restaurants in other parts of the world including Quebec and soon Ontario.\r\n\r\nLes 3 Brasseurs' success can be attributed to a unique concept: Fresh non-pasteurized beer made from the purest ingredients and from traditional recipes \u2013 all brewed right at the heart of each of our restaurants for patrons to see.","website":"http:\/\/www.les3brasseurs.com\/","established":"1986","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1AH8nV\/upload_47XK2t-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1AH8nV\/upload_47XK2t-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1AH8nV\/upload_47XK2t-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1AH8nV\/upload_47XK2t-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1AH8nV\/upload_47XK2t-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-02-24 14:45:21","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:28:18","locations":[{"id":"Ez9FvZ","name":"Ste-Catherine","streetAddress":"732 Ste-Catherine St. W.","locality":"Montreal","region":"Quebec","phone":"514.788.6333","website":"http:\/\/www.les3brasseurs.ca\/eng\/ste_catherine.php","hoursOfOperation":"Monday: 11:30 -

We let the yeast take over the majority of the flavoring in our fermenters, providing the beer with banana and clove like esters. We pull some of the yeast with it to give this brew the proper style and to keep its body and character.

We brew high quality beers with an uncompromising focus on detail, from the ingredient selection to the brewing process. A specially designed JV Northwest brewing system creates more flavorful beers by allowing more barley to be used in the brewing process.  We also use a special bottling machine that keeps the beer fresher, and extends storage times compared to other conventional microbrewery bottling machines. This is very beneficial to retain all the character of these flavorful styles of beer.\r\n\r\nHoppin\u2019 Frog is the concept of owner and established brewmaster Fred Karm, who has designed and produced more award-winning beers than any other professional brewer in Ohio since 2000. All of these awards were won at the 2 most prestigious contests in the world, including the Great American Beer Festival and the World Beer Cup. Mr. Karm has been a brewer of specialty beers since 1994, a life-long Akron, Ohio resident, and is a graduate of the University Of Akron.","website":"http:\/\/www.hoppinfrog.com\/","established":"2006","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/w5OOQ5\/upload_j5DrDQ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/w5OOQ5\/upload_j5DrDQ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/w5OOQ5\/upload_j5DrDQ-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/w5OOQ5\/upload_j5DrDQ-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/w5OOQ5\/upload_j5DrDQ-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:48:26","locations":[{"id":"UnpaXM","name":"The Tasting Room at Hoppin' Frog","streetAddress":"1680-F East Waterloo Rd.","locality":"Akron","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"44306","phone":"234-525-3764","website":"http:\/\/www.hoppinfrog.com\/","latitude":41.0245928,"longitude":-81.4677107,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2015-08-18 14:10:32","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"srtxUf","name":"Wild Mary\u2019s Hefeweisen","nameDisplay":"Wild Mary\u2019s Hefeweisen","description":"Wild as they come, we sometimes say wheat, but this is a classic German weiss.

With 70% of the grist being wheat, this beer will have a wheaty flavor and the noble hops used in the brewing process are almost undetectable. To avoid the overly banana\/apple\/pear aroma and flavor sometimes noticed in hefeweizens, we ferment at a lower temperature for a period time then allow the fermentation temperature to naturally rise as energy from the yeast is released. This gives our hefeweizen a great balance of clove and banana so your pallet is completely satisfied.","abv":"5","ibu":"13","glasswareId":9,"srmId":6,"availableId":1,"styleId":48,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/GFq0zV\/upload_w8rIf8-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/GFq0zV\/upload_w8rIf8-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/GFq0zV\/upload_w8rIf8-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","servingTemperature":"cold","servingTemperatureDisplay":"Cold - (4-7C\/39-45F)","createDate":"2014-03-26 12:11:07","updateDate":"2015-12-17 11:34:05","glass":{"id":9,"name":"Weizen","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"srm":{"id":6,"name":"6","hex":"F8A600"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":48,"categoryId":4,"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"South German-Style Hefeweizen \/ Hefeweissbier","shortName":"Hefeweizen","description":"The aroma and flavor of a Weissbier with yeast is decidedly fruity and phenolic.

After homebrewing on the family farm for years, homebrewer Cory Schroeder teamed up with Jim Wiesender to found the brewery in 1999.\r\n\r\nUsing equipment scrounged from various industries, such as a converted pudding tank for the brew kettle, the pair launched a successful business, brewing the beer just steps away from the chicken coop and a busy dairy farm.\r\n\r\nTheir Sand Creek Golden Ale and English Style Special Ale, available only on draft and in half-gallon growlers, soon developed a reputation throughout Wisconsin's many brew fests. With a capacity of only about 150 barrels per year, the brewery, now with a third owner on board, quickly outgrew the little farm shed converted into a brewhouse.\r\n\r\nHoping to remain in the Dunn\/St. Croix counties area, the company looked for a suitable place to relocate, but came up empty handed. Then opportunity knocked in the form of a phone call one evening from their friend in Black River Falls, Pioneer brewing's brewmaster Todd Krueger. The brewery was for sale.\r\n\r\nIn March of 2004 the combined forces of the two breweries officially formed the new Sand Creek Brewing Co. of Black River Falls, Wisconsin.","website":"http:\/\/www.sandcreekbrewing.com\/","established":"1999","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gsADrL\/upload_RPFu23-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gsADrL\/upload_RPFu23-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gsADrL\/upload_RPFu23-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gsADrL\/upload_RPFu23-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gsADrL\/upload_RPFu23-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:56:58","locations":[{"id":"TSKxwK","name":"Sand Creek Brewing Co","streetAddress":"320 Pierce St","extendedAddress":"Box 187","locality":"Black River Falls","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"54615","phone":"(715) 284-7553","website":"http:\/\/www.sandcreekbrewing.com\/","latitude":44.2830622,"longitude":-90.7913227,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1998","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2015-12-04 17:57:24","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"WfHl3C","name":"Workingman's Wheat","nameDisplay":"Workingman's Wheat","description":"Light crisp American style wheat with a medium hop finish.
