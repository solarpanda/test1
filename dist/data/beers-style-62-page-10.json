Tafelbully is the bully of the other table beers, pushing them around with its citrusy dry hopping, Belgian yeast spiciness, and a refreshing Brettanomyces finish. Even though it is a bit bolder than most, this is still a session beer. It features a delicate malt character from the European pilsner and specialty malts and judicious dry hopping with citrusy Sorachi and Amarillo to compliment the gentle fruitiness and delicate phenols of the Belgian and Brettanomyces yeasts.","abv":"5.4","ibu":"26","glasswareId":5,"srmId":4,"availableId":2,"styleId":62,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/EwW4cy\/upload_e9msBa-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/EwW4cy\/upload_e9msBa-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/EwW4cy\/upload_e9msBa-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:44:20","updateDate":"2015-12-16 11:35:53","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"srm":{"id":4,"name":"4","hex":"FFBF42"},"available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"style":{"id":62,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"Belgian Pale","description":"Belgian-style pale ales are characterized by low but noticeable hop bitterness, flavor, and aroma.

Stay tuned to our facebook and twitter for the most up to date info!\r\n\u200b\r\nAround 1910, a 16 year old kid in Fort Wayne decided he wanted to be a pilot.  He designed a plane and built it with $1800 fom his parents after they had mortgaged their home.  Anxious to try his new design, he promptly flew and crashed the plane, demolishing it.  He redesigned and successfully flew his plane, possibly making him the first person in Fort Wayne to fly on his own.  This earned him the name Birdboy.  After making a name for himself locally, Birdboy travelled the country and the world, all the while updating and refining his design.  He became a huge influence on aviation throughout the world, and Smith Field here in Fort Wayne is named after him. \r\n \r\nThrough Birdboy Brewing, we hope to embrace Birdboy's adventurous spirit by offering new and exciting choices in the local beer scene.","website":"http:\/\/www.birdboybrewing.com\/","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/y0Q23K\/upload_m9Pip2-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/y0Q23K\/upload_m9Pip2-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/y0Q23K\/upload_m9Pip2-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/y0Q23K\/upload_m9Pip2-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/y0Q23K\/upload_m9Pip2-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-01-15 14:46:42","updateDate":"2016-01-15 14:50:34","locations":[{"id":"cxmroT","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"210 E Collins Rd.","locality":"Fort Wayne","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"46825","phone":"260-579-5508","website":"http:\/\/www.birdboybrewing.com\/","latitude":41.1217689,"longitude":-85.1395111,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-01-15 14:53:57","updateDate":"2016-01-15 14:53:57","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"DZKYY9","name":"Tamarack","nameDisplay":"Tamarack","description":"Our Flagship Beer, Brewed Much Like A American Pale Ale But Uses A Blend Of Sorachi Ace And Cascade Hops Throughout The Boil.

Since that time, he has fallen in love with beer and brewing and felt compelled to do it professionally, and in 2012, Kenny opened Beer Hound Brewery.\r\n\r\nNot long after Beer Hound opened, friends & beer entrepreneurs Frank Becker & Rick Cash saw the potential in the great-tasting brews that were part of the Beer Hound lineup. They joined forces with Beer Hound Brewery and decided to bring the great tasting microbrews to the Town of Culpeper, Virginia.  In October of 2014, Beer Hound Brewery opened its doors as the first-ever brewery in Culpeper. Local and visiting beer enthusiasts descended upon the new establishment immediately and now the Beer Hound brand is a mainstay of the arts district in Downtown Culpeper.\r\n\r\nAll of the Beer Hound beers are named after famous hounds in movies and history, with an attempt to link the beer style to the hound.

The original brewery was built by Nick and Simon in a run down warehouse located in Hammond, Indiana. The first beers brewed by the brothers were designed to be a departure from the fairly bleak craft brewing scene in the region. Nick and Simon brewed intense balanced beers that were and still remain \u201cnot normal\u201d by conventional standards.\r\n\r\nIn November of 2005, after receiving numerous visitors to the brewery over the years, Three Floyds opened its own brewpub at the production facility.

In memoriam, you can find his last name on the brewery and every bottle of Stella Artois around the world.\r\n\r\nThe Artois Brewery was so beloved internationally and locally, a special batch was created as a Christmas gift to the people of Leuven. That special batch was the first to officially include \"Stella\" in its name. \"Stella\", meaning star in Latin, pays homage to this original occasion, accompanied by a star on every bottle.\r\n\r\nSo next time you see a bottle of Stella Artois, take note of the rich history paired with the rich flavor on and in every bottle.","website":"http:\/\/www.stellaartois.com\/","established":"1366","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/mIWMKP\/upload_bVYTEJ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/mIWMKP\/upload_bVYTEJ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/mIWMKP\/upload_bVYTEJ-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/mIWMKP\/upload_bVYTEJ-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/mIWMKP\/upload_bVYTEJ-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:48","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:41:42","locations":[{"id":"x5tPgB","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Vaartstraat 94","locality":"Leuven","region":"Vlaams Brabant","phone":"32-016-24-71-11","latitude":50.8870692,"longitude":4.7025108,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"BE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:48","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"BE","name":"BELGIUM","displayName":"Belgium","isoThree":"BEL","numberCode":56,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"B76yaP","name":"Vineg\u00f6blin","nameDisplay":"Vineg\u00f6blin","description":"Vinegoblin was a runner up name for my kitten that used to play amidst the hop vines here at the Borealis Fermentery.

The recipe was developed by Willy De Lobel. In the absence of a brewing plant, Willy wandered through the Flemish hinterland in search of professionals that could brew his recipe.\r\n\r\nHis journey ended when he found the brewery of Dirk Naudts, called \u201cDe Proefbrouwerij\u201d. There Dirk and his staff continued to perfect the brewing process of Viven. \r\n\r\nIn 2003, Willy De Lobel decided it was time to pass on his demanding hobby, to a young and ambitious entrepreneur. In the little village of Sijsele, Willy found an enthusiastic successor in the person of Tony Traen, the son of the local liquor dealer Cyril Traen, who decided the beer was an enrichment for his company and has since taken on the job of carrying on the tradition.\r\n\r\nSince then, Chapel of Viven has undergone several changes: a brand new look, an improved recipe for the Monastery of Viven and a new name. Chapel and Monastry of Viven were baptized Viven Blond and Viven Brown.\r\n\r\nIn 2009 the time was ripe for an expansion of the range Viven. The idea to apply our Flemish brewing art to non-Flemish beers haunted Tony and together with Dirk he developed the recipes of the promising Viven Ale, Viven Porter and Viven Imperial IPA. These exceptional beers, that would truly tempt any beer connoisseur, have been successfully launched onto the beer market in 2010, making them accessible to a wider audience of beer lovers.","website":"http:\/\/www.viven.be\/","established":"1999","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:27:34","locations":[{"id":"02rQpe","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Stationsstraat 89","locality":"Sijsele","postalCode":"8340","phone":"+32 (0)50 35 34 94","website":"http:\/\/www.viven.be\/","latitude":51.2078041,"longitude":3.3173741,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"BE","yearOpened":"1999","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"BE","name":"BELGIUM","displayName":"Belgium","isoThree":"BEL","numberCode":56,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"3YsgGc","name":"W'09 Belgian Style Ale","nameDisplay":"W'09 Belgian Style Ale","description":"Our take on a classic Belgian style golden ale.

With our vast array of beer styles, you're sure to find a brew that suits you.\r\n \r\nOur Belgian-Style Ales include:\r\nNaked Nun Wit\r\nBlack Rhino Black Ale\r\nScratchin' Hippo Biere de Garde\r\nPhilosophizer Saison\r\nDancin' Monks Dubbel Ale\r\nTripel B Tripel Ale\r\nThe Traveler Belgian IPA\r\nFlyin' Monks Quadrupel Ale\r\n \r\nAlso, look for our Barrel-Aged \"Vintage Series\" where we age one of our eight ales in oak barrels for an extended period of time.\r\n\r\nAlthough our selection of beer is great to enjoy by itself; each of them also pair perfectly with just about any food. From spicy Thai food to a backyard barbecue with ribs and brisket, to a formal dinner with steak or seafood and a dark chocolate dessert; our artisanal Belgian-style ales go with pretty much everything. Please share pictures and recipes that you've either used our beer to cook with or have enjoyed right alongside them!","website":"http:\/\/www.adelbertsbeer.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/7Tjp4C\/upload_UUm4SE-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/7Tjp4C\/upload_UUm4SE-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/7Tjp4C\/upload_UUm4SE-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/7Tjp4C\/upload_UUm4SE-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/7Tjp4C\/upload_UUm4SE-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:43","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:15:11","locations":[{"id":"6PBXvz","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2314 Rutland Drive","extendedAddress":"Suite #100","locality":"Austin","region":"Texas","postalCode":"78758","phone":"512-568-1462","website":"http:\/\/www.adelbertsbeer.com\/","latitude":30.382666,"longitude":-97.720162,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:43","updateDate":"2015-12-03 19:17:16","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Osf9oj","name":"White Belgo Pale Ale","nameDisplay":"White Belgo Pale Ale","abv":"5","styleId":62,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-03 17:46:02","updateDate":"2014-09-07 17:32:15","style":{"id":62,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"Belgian Pale","description":"Belgian-style pale ales are characterized by low but noticeable hop bitterness, flavor, and aroma.

Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"B.O.M.","description":"BOMBrewery stands for Belgian Original Malt Bakery and Brewery. In the days of old, each brewery had its own malt bakery, also called the malting house. Starting from this tradition, we bake, as first malt bakery in the world, all our own malts ourselves. It concerns here new kinds of malt that we develop especially for each beer individually. They are unique and baked according to traditional methods.\r\n\r\nWe create our own beer recipes that we brew according to the principle of the gipsy-brewery. This means that we hire the wort boilers of a brewery to brew our own beer. We are convinced that not the kettles determine the taste of the beer, but on the contrary the malt baker and the brewing master.\r\n\r\nThe Triporteur beers are our point of departure and our basic beers. Besides those, we also launch a special beer line with once-off products. The beers are brewed using once-off kinds of malts or grains and will be put on the market under the collective name Special Roast Series.","website":"http:\/\/bombrewery.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/z0D11f\/upload_QLHItS-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/z0D11f\/upload_QLHItS-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/z0D11f\/upload_QLHItS-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/z0D11f\/upload_QLHItS-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/z0D11f\/upload_QLHItS-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-10-26 14:03:41","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:38:28","locations":[{"id":"hXBr1n","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Kromstraat 8","region":"Bree","postalCode":"3960","phone":"+32 (0) 479 68 10 24","website":"http:\/\/bombrewery.com\/","latitude":51.140624,"longitude":5.584053,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"BE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-10-26 14:04:20","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"BE","name":"BELGIUM","displayName":"Belgium","isoThree":"BEL","numberCode":56,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"5offhk","name":"Wildeman","nameDisplay":"Wildeman","abv":"7.5","styleId":62,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/5offhk\/upload_enErjZ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/5offhk\/upload_enErjZ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/5offhk\/upload_enErjZ-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-03-08 13:19:49","updateDate":"2015-12-16 15:28:16","style":{"id":62,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"Belgian Pale","description":"Belgian-style pale ales are characterized by low but noticeable hop bitterness, flavor, and aroma.

The villains of the peace in this story are two non-conformist, 'not likely to take it lying down' ranchers named George Stranahan and Richard McIntyre.\r\n\r\nAs George tells it, he and 11 of his closest friends and family decided to embark on what they called an \u201camateur mountaineering expedition\u201d to climb K2 in the Himalayas. Under-qualified and unprepared, they started their journey with a Sherpa, a donkey, and a suitcase full of contraband. Naturally, half way through the trip the contraband was gone and the Sherpa and donkey had run off, leaving George and his group to fend for themselves. Luckily, everyone managed to make it off the mountain alive, and with a new outlook on life.\r\n\r\nHorn Dog Denver Colorado BeerLike any good beer drinker would at the end of an experience like that, George and his group found a local Pakistani hotel bar to have a drink in. Now, alcohol is banned in most Muslim nations, but if you sign an affidavit stating you are the son of a Christian, it\u2019s like a license to drink. George gladly signed away and got down to some serious drinking. That\u2019s about the time he noticed a painting in the Flashman Hotel of a Flying Dog hanging on the wall that had been drawn by a local artist. Now, we all know dogs don\u2019t fly, but nobody told this particular dog it couldn\u2019t fly, just like no one had told George and his friends they couldn\u2019t make this extraordinary journey. The Flying Dog became a symbol that George and his group used to describe what had happened to them with the mantra, \u201cit is amazing what you can achieve if nobody tells you that you can't.","website":"http:\/\/www.flyingdogbrewery.com\/","established":"1990","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jmGoBA\/upload_H9xzdZ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jmGoBA\/upload_H9xzdZ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jmGoBA\/upload_H9xzdZ-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jmGoBA\/upload_H9xzdZ-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jmGoBA\/upload_H9xzdZ-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:46:05","locations":[{"id":"EPqUQP","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"4607 Wedgewood Blvd","locality":"Frederick","region":"Maryland","postalCode":"21703","phone":"301-694-7899","website":"http:\/\/www.flyingdogales.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Tours are offered every Thursday and Friday from 4 to 6 pm, along with two sessions on Saturday (12 to 2 pm and 2:30 - 4:30 pm).","latitude":39.361926,"longitude":-77.424677,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1983","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
