We\u2019ve already made collaborations with breweries from the Netherlands, England, Denmark and Brazil. It\u2019s fun to develop a recipe together and to learn from each other. And of course having fun with what you like most, brewing, talking about and drinking beer.\r\n\r\nBy exporting our beers to other countries, we show the rest of the world that craft beer is growing in the Netherlands. And with success: early 2013 Rooie Dop was awarded the title \u201cBest new brewer in the Netherlands\u201d by the international website RateBeer.com.

Always looking to take a good thing too far, we sat down and over a beer (or two) decided that beer itself was a good idea. Of course, not just some easy-drinking institutional prole beer, but stuff like the beers we'd had at great bars. We had frequented places with extensive and varied beer lists. Places with lists 180 items long, all of which we tried twice (not in one night). In short, we wanted beer with flavor. Complexity. Character. Intensity. Not words found in the mass market lexicon.\r\n\r\nSo with a banjo burner, a bunch of industrial kitchen sized pots and as many buckets as we could find, we jumped in feet first. Once a week, every week. We tried to emulate the beers we liked, but soon we were adding a little of this, or some of that and after a while we started having a hard time pegging our beer in a style category. Our first success was a Porter that was mainly porter, slightly stout. We ran it blind with our friends against the porters we liked and people liked it. \"We're on to something\", we thought. Twenty iterations, modifications and tweaks later it is Distorter, and is still our favorite beer.\r\n\r\nThis led to twice a week brewing and handing out bottle after bottle to everyone we knew. Along the way we screwed up a wheat beer by accidentally making it into sort of a copper ale with a few too many hops. And so Red Bud Ale was born. We had some extra noble hops and threw them in the IPA, and with some tinkering we most certainly had a one-of-a-kind IPA. You get the picture. All of this has firmly cemented our \"anything goes\" approach to beer making. Our inability to ever get quite within the style guidelines means we may never win an award, but we're ok with that.\r\n\r\nNow, several years later and with a 90% super-cool\/10% Rube Goldberg 7 bbl version of our banjo burner and kitchen pots, we're befuddling the beer judges and converting the masses. One pint at a time.\r\n\r\nStop in the storefront and try our mainstays, seasonals and small-batch runs. Not to mention our lab beers, where we continue to screw up one thing or another in search of the next great beer.","website":"http:\/\/www.greenbushbrewing.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QJRQhZ\/upload_8f50pf-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:19:53","locations":[{"id":"AlhRYb","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"5885 Sawyer Rd.","locality":"Sawyer","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49125","phone":"269-405-1076","website":"http:\/\/www.greenbushbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sunday - Thursday: 12-8\r\nFriday and Saturday: 12-10","latitude":41.8856286,"longitude":-86.5946671,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"zEE4b0","name":"Exorcism at Sunset","nameDisplay":"Exorcism at Sunset","description":"Imperial oatmeal milk stout aged in bourbon barrels.","abv":"12.5","glasswareId":8,"availableId":3,"styleId":16,"isOrganic":"Y","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/zEE4b0\/upload_c5EYzT-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/zEE4b0\/upload_c5EYzT-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/zEE4b0\/upload_c5EYzT-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-06-19 15:35:44","updateDate":"2015-12-18 02:17:57","glass":{"id":8,"name":"Tulip","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":3,"name":"Not Available","description":"Beer is not available."},"style":{"id":16,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"British-Style Imperial Stout","shortName":"British Imperial Stout","description":"Dark copper to very dark brown, British-style imperial stouts typically have high alcohol content.

So, for example, if we say a beer will taste like peanut butter and jelly, you can be sure you\u2019ll smell and taste the fresh roasted peanuts and fruity berry jam. Our flagship beers such as Hop Gun IPA and Floridian Hefeweizen, also strive towards big, bold flavor. It\u2019s who we are.\r\n\r\nOur Brewery is located in the heart of Oakland Park\u2019s new Culinary Arts District. The 20,000 sq-ft facility is powered by a 30-barrel, three-piece brewhouse, which feeds nearly 1000 gallons of beer per batch into our four 60-barrel fermenters - a capacity that makes us South Florida\u2019s largest craft microbrewery. Each of our distinctive beers is brewed using the finest, all-natural ingredients, then served up unpasteurized, unfiltered, and unfussed with. We offer tours of our 20,000 sq-ft facility, rotating food trucks nightly, and growlers of our brewery fresh beer to-go.\r\n\r\nYou can sample our creations in our spacious tap room - open 7 days a week, noon to midnight - as well as in bars and restaurants all across South Florida. And of course, we still brew at our original location in Boca Raton, the Funky Buddha Brewery & Lounge, which has become a test kitchen for our more experimental brews.\r\n\r\nSee you soon for a pint!

Imperial Stout is the beer was originally developed for the Tsar's court in St. Petersburg. Petersburg. In the 1800s, this beer very popular. The beer bryggedes in England and sailed to Russia. In order to withstand the long journey was done beer extra strong compared to the Stout, sold in England. The beer was drained often champagne bottles.\r\n\r\nThe high alcohol content of 8% is to ensure the durability of the black beer. There used unrefined cane sugar from Mauritius as extra flavoring. Most English ales are brewed with unrefined cane sugar. By using unrefined sugar, you get tasting notes from cane sugar in the finished beer. The color is in the bright end of the scale. On the other hand, there is no added caramel color in this Stout!\r\n\r\n The taste of Aarhus Brewery Stout is thick and bold. Although it is a strong beer, it is not the hops that are dominant. This makes it easier to access than many other black beer. There is also a slight sweetness from cane sugar that is balanced with the hops. In time, hop bitterness subside, and the sweetness will dominate.\r\n\r\nThe young Stout will be a good companion to a piece of dark meat or a heavy casserole. It will certainly be obvious to drink for Christmas War or pork roast. Danish Yule developed over centuries, where we always have been drinking beer. Therefore suitable beer is just better to Danish cuisine.\r\n\r\nAarhus Brewery Stout will also be an excellent companion for all cheeses. Try to serve bread with cheese. Bread and Stouten will lift and compliment the cheeses.\r\n\r\nServing temperature of Aarhus Brewery Stout allowed to be about 10 degrees. It does not matter that the further warmed in the glass, it can easily tolerate.\r\n\r\nIn time, hop bitterness removable and sweetness will dominate. In about 2 years, Stout be an exciting companion to a strong chocolate cake!\r\n\r\nSave a box, forget it and enjoy! But do not wait too long. by saving it dark and cool, it is not unlikely that it will keep for years.","abv":"8","glasswareId":5,"availableId":1,"styleId":16,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/fahZRo\/upload_qcCK2V-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/fahZRo\/upload_qcCK2V-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/fahZRo\/upload_qcCK2V-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-12-15 14:48:57","updateDate":"2015-12-16 23:05:32","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":16,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"British-Style Imperial Stout","shortName":"British Imperial Stout","description":"Dark copper to very dark brown, British-style imperial stouts typically have high alcohol content.

It produces several beers under various brand names that come to you with the utmost care and quality that we can.\r\n\r\nAs we only use particular beer ingredients, barley, hops, yeast and water, we obtain an end product which distinguishes itself from the soda flavor, the aroma, the gas and until the foam.\r\n\r\nWe also do not filter out our beer as it removes the same properties and with sterilization eliminates any living yeast. Did you know that in ancient times beer was the safest way to drink water? This is because beers have a long duration without spoiling due to microorganisms responsible for fermentation yeasts. These can overlap with agents that invade their surroundings, beer, killing them. Due to the lower alcohol content does not lead to dehydration as much as other alcoholic beverages. Thus one Brew is valid for drinking from about 1 year. The most interesting is that adequately conditioned beers, depending on the style, last up to five or even more years in the most extreme cases. Our all beers last more than 1 year but because the properties change with time, to better almost always guarantee only that period to enjoy what described on the label.\r\n\r\nHow do fermentation in the bottle always guarantee that the beer will live yeast to the consumer, which on the one hand clears the beer and the other creates gas in it. Because of this fermentation in the bottle our beers have always deposit.
