After ending up on the wrong side of the tracks a few times, they were finally pointed in the direction of Virginia-Highlands and found a few bars willing to take a chance on them. \"We'll give you a shot as long as your dog stops begging for leftovers on our patio\" was the cautious approval they needed to get the brand rolling.\r\n\r\nSweetWater's second and current location is in Midtown Atlanta, adjacent to Ansley Park, in the Armour Circle Industrial Park just off of Piedmont and Monroe. The boys saved all of their pennies to buy the 25,000 square feet of brewing goodness and smack in the middle of all the action. Since the company began we've wanted to be closer to our homes, the bars and stores that sell our beer, and all the good folks that drink it. Fortunately seven years of great growth gave the company that opportunity. We learned a lot from that location and left all those mistakes behind as we built our new home. SweetWater Brewing Company has been here since 2004 and it feels good to be settled in. Our new home has enough capacity to brew 100,000 barrels of beer a year (A few more years at this rate.)","website":"http:\/\/www.sweetwaterbrew.com\/","established":"1997","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TMc6H2\/upload_3il9e7-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TMc6H2\/upload_3il9e7-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TMc6H2\/upload_3il9e7-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TMc6H2\/upload_3il9e7-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TMc6H2\/upload_3il9e7-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:59:40","locations":[{"id":"MfINpl","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"195 Ottley Drive","locality":"Atlanta","region":"Georgia","postalCode":"30324","phone":"404-691-2537","website":"http:\/\/www.sweetwaterbrew.com\/","latitude":33.808102,"longitude":-84.38119,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1997","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"rGifX7","name":"2009 Holiday Ale","nameDisplay":"2009 Holiday Ale","description":"To celebrate the 2009 holidays, we made a special batch of our Tripel.

They also take time to push the limits of brewing with the \"Brick Mason\" series, which the staff sees as their continuing masterpiece. Highlights from this series include \"The Lost Years\" old ale, \"Black-Eye Rye\" American black ale, and the most recent release \"20th Anniversary\", a 10% Imperial stout that was aged in Buffalo Trace bourbon barrels. Early accolades have already compared it to the hallowed KBS.\r\n\r\nThe future keeps looking brighter and brighter for this brewery, and the next couple years will see them growing and experimenting with diverse styles, collaborating with fellow breweries, implementing a new barrel program, and continuing to raise the bar for themselves in all aspects.

Both had an entrepanerial passion, but never thought of a microbrewery as their business.  \"The decision was made for us.  Make a business out of something you love to do and you will never work another day in your life\" the couple states.  A lot of hard work and a love for good beer motivates the business. \r\nWe decided to open Eastern Shore Brewing after talking with friends from St. Michael's Winery, and were told that the town was in need of a microbrewery.  After some discussion (less than you may think), we agreed and were on our way.  With some trials along the way in year one, year two proved to be the pinicle of change.  An increase in brewery size promoted an increase of staff.  Randall Marquis came on board as brewmaster in March of 2009 and has made his presence known.  An undergratudate of Franklin Marshall College, and a brewing certificate holder from UC Davis, Randy is a large portion of the success of Eastern Shore Brewing.  Three beers took home medals in the Maryland Govenor's cup competition (Bronze for Lighthause Golden Ale, Silver for the Duck Duck Goose Porter and a Silver for the St.ichael's Amber ALe) on October 9th.  And although happy with the medals, Eastern Shore Brewing's goals are to continue to grow the busines and improve their products.  Distribution ranges from Cambridge to Kent Island on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, and recently moved into Ellicott City, Maryland.  A new fermenter will be arriving shortly after the new year, which will increase capacity even further.\r\nThere is more to come....","website":"http:\/\/www.easternshorebrewing.com\/","established":"2008","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/njjqaj\/upload_ZGz3Ti-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/njjqaj\/upload_ZGz3Ti-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/njjqaj\/upload_ZGz3Ti-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/njjqaj\/upload_ZGz3Ti-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/njjqaj\/upload_ZGz3Ti-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:45:05","locations":[{"id":"wW6rQJ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"605 S.

As usual, he took this move with seriousness and intensity . . . while having a blast!\r\n\r\nAfter researching the art of brewing, he discovered that contrary to the perceived image of brewers, the occupation required a variety of skills beyond drinking a lot. So, Jem decided to get a hospitality and management degree from F.I.U. in Florida and at the same time practiced and fine-tuned his brewing (and drinking) skills in his makeshift home brewery.\r\n\r\nThe next stop was a surprise- U.C. Davis in California to study Microbiology and The Advanced Sciences of Brewing. \u201cTo make perfect beer you need to understand the science of beer\u201d, he would convince himself during mind-numbing chemistry and advanced sanitation classes.\r\n\r\nTo further quench his thirst for brewing knowledge and skills, Jem upped the ante and applied to Chicago\u2019s Siebel Institute of Technology, the Mecca for beer industry education and way station for some of the world\u2019s renowned brew masters. However, to his amazement, he was rejected.\r\n\r\nRejection didn\u2019t stand in his way. Jem clenched his teeth and pushed forward understanding that to be accepted to the revered institute he would need some serious brewing experience. The next stop was as an assistant brewer at Oxford Brewing Company of Maryland. A year and a half and many bags of grain later, Jem was accepted to Siebel where he completed his academic studies, hung out with Budweiser and Coors Jr., and gained 10 kilos.\r\n\r\nArmed with a battery of diplomas and experience, Jem continued to execute his plan with determination. He immigrated to Israel with his wife, two kids, five thousand dollars, and a dream of producing premium fresh beer in the Holy Land.\r\n\r\nHere Dan came into the picture. Dan, a lawyer and entrepreneur originally from New York, heard about this strange pioneer with an overwhelming passion for beer and people, and was intrigued. The two met for a beer, the hops sparked and the deal was struck- Jem and Dan would establish a factory for fresh beer in Israel.\r\n\r\nWell, maybe it wasn\u2019t that easy. The journey was long and arduous, full of bureaucracy, business plans, searching for locations in dubious industrial zones, and mainly naysayers and skeptics who couldn\u2019t understand what these two Americans were trying to do.\r\n\r\nFinally, after extensive wanderings, they found an old factory in a dusty corner of Petach Tikva\u2019s industrial zone. Where others would have turned their backs, the two saw the potential and decided that the dream will turn to reality at number 15 Hamagshimim Street.","website":"http:\/\/www.jems.co.il\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/JDJ6aI\/upload_3n3UJ3-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/JDJ6aI\/upload_3n3UJ3-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/JDJ6aI\/upload_3n3UJ3-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/JDJ6aI\/upload_3n3UJ3-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/JDJ6aI\/upload_3n3UJ3-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-06-12 23:46:14","updateDate":"2016-06-28 14:49:30","locations":[{"id":"Onv9LT","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"15 Hamagshimim Street","locality":"Petah Tiqwa","region":"Hamerkaz","phone":"+972 3-919-5367","latitude":32.1800086,"longitude":34.8922451,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"IL","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-06-28 15:00:35","updateDate":"2016-06-28 15:00:50","country":{"isoCode":"IL","name":"ISRAEL","displayName":"Israel","isoThree":"ISR","numberCode":376,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"KeH3cx","name":"\u00c0 La Belge Triple","nameDisplay":"\u00c0 La Belge Triple","abv":"9.4","styleId":59,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-10-21 16:24:40","updateDate":"2012-10-21 16:24:41","style":{"id":59,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Tripel","shortName":"Belgian Tripel","description":"Tripels are often characterized by a complex, sometimes mild spicy character.

In 1991 the company took on a new challenge and moved into modern buildings while maintaining its traditional character and the quality of its products, qualified as \"grand crus\" by connoisseurs. An alliance of Modernity and Tradition!\r\nThese are the company's motto, a real creed for the managers at Brunehaut Brewery.\r\n\r\nTradition, because the traditional brewery retains the entirely natural brewing method for late fermentation beers and that are refermented in bottles and kegs. The result: a panel of about a dozen abbey or organic beers, all valuable and unique. To ensure that the link to the region remains strong, the types of barley used in the brewing process are grown in our own farm at Gaurain-Ramecroix.\r\n\r\nModern, because modern and high performance machinery ensure scrupulous compliance with hygiene regulations and a top quality production with consistent flavour. Also modern in how we deal with the market: several beers from Brunehaut won prizes at international competitions and are currently present in 25 different countries.\r\nMarc-Antoine De Mees and his staff are still equally enthusiastic to allow the discovery of this knowledge and method.\u2026","website":"http:\/\/www.brunehaut.com\/","established":"1890","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gOaK1T\/upload_ppmToE-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gOaK1T\/upload_ppmToE-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gOaK1T\/upload_ppmToE-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gOaK1T\/upload_ppmToE-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gOaK1T\/upload_ppmToE-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:40:35","locations":[{"id":"tpbOyx","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Rue de Panneries 17","locality":"Brunehaut","region":"Hainaut","postalCode":"7623","phone":"32-069-34-64-11","website":"http:\/\/www.brunehaut.com\/","latitude":50.5111769,"longitude":3.3891665,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"BE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"BE","name":"BELGIUM","displayName":"Belgium","isoThree":"BEL","numberCode":56,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"LwvX4x","name":"Abbey Triple","nameDisplay":"Abbey Triple","description":"A Belgian Trappist triple yeast culture balanced with the finest imported pale barley, Belgian aromatic malt and oats, gives this golden ale a fruity bouquet and a light refined taste.\r\n\r\nMalts: Aromatic, Oats, Pilsen\r\nHops: Goldings","abv":"8.4","ibu":"13","glasswareId":5,"availableId":1,"styleId":59,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/LwvX4x\/upload_gjEge1-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/LwvX4x\/upload_gjEge1-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/LwvX4x\/upload_gjEge1-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:38","updateDate":"2015-12-15 21:27:47","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":59,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Tripel","shortName":"Belgian Tripel","description":"Tripels are often characterized by a complex, sometimes mild spicy character.
