Today we brew, bottle and keg our beers from our new home in the historic La Crosse Footwear building with our expanded 30 barrel brewery.

The philosophy was to bring an appreciation of craft beer to the north with product education and creativity.  The process of appreciation through education we call beer liberation.\r\n\r\nToday Short\u2019s Brewing Company continues the effort to educate and liberate consumers.  We take pride in our hands on, mom and pop approach and the energy we put into the quality of our beer, food, staff, customers and facilities. We believe in the power of the smallness.   We intend on remaining a smaller, state wide beer distributor and focusing our energies close to home (the SBC Michigan stimulus package).  Our goal is to get to a comfortable production volume, enjoy what we do and love life in Northern Michigan.","website":"http:\/\/www.shortsbrewing.com\/","established":"2004","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Oj9rBb\/upload_ljskfg-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2016-02-04 14:44:21","locations":[{"id":"CzopCY","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"121 North Bridge Street","locality":"Bellaire","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49615","phone":"231-533-6622","website":"http:\/\/www.shortsbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sun - Thu: 11:00 am \u2013 11:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:00 am - 12:00 am","latitude":44.976269,"longitude":-85.210357,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2004","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"hGxXqj","name":"Pekoe Tea Pale Ale","nameDisplay":"Pekoe Tea Pale Ale","description":"An experimental pale ale made with Black and Orange Pekoe tea.","abv":"5.2","styleId":25,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-24 11:11:14","updateDate":"2015-04-23 18:35:49","style":{"id":25,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"American Pale","description":"American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.

HBC features four initial microbrews with plans for up to twelve more to come.

All the equipment was removed and brought back to Lakewood, New York and set up at its new 10,000 square foot home, The Southern Tier Brewing Company. The Brewery began operations in February 2004 distributing regionally. By 2005 sales covered the majority of the New York State and the eastern half of Pennsylvania. In the beginning their two Flagship brands were a Pilsner and Mild Ale. Oh yeah they also brewed IPA! As it turned out the flagships were a flop and the IPA was a huge success. They next launched a line of seasonal beers which have gained great success. Since the beginning, Southern Tier has experienced steady growth, currently distributing to over 25% of the United States. Multiple expansions have been made to keep up with demand and the brewery continues to be innovative by producing new products.
