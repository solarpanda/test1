We've worked hard and are incredibly proud of the many successes we've enjoyed over the years. The Boston Beer Company has been cited as one of the best companies to work for by Boston Magazine, one of the Best Entry-Level Jobs by The Princeton Review, and our beers have won more awards than any other in history. Jim has been named an \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" by Inc. Magazine. Our brewers keep amazing us with innovative new brews, including Samuel Adams Utopias and our Samuel Adams Barrel Room Collection.\r\n\r\nJim has believed from the beginning that the more you know and understand about beer, the more you'll appreciate a beer like Samuel Adams Boston Lager. To begin that mission, all new employees go through intensive training on everything from ingredients, brewing, and beer styles, to taking care of the beer once it leaves the brewery. We're all beer lovers and protectors of the beer so we're trained how to identify off flavors and how to troubleshoot the causes. The passion for beer continues with an annual homebrew competition that we all take part in.\r\n\r\nOne of our wholesalers once asked Jim why he invested so much in training his people, when ultimately they might leave. Jim smiled and replied without hesitation: \"What if I didn't train them, and they stayed?\"\r\n\r\nEach year, usually in January, everyone gathers together. One of the highlights of the meeting is the beer trivia contest. With a culture so steeped in beer education and knowledge, winning is a pretty big deal. Recently, one of the hotel bartenders who was watching as the various teams arrived in costume with music and much enthusiasm and fanfare, said, \"I've always known Samuel Adams made the best beer in America, but now I see this is the greatest company in America.\" When you look around you see that The Boston Beer Company is a team of enthusiastic people who are passionate about beer and who really love coming to work every day to provide American drinkers with the best beer possible.\r\n\r\nThe Boston Beer Company, Inc. is a publicly-traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol, SAM.","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","established":"1984","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:24:45","locations":[{"id":"DF5YsC","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"30 Germania Street","locality":"Boston","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"02130","phone":"1-800-372-1131","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","latitude":42.314449,"longitude":-71.103365,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1984","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2015-12-02 19:22:03","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"MLUbXI","name":"Cincinnati","streetAddress":"1625 Central Parkway","locality":"Cincinnati","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45214","phone":"513-412-3200","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","latitude":39.1144986,"longitude":-84.5222061,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-12 13:10:57","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"XZ6L8a","name":"Production Brewery","streetAddress":"7880 Penn Drive","locality":"Breinigsville","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"18031","latitude":40.5759622,"longitude":-75.6290377,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2007","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-11-30 20:24:56","updateDate":"2015-12-02 19:22:03","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"7rp6lp","name":"Knip Pils","nameDisplay":"Knip Pils","glasswareId":4,"styleId":98,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/7rp6lp\/upload_WuM85M-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/7rp6lp\/upload_WuM85M-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/7rp6lp\/upload_WuM85M-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:33","updateDate":"2015-12-16 10:57:00","glass":{"id":4,"name":"Pilsner","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"style":{"id":98,"categoryId":8,"category":{"id":8,"name":"North American Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"American-Style Pilsener","shortName":"American Pilsener","description":"This classic and unique pre-Prohibition American-style Pilsener is straw to deep gold in color.

The brewery is named for the famed Clipper ship - first developed and built in the home port of Baltimore. While the name of the company remains Clipper City Brewing Company, all of its beer falls under the Heavy Seas brand. Heavy Seas is located at 4615 Hollins Ferry Road, Suite B, in the Halethorpe section of Baltimore. Heavy Seas currently offers a variety of beer styles in approx. 18 states within the United States.\r\n\r\nHeavy Seas mission is to bring back the local brewery, and to do it in such a way that we are more than just a fringe player, but a positive part of our area. To accomplish this mission we have created a broad portfolio of products with enough diversity that we have at least one beer that can appeal to everyone. Whether your preference is for a classic American style lager beer, or a big, challenging Hop Cubed Ale, we have a something that will suit your taste. We believe in bringing beer drinkers the quality and flavor of a handcrafted beer while supporting the local communities we serve.","website":"http:\/\/www.hsbeer.com\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wTFQaf\/upload_DPoml0-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wTFQaf\/upload_DPoml0-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wTFQaf\/upload_DPoml0-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wTFQaf\/upload_DPoml0-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wTFQaf\/upload_DPoml0-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:43:22","locations":[{"id":"yX6twV","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"4615-B Hollins Ferry Road","locality":"Baltimore","region":"Maryland","postalCode":"21227","phone":"410-247-7822","website":"http:\/\/www.hsbeer.com\/","latitude":39.230827,"longitude":-76.6751309,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2014-11-20 13:52:46","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"vh3ZUn","name":"Heavy Seas Alehouse - Baltimore","streetAddress":"1300 Bank Street","locality":"Baltimore","region":"Maryland","postalCode":"21231","phone":"(410) 753-1403","website":"http:\/\/heavyseasalehouse.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  4:00pm - 12:00am\nTue:  4:00pm - 12:00am\nWed:  4:00pm - 12:00am\nThu:  4:00pm - 12:00am\nFri:  12:00pm - 2:00am\nSat:  12:00pm - 2:00am\nSun:  11:00am - 12:00am\n\n","latitude":39.286626,"longitude":-76.598808,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"restaurant","locationTypeDisplay":"Restaurant\/Ale House","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-05-23 22:13:06","updateDate":"2014-11-20 13:51:07","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"gmfbj6","name":"Heavy Seas Alehouse - Arlington","streetAddress":"1501 Wilson Blvd","locality":"Arlington","region":"Virginia","postalCode":"22209","phone":"(703) 879-4388","website":"http:\/\/heavyseasalehouse.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  11:00am - 12:00am\nTue:  11:00am - 12:00am\nWed:  11:00am - 12:00am\nThu:  11:00am - 12:00am\nFri:  11:00am - 2:00am\nSat:  11:00am - 2:00am\nSun:  11:00am - 12:00am\n\n","latitude":38.8952016,"longitude":-77.0742466,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"restaurant","locationTypeDisplay":"Restaurant\/Ale House","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-11-20 13:52:30","updateDate":"2014-11-20 13:52:46","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"YAIxxy","name":"Lauterbacher Erbpils","nameDisplay":"Lauterbacher Erbpils","abv":"4.9","styleId":98,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-12 12:09:35","updateDate":"2014-10-09 17:31:31","style":{"id":98,"categoryId":8,"category":{"id":8,"name":"North American Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"American-Style Pilsener","shortName":"American Pilsener","description":"This classic and unique pre-Prohibition American-style Pilsener is straw to deep gold in color.

Our brewing process utilizes the traditional English method of upward infusion mashing in our combination mash lauter tun to create lagers and ales inspired by old world values, but with modern quality and consistency. The staff at The Lion Brewery is dedicated to producing true handcrafted beers, made right here in our century-old Brewhouse. All of our premium beers are made using only the four basic ingredients allowed by the Reinheitsgebot, or German purity law. Under the skillful supervision of our Master Brewer, Leo Orlandini, each of our lagers and ales are brewed in small batches using only the finest hops and malts available to guarantee the highest quality and freshness. Each product we brew is an original recipe especially created to deliver a fuller flavor than ordinary beers, yet with an approachable style and character. As a result, our beers have garnered numerous medals from the Great American Beer Festival and the World Beer Championships in recent years.\r\n\r\nIn 1974 the Lion Brewing Company bought the Stegmaier Brand.","website":"http:\/\/www.lionbrewery.com\/","established":"1857","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TwOeWu\/upload_VQOP01-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TwOeWu\/upload_VQOP01-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TwOeWu\/upload_VQOP01-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TwOeWu\/upload_VQOP01-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/TwOeWu\/upload_VQOP01-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:00","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:50:50","locations":[{"id":"z0gnmN","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"700 North Pennsylvania Blvd.","locality":"Wilkes Barre","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"18705","phone":"800-233-8327","website":"http:\/\/www.lionbrewery.com\/","latitude":41.2556575,"longitude":-75.858261,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1857","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:00","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"oJgnJo","name":"Little Bo Pivo","nameDisplay":"Little Bo Pivo","abv":"4.8","styleId":98,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-10-28 13:55:41","updateDate":"2015-10-28 13:55:41","style":{"id":98,"categoryId":8,"category":{"id":8,"name":"North American Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"American-Style Pilsener","shortName":"American Pilsener","description":"This classic and unique pre-Prohibition American-style Pilsener is straw to deep gold in color.

The brewery addition was added back in 1994 but operated quietly as Oregon\u2019s smallest micobrewery for many years. With the more recent additions of David Vohden and Cameron Moore, we have refocused our efforts on producing and sharing a constantly changing lineup of fresh quality beers from right here in the Great Pacific Northwest. Vohden oversees all brewery operations which he has met with great success. Most recently of which was a Silver Medal for our Woozy Weizenbock at the Great American Beer Festival. We see our recent efforts bringing exciting results.\r\n\r\nWe reached completion of a 3,500 sq ft. addition to expand our brew house in the Summer of 2013. Vohden and Moore finished installation of the glycol system just in time to quench the thirsty demands of the 2013 Oregon Brewers Festival with a crowd pleasing Traverse Cherry Wit Bier. In addition to the brew house expansion we have added four 7-barrel fermentation tanks for an eventual all around 7-barrel system upgrade. A Cellar was also added for barrel aging, sours, and other delectable experiments.\r\n\r\nAlthough most of the square footage was utilized for brewing purposes. We were sure to save some space for all you beer drinkers. A mezzanine gives an elevated view down onto the open brewery floor. If you happen to drop by on a brew day you too can enjoy the sweet sensory overload and watch the action (or lack thereof). A beautiful black walnut bar, fully stocked with 13 drafts faucets was added to accompany the additional seating area and to cater to private events. However, the new bar and brewery seating are always open to patrons except in the case of private events. Another 60\u2032 TV was added to the new mezzanine area and we continue to play all major sporting events.

While the small 5 gallon batches allowed for plenty of great experience, they yearned for more creative control.\r\n\r\nThe brewers decided it was time for a more professional three vessel system, giving them complete control over the brewing process. The 1\/2 barrel system gave the brewers a solid platform to refine and perfect a lineup of beers for the most discerning pallet. This led to the creation of several great recipes, and a roster of clean crisp beers. The original hobby transformed into a passion for sharing world-class hand crafted beers with those who would appreciate them. \r\n\r\nLevante Brewing currently brews on our 15 bbl production brewery system located in West Chester, PA.

EBC West opened June 1st, 2005 in the fun-filled college town of Fredonia, home to SUNY Fredonia.","website":"http:\/\/www.ellicottvillebrewing.com\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/c1ade9\/upload_AdfhAc-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/c1ade9\/upload_AdfhAc-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/c1ade9\/upload_AdfhAc-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/c1ade9\/upload_AdfhAc-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/c1ade9\/upload_AdfhAc-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:05:45","locations":[{"id":"xKgMb7","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"28A Monroe St","locality":"Ellicottville","region":"New York","postalCode":"14731","phone":"716-699-ALES","website":"http:\/\/www.ellicottvillebrewing.com\/","latitude":42.2751607,"longitude":-78.6708194,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"KElhLo","name":"Morimoto Imperial Pilsner","nameDisplay":"Morimoto Imperial Pilsner","description":"Imperial Pilsner, part of the Morimoto Signature Series, was launched in September 2003.

Rogue's first brewpub was located in Ashland, Oregon and was a 10bbl brewsystem. Rogue opened a second brewpub, 15bbl brewsystem, in May 1989 located in Newport, Oregon. Rogue closed its Ashland operation in 1997, after the great flood destroyed the place. In 1991, the 15bbl system, named Howard after John Maier's former boss, from the Newport brewpub was transferred across the bay to the current brewery and upgraded to a 30bbl system. In 1998 Rogue bought a 50bbl brewsystem, named Kobe. Kobe is the only brewsystem in use. Tours: We offer brewery tours every day at 3 pm (followed by a distillery tour at 4pm). Go up to the bar inside the brewery (Brewers on the Bay) and check in with the bartender and the tour will commence. Please call ahead if you have a large group and or to verify the tour time...Brewer's on the Bay phone is 541-867-3664.

Following fourteen months of design, building and construction they finally fired up the brew kettle for the first time in December of 1999. Although the brewery was tiny and tucked in a basement on Pearl Street, the celebration and Grand Opening was enough to attract throngs of flavor starved people and get Mayor Medinger to tap the inaugural keg.\r\n\r\nWe have come a long way since. Today we brew, bottle and keg our beers from our new home in the historic La Crosse Footwear building with our expanded 30 barrel brewery. The new brewery has over six times the brewing capacity of the old Pearl Street Brewhouse. And while we spent the first 8 years slinging brews out to nearby pubs and restaurants in draught kegs only, in July of 2007, we unveiled bottled beer in six packs and cases.","website":"http:\/\/www.pearlstreetbrewery.com\/brewin\/","established":"1999","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/LWD44j\/upload_dWVveA-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/LWD44j\/upload_dWVveA-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/LWD44j\/upload_dWVveA-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/LWD44j\/upload_dWVveA-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/LWD44j\/upload_dWVveA-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:05","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:54:21","locations":[{"id":"Y6z24E","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1401 Saint Andrew Street","locality":"La Crosse","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"54603","phone":"608-784-4832","website":"http:\/\/www.pearlstreetbrewery.com\/brewin\/","hoursOfOperation":"Tue - Fri: 4:00 pm - 8:00 pm\r\nSat: 12:00 pm - 5:00 am","latitude":43.834352,"longitude":-91.236154,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1999","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:05","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"ktfESP","name":"Ol' Factory","nameDisplay":"Ol' Factory","abv":"5","glasswareId":4,"availableId":1,"styleId":98,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/ktfESP\/upload_5GHg94-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/ktfESP\/upload_5GHg94-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/ktfESP\/upload_5GHg94-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-10-24 13:47:27","updateDate":"2015-12-16 19:43:21","glass":{"id":4,"name":"Pilsner","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":98,"categoryId":8,"category":{"id":8,"name":"North American Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"American-Style Pilsener","shortName":"American Pilsener","description":"This classic and unique pre-Prohibition American-style Pilsener is straw to deep gold in color.
