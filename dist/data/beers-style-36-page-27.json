Peter Egelston, Head Brewer in Northampton from 1987 until 1991, moved to Portsmouth to set up the new brewery here. (Egelston is now the sole proprietor of the Brewery.) \r\n\r\nThe brewing system consists of a custom made seven-barrel (210 gallons) JV Northwest brewhouse, two fourteen-barrel and three seven-barrel JV Northwest unitank (cylindroconical) fermenters, two fourteen-barrel horizontal fermenters (added later, in 1994), and twelve seven-barrel grundy cellar tanks. Originally, the Portsmouth Brewery opened with beer recipes from Northampton - Pale Ale, Old Brown Dog, Weizenheimer, Black Cat Stout, Blonde Ale, Golden and Amber Lagers - and these still comprise the core of the Brewery's full-time beers today. However, over the years, successive brewers have contributed many outstanding seasonal and specialty beers to the list.  All of the beers served at the Portsmouth Brewery are brewed right here on premise, with the exception of those beers, such as Shoals Pale Ale and Portsmouth Lager, brewed at Smuttynose Brewing Company, our sister company.","website":"http:\/\/www.portsmouthbrewery.com\/","established":"1991","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/4F7QA9\/upload_cq3hVs-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/4F7QA9\/upload_cq3hVs-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/4F7QA9\/upload_cq3hVs-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/4F7QA9\/upload_cq3hVs-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/4F7QA9\/upload_cq3hVs-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:55:06","locations":[{"id":"fKk5B1","name":"Main Brewpub","streetAddress":"56 Market Street","locality":"Portsmouth","region":"New Hampshire","postalCode":"03801","phone":"1-603-431-1115","website":"http:\/\/www.portsmouthbrewery.com\/","latitude":43.0780069,"longitude":-70.7575978,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1991","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2014-09-26 13:50:01","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"n6MXWq","name":"Williams Gold","nameDisplay":"Williams Gold","description":"Exactly what it says on the label; golden in colour with a zesty, hoppy aroma and clean refreshing flavours.

Beer was the mission, and liberation was the movement.  With a lot of elbow grease, blind ambition and a little luck, the quest to create a community pub in Northwest Lower Michigan began to take shape.  The philosophy was to bring an appreciation of craft beer to the north with product education and creativity.  The process of appreciation through education we call beer liberation.\r\n\r\nToday Short\u2019s Brewing Company continues the effort to educate and liberate consumers.  We take pride in our hands on, mom and pop approach and the energy we put into the quality of our beer, food, staff, customers and facilities. We believe in the power of the smallness.   We intend on remaining a smaller, state wide beer distributor and focusing our energies close to home (the SBC Michigan stimulus package).

Like all breweries, we use grain to make our beer. But unlike other breweries, we do not simply discard our used or \"spent\" grain. Instead, we deliver our spent grain to local farmers to use as feed for livestock and compost to enrich the soil for vegetables. We then, in turn, purchase this well-fed livestock and nutrient-rich vegetables to make our steaks, burgers, salads, side dishes and so many other items on our menu.\r\n\r\nOur goal is not only to bring you the freshest, most flavorful food and beer possible, but also to aim as high as we can for true sustainability.","website":"http:\/\/www.nevinsbrewing.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/vM3y9r\/upload_9O198w-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/vM3y9r\/upload_9O198w-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/vM3y9r\/upload_9O198w-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/vM3y9r\/upload_9O198w-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/vM3y9r\/upload_9O198w-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-01-05 15:25:50","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:39:48","locations":[{"id":"OR1ggJ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"12337 South Rt. 59","locality":"Plainfield","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60585","phone":"(815) 436-3900","website":"http:\/\/www.nevinsbrewing.com\/","latitude":41.656777,"longitude":-88.202701,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-01-05 15:26:36","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"zdkiYl","name":"Young\u2019s London Gold","nameDisplay":"Young\u2019s London Gold","description":"Young\u2019s London Gold is key member of the Young\u2019s range.

The Company is based in Eshowe, Zululand where Zulu Blonde Beer was originally brewed. The Zululand Brewery's flagship beer Zulu Blonde was launched internationally in 2010 where owner and brewmaster Richards Chennells brewed Zulu Blonde Export Ale at Marstons Brewery in Burton-upon-Trent in the UK to supply 800 pubs for the JDWetherspoons International REAL ALE FESTIVAL. Out of 50 different ales Zulu Blonde was voted number 1 and sold out in the first week of the three week festival. The Zululand brewmaster was invited back to the UK but this time brewed another 120 000 pints of the golden nectar at Everards brewery in Leicester to supply the 800 odd pub chain in time for the World Cup Kick off. Richard repeated the JDW REAL ALE FESTIVAL gig in 2012 where he brewed 100 000 pints at Caledonian Brewery in Edinburgh for what is known as the biggest Real Ale festival in the World. To date Zulu Blonde has sold over 330 000 pints of Zulu Blonde throughout the UK.
