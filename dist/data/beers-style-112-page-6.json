With an eye toward preserving and growing one-of-a-kind craft beers and brands, CBA was joined by Kona Brewing Company in 2010.\r\nWhen Kurt & Rob Widmer founded Widmer Brothers Brewing in 1984, they didn\u2019t confine their brewing exploration to strict style guidelines. To this day, Widmer Brothers continues to create handcrafted beers with a unique and unconventional twist on traditional styles that are award winning and please a wide range of craft beer lovers.\r\n\r\nRedhook began in a Seattle transmission shop in 1981, and those colorful roots are reflected in the brand\u2019s personality to this day. As one of the country\u2019s first craft breweries, Redhook continues to offer sessionable craft beers to consumers across the country.\r\n\r\nKona Brewing was founded in 1994 by the father and son team of Cameron Healy and Spoon Khalsa, who dreamed of crafting fresh, local island brews with spirit, passion and quality. As the largest craft brewery in Hawaii, Kona personifies the laid-back, passionate lifestyle and environmental respect of the people and culture of Hawaii.","website":"http:\/\/craftbrew.com\/","established":"2008","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Rg7sL4\/upload_gDCYfo-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Rg7sL4\/upload_gDCYfo-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Rg7sL4\/upload_gDCYfo-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Rg7sL4\/upload_gDCYfo-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Rg7sL4\/upload_gDCYfo-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:26:41","locations":[{"id":"NqX68g","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"929 North Russell Street","locality":"Portland","region":"Oregon","postalCode":"97227","phone":"503-331-7270","website":"http:\/\/craftbrewers.com\/","latitude":45.541038,"longitude":-122.6765558,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"buuCTR","name":"Cataqua Public House","streetAddress":"35 Corporate Dr","locality":"Portsmouth","region":"New Hampshire","postalCode":"03801","phone":"(603) 430-8600","website":"http:\/\/redhook.com\/","latitude":43.0861206,"longitude":-70.8044708,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"macro","locationTypeDisplay":"Macro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-12-20 18:42:45","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"bPegqO","name":"Redhook Brewery","streetAddress":"14300 NE 145th Street","locality":"Woodinville","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98072","phone":"(425) 483-3232","website":"http:\/\/www.redhook.com","latitude":47.7348275,"longitude":-122.1488713,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-01-03 15:21:29","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"F89U7N","name":"Harvest Wheat","nameDisplay":"Harvest Wheat","description":"It\u2019s a sweet brown wheat.

Chris Hunt and Duncan Guy began their brewing education in the Barley Mob Brewers homebrewing club and continued to search for unique and distinctive ale and lager formulas. They decided to offer their creations to the public through a small batch microbrewery in 2006.  Soon thereafter, award-winning brewer Courtney Tyvand joined the two and presented his smoked porter at the brewery\u2019s first beer dinner in October of 2006.\r\n\r\nThe brewery is located on the ground floor of a historic building at 4015 Tennessee Avenue in St. Elmo.  The building is constructed of foot-square cedar timbers and two-foot thick walls made of granite stone and mortar.  Built in 1911 as a packaging factory for K-Rations for WWI, we occasionally find artifacts from that era in the building walls and ceiling.  The brewery shares space with the Chattanooga U-Brew, a brew-on-premises business owned by Greg McCort. \r\n\r\nMBBC is proud to offer small batch specialty ales and lagers in kegs of various sizes.  A tasting room is part of the brewery; samples of our beers can be tasted and tested on premises.  Occasionally we have tasting events or tapping events at the brewery or at a nearby bar or restaurant.

Its effervescent head, delicate tangy taste, and crisp clear finish make it a refreshing, thirst quenching delight. High Rollers Wheat Beer can be enjoyed alone or with a slice of lemon. Excellent as an aperitif or with lighter fare, such as gazpacho, salads, or sushi. Unlike most cloudy wheat beers, this unique brew is sparklingly clear and has been known to win over even the most ardent domestic beer and wine fans. Best when served in a tall pilsner-style glass.\r\n\r\nHigh Rollers Wheat Beer won the Gold Medal at the 2000 Great American Beer Festival, in the American-Style Wheat Ale category, and has several other medals, as well.\r\n\r\nAs with all of our products, High Rollers Wheat Beer is never sterile filtered nor heat pasteurized, and should be stored in refrigeration.

Rogue's first brewpub was located in Ashland, Oregon and was a 10bbl brewsystem. Rogue opened a second brewpub, 15bbl brewsystem, in May 1989 located in Newport, Oregon. Rogue closed its Ashland operation in 1997, after the great flood destroyed the place. In 1991, the 15bbl system, named Howard after John Maier's former boss, from the Newport brewpub was transferred across the bay to the current brewery and upgraded to a 30bbl system. In 1998 Rogue bought a 50bbl brewsystem, named Kobe. Kobe is the only brewsystem in use. Tours: We offer brewery tours every day at 3 pm (followed by a distillery tour at 4pm). Go up to the bar inside the brewery (Brewers on the Bay) and check in with the bartender and the tour will commence. Please call ahead if you have a large group and or to verify the tour time...Brewer's on the Bay phone is 541-867-3664.

These beers are typically served with the yeast in the bottle, and are cloudy when served.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"35","abvMin":"3.5","abvMax":"5.5","srmMin":"4","srmMax":"10","ogMin":"1.036","fgMin":"1.006","fgMax":"1.018","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:42:48"},"breweries":[{"id":"mJEOcA","name":"North High Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"North High","description":"Award winning craft brewery located in Columbus, OH.","website":"http:\/\/www.northhighbrewing.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/mJEOcA\/upload_VOdj4s-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/mJEOcA\/upload_VOdj4s-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/mJEOcA\/upload_VOdj4s-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/mJEOcA\/upload_VOdj4s-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/mJEOcA\/upload_VOdj4s-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-01-05 15:34:51","updateDate":"2016-06-27 12:21:06","locations":[{"id":"FOC78c","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1288 N High St.","locality":"Columbus","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"43201","phone":"(614) 407-5278","website":"http:\/\/www.NorthHighBrewing.com","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Fri: 12:00 pm - 2:00 am\r\nSat - Sun: 11:00 am - 2:00 am","latitude":39.9886815,"longitude":-83.0054302,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2013-01-05 15:35:24","updateDate":"2015-06-11 14:51:44","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"0fjfSD","name":"North High Brewing Taproom","streetAddress":"1288 N.
