Tim's background in brewing started in his college days at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. In early 1993, his roommate at the time introduced him to the art of making beer. This smalltime hobby of making beer in a tiny apartment blossomed into a fulltime career, brewing commercially. Towards the end of 1993, Tim attended UC Davis in Northern California to study Fermentation Science. Upon returning to Salt Lake, he aligned himself with a startup brewery called Uinta Brewing Company. The concept for this startup was to brew the freshest beer available in the State of Utah while limiting the alcohol percentage to 3.2 by weight (4% by volume). It was wildly successful, providing locally made beer for the ski areas and the many tourists that visited Utah.","website":"http:\/\/tenayacreek.com\/","established":"1999","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/MSB2i0\/upload_sTNcTl-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/MSB2i0\/upload_sTNcTl-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/MSB2i0\/upload_sTNcTl-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/MSB2i0\/upload_sTNcTl-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/MSB2i0\/upload_sTNcTl-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2016-06-27 12:20:00","locations":[{"id":"HtFqFO","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"831 W Bonanza Rd","locality":"Las Vegas","region":"Nevada","postalCode":"89106","phone":"702-362-7335","website":"http:\/\/tenayacreek.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Daily: 11:00 a.m. to 2:00 a.m.\r\nClosed on Independence Day, Thanksgiving and Christmas.","latitude":36.176722,"longitude":-115.15317,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1999","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2016-06-28 13:35:55","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"VYkTqJ","name":"Belgian Witbier","nameDisplay":"Belgian Witbier","styleId":65,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-06-15 17:51:59","updateDate":"2016-06-15 17:51:59","style":{"id":65,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style White (or Wit) \/ Belgian-Style Wheat","shortName":"Witbier","description":"Belgian white ales are very pale in color and are brewed using unmalted wheat and malted barley and are spiced with coriander and orange peel.

Eric and Tim quickly realized that this is an excercise in futility, but along the way, their steadfast persistence and the quest to make a truly satisfying beer has resulted in countless hours of research and experimentation. While the small 5 gallon batches allowed for plenty of great experience, they yearned for more creative control.\r\n\r\nThe brewers decided it was time for a more professional three vessel system, giving them complete control over the brewing process. The 1\/2 barrel system gave the brewers a solid platform to refine and perfect a lineup of beers for the most discerning pallet. This led to the creation of several great recipes, and a roster of clean crisp beers. The original hobby transformed into a passion for sharing world-class hand crafted beers with those who would appreciate them. \r\n\r\nLevante Brewing currently brews on our 15 bbl production brewery system located in West Chester, PA. We are servicing several local restaurants, pubs and distributers. Levante aims to deliver a variety of creative brews to beer lovers in Philadelphia's western suburbs and beyond.","website":"http:\/\/www.levantebrewing.com\/","established":"2015","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/fAiQPx\/upload_VMqSfg-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/fAiQPx\/upload_VMqSfg-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/fAiQPx\/upload_VMqSfg-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/fAiQPx\/upload_VMqSfg-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/fAiQPx\/upload_VMqSfg-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-10-19 12:29:07","updateDate":"2016-05-04 20:50:59","locations":[{"id":"niIUKb","name":"Levante Brewing Company","streetAddress":"208 Carter Dr","extendedAddress":"Suite 2","locality":"West Chester","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"19382","latitude":39.9489353,"longitude":-75.5879947,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-10-19 12:30:17","updateDate":"2015-10-19 17:57:19","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"zkxVrP","name":"Biere Blanche","nameDisplay":"Biere Blanche","abv":"4.8","ibu":"13","glasswareId":5,"styleId":65,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:48","updateDate":"2012-03-22 13:05:29","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"style":{"id":65,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style White (or Wit) \/ Belgian-Style Wheat","shortName":"Witbier","description":"Belgian white ales are very pale in color and are brewed using unmalted wheat and malted barley and are spiced with coriander and orange peel.

No shortcuts, no artifice. We\u2019re true to the craft because we honor traditions of workmanship perfected by centuries of well-trained hands.\r\n\r\nThe Fidelis Philosophy took root in the fertile soil of Shawnee-On-Delaware, Pennsylvania. Our village, bounded by wooded hills on one side and the Delaware River on the other, enjoys a mild and varied climate, plenty of water and sun, abundant plants and wildlife and friendly, talented people. We are captivated by this nature and its possibilities. And our location- less than 100 miles from both New York City and Philadelphia- makes it only natural for us to broadly share the Fidelis Philosophy.\r\n\r\nIn a world of mass-production, our products are handmade. In a world of homogeneity, our products represent a defiant individuality. In a world without roots, our products embody a tangible sense of place. We aspire to eat what we grow, to drink what we brew, and to build what we use.

Under-qualified and unprepared, they started their journey with a Sherpa, a donkey, and a suitcase full of contraband. Naturally, half way through the trip the contraband was gone and the Sherpa and donkey had run off, leaving George and his group to fend for themselves. Luckily, everyone managed to make it off the mountain alive, and with a new outlook on life.\r\n\r\nHorn Dog Denver Colorado BeerLike any good beer drinker would at the end of an experience like that, George and his group found a local Pakistani hotel bar to have a drink in.

George gladly signed away and got down to some serious drinking.

The light tartness in the finish makes it the perfect beer to quench your thirst after a hard days work.\r\n\r\nLiterally translated to \u201cthe white of Grace\u201d, this beer has been a favorite of Grace\u2019s from the time it was first homebrewed several years ago. Over the years, the spicing in the recipe has undergone constant refinement to the point where the spices now serve to compliment the soft, wheaty character of the malt instead of dominate it. As with many of our beers, we prefer to subtly tease you with the spices instead of bashing you over the head with them.

Located at the corner of Broadway and Ottawa Streets it is the oldest working commercial building in Toledo. Our Brew Masters bring excellence in brewing and culinary experience to our craft beers. We transfer the same strength, creativeness, size, uniqueness and complexity of the architecture of the Oliver House to the artistry of our craft beer. No other brewery in the country brews under such history. With additional holding tanks and a bottling line located directly across the street at 28 Broadway, MBBCo's process requires great attention to detail and is very labor intensive. This delicate care sets our final product apart from other mass-produced brewing competitors.\r\n\r\nThroughout the year we have 7 beers on tap at the Maumee Bay Brew Pub, including the historical Buckeye Beer. Additionally, our beers are available at all of the restaurants in the historic Oliver House.
