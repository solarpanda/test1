In this era the PRIVAT-BRAUEREI HEINRICH REISSDORF \u2013 then called OBERG\u00c4RIGE BRAUEREI HEINRICH REISSDORF (TOP-FERMENTING BEWERY) \u2013 was founded in the Cologne quarter \u201cSeverinsviertel\u201d in 1894. Its founder, Heinrich Rei\u00dfdorf, derived from an old-established farmer family who were based in Zieverich \u2013 today a quarter of Bergheim\/Erft \u2013 as farriers and coach builders. A few years later, in 1905, the name K\u00f6lsch was established for the top-fermented Cologne beer-speciality. Before, it was called \u201cWiess\u201d. After Heinrich\u2019s death on 25.02.1901, Gertrud Rei\u00dfdorf managed the brewery until 1908. The continuance of the company had never been in danger, though, since the Rei\u00dfdorf couple had five sons, Johann Hubert, Heinrich, Hermann, Friedrich and Carl Rei\u00dfdorf.\r\n\r\nWhen the product range was diversified to further styles of beer \u2013 M\u00e4rzen, Export (both a strong variation of Lager) and Pilsen \u2013 in 1923 the top-fermenting brewery was renamed to BRAUEREI HEINRICH REISSDORF \u2013 OHG. In 1917, when the men had gone fighting in World War I, Friedrich\u2019s wife Katharina managed the brewery. The two had three sons: Heinrich Rei\u00dfdorf, who was killed in an accident in the brewery in 1936; and the two proprietors Hermann-Josef and Karl-Heinz, who died in 1996 and 1997. They led the company through economically difficult times after World War II, when the brewery was destroyed to the extent of 90%. Against all odds, the two brothers managed to produce and bottle a \u201cEinfachbier\u201d (literally: simple beer) with 2-4% vol. alc. Today the business is continued in the fourth generation.\r\n\r\nDue to a prosperous development of the PRIVAT-BRAUEREI HEINRICH REISSDORF, a new site for the brewery had to be found within the boundaries of the city of Cologne. Therefore, the company purchased premises in an industrial park in Cologne-Rodenkirchen. With the new production facility, a brewery with most modern brewing technology was built, which meets the highest quality criteria.\r\n\r\nContinuity and a sense for the necessary are the virtues which make possible to look back on 110 years of an existing PRIVAT-BRAUEREI HEINRICH REISSDORF. The ongoing success and the positioning of the PRIVAT-BRAUEREI HEINRICH REISSDORF in the highly competitive K\u00f6lsch-sector confirm this corporate philosophy imposingly.","website":"http:\/\/www.reissdorf.de","established":"1894","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:48","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:41:11","locations":[{"id":"tKLtLu","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Emil-Hoffmann-Strae 4-10","locality":"Kln","region":"Nordrhein-Westfalen","phone":"49-(0)2236-\/-9655-0","latitude":50.87533,"longitude":6.99444,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:48","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"9S2pDx","name":"Release The Monkeys","nameDisplay":"Release The Monkeys","description":"Banana K\u00f6lsch","abv":"4","ibu":"7","availableId":4,"styleId":45,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-12-04 15:37:45","updateDate":"2015-12-04 15:37:45","available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":45,"categoryId":4,"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"German-Style K\u00f6lsch \/ K\u00f6ln-Style K\u00f6lsch","shortName":"K\u00f6lsch","description":"K\u00f6lsch is warm fermented and aged at cold temperatures (German ale or alt-style beer).

Of course, they couldn't do it by themselves, so after very little convincing, they got roommate and friends, Mark Sinclair and Will Rafferty to join them.\r\n\r\nOn Father's Day in 1999, after almost two years of planning and preperation, the first batch of Hurricane Amber Ale was brewed. By July 2nd the first kegs had been shipped to three Newport Restaurants and were quickly tapped and emptied. A little over a month after the release of the first kegs, 6-packs of Hurricane Amber Ale began to hit the shelves.

Both had been home brewing for years, and started brewing together in their back yards in the summer of 2010. The goal of the first brews was to make enough beer for Nate\u2019s upcoming wedding. In the ensuing months the two continued brewing on a regular basis, creating better beers, refining the equipment and process and devising some great new recipes. As they continued to brew together, talk turned to the idea of an eventual commercial venture.\r\n\r\nTJ, a mutual friend of the two brewers noted that he could provide some equipment to allow for some larger brewing projects. Having this greater capacity led to the realization, that as much fun as it might be to try, the three of them would not be able to drink nearly as much as they were certain to produce and the beer would have to be shared with the public. The wheels were officially set in motion to make the jump from hobbyists to professional brewers.\r\n\r\nTo round out the team, the trio turned to some other friends. Drew had joined in on the occasional brewing session, and one of his creations took home a prize at a local brewing competition. Ron brought to the table the business and accounting skills needed to make this a business. Five friends who enjoyed hanging out together had just hit on the magic formula to turn fun into a business.\r\n\r\nBucket opened its pilot brewery in the Lorraine Mills in Pawtucket. The space was a 375 square foot room, and the equipment was largely retooled and designed to create a 1 BBL brewery. The first keg of beer went on tap in November 2012 and within a couple of months it was clear that the demand was huge and a bigger brewery would be needed.\r\n\r\nIn June of 2013, the pilot brewery closed and construction began on a full scale production brewery in August. Located in the mill at 545 Pawtucket Avenue, the new space was nearly 10 times larger at 3400 square feet. With a 10 BBL brewhouse, the production capacity grew ten-fold as well.\r\n\r\nIn the Fall of 2013, brewing began in the new facility and in November, Bucket Brewery was officially opened to the public. In addition to the kegs of beer that were the exclusive packaging in the pilot site, Bucket started shipping beer in 64oz and 32oz containers. The beer has beer very well received by our Rhode Island customers and the brewery continues to grow!\r\n\r\nBucket now holds tours and tastings every Saturday, as well as the Friday Night Sound Check music and art series, and other events.","website":"http:\/\/bucketbrewery.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ZB3WRj\/upload_a6AxDn-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ZB3WRj\/upload_a6AxDn-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ZB3WRj\/upload_a6AxDn-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ZB3WRj\/upload_a6AxDn-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ZB3WRj\/upload_a6AxDn-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-21 13:02:25","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:05:11","locations":[{"id":"PwIQok","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"545 Pawtucket Ave","locality":"Pawtucket","region":"Rhode Island","postalCode":"02860","website":"bucketbrewery.com","hoursOfOperation":"Friday 1:00-7:30 \r\nSaturday 11:00-5:00","latitude":41.859093,"longitude":-71.398175,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-21 13:02:26","updateDate":"2015-11-19 22:15:08","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"0Gtm5b","name":"Rick & Robbie's Spr\u00f6cket Bier - Stone Spotlight Series","nameDisplay":"Rick & Robbie's Spr\u00f6cket Bier - Stone Spotlight Series","description":"Rick and Robbie\u2019s Spr\u00f6cketbier is the first ever winner of the Stone Spotlight Series brewing competition.

We've worked hard and are incredibly proud of the many successes we've enjoyed over the years. The Boston Beer Company has been cited as one of the best companies to work for by Boston Magazine, one of the Best Entry-Level Jobs by The Princeton Review, and our beers have won more awards than any other in history. Jim has been named an \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" by Inc. Magazine. Our brewers keep amazing us with innovative new brews, including Samuel Adams Utopias and our Samuel Adams Barrel Room Collection.\r\n\r\nJim has believed from the beginning that the more you know and understand about beer, the more you'll appreciate a beer like Samuel Adams Boston Lager. To begin that mission, all new employees go through intensive training on everything from ingredients, brewing, and beer styles, to taking care of the beer once it leaves the brewery. We're all beer lovers and protectors of the beer so we're trained how to identify off flavors and how to troubleshoot the causes. The passion for beer continues with an annual homebrew competition that we all take part in.\r\n\r\nOne of our wholesalers once asked Jim why he invested so much in training his people, when ultimately they might leave.

What was once office space is now a refuge for the craft beer enthusiast. With all the Three Floyds mainstays, seasonal offerings, special small batch beers and many guest beers it is a mecca for craft beer.

Our publicly-held brewery employs over 150 people who are as passionate about quality craft beer as Kurt & Rob themselves.\r\n\r\nWe opened the brewery in 1984, and built a new 40-barrel brewing system in our current Russell Street location in 1990. We've grown steadily ever since. In 1996, we completed installation of a state-of-the art 250-barrel brewhouse, bringing our capacity to 220,000 barrels per year. In 1996, for the first time in our brewery\u2019s history we also installed a bottling line, capable of producing 500 bottles per minute. In 2008 we added six new 1500-barrel fermentation tanks that increased our capacity to 450,000 barrels per year, and added a new keg filling line capable of filling 300 kegs per hour.","website":"http:\/\/www.widmer.com\/","established":"1984","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/8wcv7h\/upload_61693P-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/8wcv7h\/upload_61693P-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/8wcv7h\/upload_61693P-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/8wcv7h\/upload_61693P-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/8wcv7h\/upload_61693P-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:13","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:02:38","locations":[{"id":"SgctbA","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"929 North Russell Street","locality":"Portland","region":"Oregon","postalCode":"97227","phone":"503-281-2437","website":"http:\/\/www.widmer.com\/","latitude":45.540795,"longitude":-122.675594,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1984","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:13","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"H6oRvr","name":"Sonnenwendbier","nameDisplay":"Sonnenwendbier","abv":"4.7","styleId":45,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-12 12:00:03","updateDate":"2012-08-19 14:35:03","style":{"id":45,"categoryId":4,"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"German-Style K\u00f6lsch \/ K\u00f6ln-Style K\u00f6lsch","shortName":"K\u00f6lsch","description":"K\u00f6lsch is warm fermented and aged at cold temperatures (German ale or alt-style beer).
