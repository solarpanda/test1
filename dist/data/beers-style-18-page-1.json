The brewery addition was added back in 1994 but operated quietly as Oregon\u2019s smallest micobrewery for many years. With the more recent additions of David Vohden and Cameron Moore, we have refocused our efforts on producing and sharing a constantly changing lineup of fresh quality beers from right here in the Great Pacific Northwest. Vohden oversees all brewery operations which he has met with great success. Most recently of which was a Silver Medal for our Woozy Weizenbock at the Great American Beer Festival. We see our recent efforts bringing exciting results.\r\n\r\nWe reached completion of a 3,500 sq ft. addition to expand our brew house in the Summer of 2013. Vohden and Moore finished installation of the glycol system just in time to quench the thirsty demands of the 2013 Oregon Brewers Festival with a crowd pleasing Traverse Cherry Wit Bier. In addition to the brew house expansion we have added four 7-barrel fermentation tanks for an eventual all around 7-barrel system upgrade. A Cellar was also added for barrel aging, sours, and other delectable experiments.\r\n\r\nAlthough most of the square footage was utilized for brewing purposes. We were sure to save some space for all you beer drinkers. A mezzanine gives an elevated view down onto the open brewery floor. If you happen to drop by on a brew day you too can enjoy the sweet sensory overload and watch the action (or lack thereof). A beautiful black walnut bar, fully stocked with 13 drafts faucets was added to accompany the additional seating area and to cater to private events. However, the new bar and brewery seating are always open to patrons except in the case of private events. Another 60\u2032 TV was added to the new mezzanine area and we continue to play all major sporting events. Go Blazers!\r\n\r\nSome would say our legendary steak sandwiches and two dozen rotating taps are a match made in heaven. Please join us and stop by to see what\u2019s new!","website":"http:\/\/13virtuesbrewing.com\/","established":"1994","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/u99e3l\/upload_PPMtjD-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/u99e3l\/upload_PPMtjD-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/u99e3l\/upload_PPMtjD-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/u99e3l\/upload_PPMtjD-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/u99e3l\/upload_PPMtjD-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-04-28 22:15:43","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:08:13","locations":[{"id":"kb4Yt1","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"6410 SE Miwaukie Ave.","locality":"Portland","region":"Oregon","phone":"(503) 239-8544","latitude":45.4762533,"longitude":-122.6488352,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-05-05 15:08:23","updateDate":"2015-12-03 19:03:48","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"cf8LBF","name":"1812 Project","nameDisplay":"1812 Project","description":"Our imagined homage to an early 19th century porter brewed & blended by the Washington Brewery (located in DC's Navy Yard from 1805 -1836); this porter is a blend of 3 brews, each also inspired by historic offerings from the Washington Brewery, and each brewed from the same base recipe, but to varying strengths: 25% #1 - Strong Ale (6.7% abv; finished with brettanomyces), 37.5% #2 - x ale (8.5% abv),37.5% #3 - Table Beer (2.6% abv; soured with lactobacillus); crafted with traditional ingredients (Thomas Fawcett amber malt & molasses), classic American-grown cluster hops & Virginia-grown wheat; brewed in collaboration with local beer historian Michael Stein.","abv":"5.8","ibu":"36","glasswareId":8,"styleId":18,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","servingTemperature":"cool","servingTemperatureDisplay":"Cool - (8-12C\/45-54F)","createDate":"2015-04-13 13:07:58","updateDate":"2015-04-13 14:21:45","glass":{"id":8,"name":"Tulip","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"style":{"id":18,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Brown Porter","shortName":"Brown Porter","description":"Brown porters are mid to dark brown (may have red tint) in color.

We knew what we wanted to drink, but we needed some help actually brewing it. So we enlisted our first brewer, took over some warehouse space on the Boston waterfront, and began introducing fresh, local craft beer to Boston drinkers. We tried to do it in a way that captured the spirit of fun that had brought us to beer in the first place. From that warehouse, surrounded by fish companies on the docks of South Boston (neighboring what is now the Seaport District), we couldn\u2019t imagine that craft brewing would become what it has today.  \r\n\r\nWe still remember our days on the other side of the bar, and have spent as much time spreading the joy of beer drinking as we have focusing on recipes, ingredients, and brewing equipment. Hopefully our sense of gratitude is reflected in both the quality of the beer and the spirit of fun and enjoyment surrounding our beer and breweries. We invite all of you to visit our Boston brewery, where it all began, and our beautiful brewery in Windsor, Vermont.","website":"http:\/\/www.harpoonbrewery.com\/","established":"1986","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/RzvedX\/upload_AbOUmA-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/RzvedX\/upload_AbOUmA-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/RzvedX\/upload_AbOUmA-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/RzvedX\/upload_AbOUmA-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/RzvedX\/upload_AbOUmA-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:57","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:47:47","locations":[{"id":"AGRvvY","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"336 Ruth Carney Drive","locality":"Windsor","region":"Vermont","postalCode":"05089","phone":"802-674-5491","website":"http:\/\/www.harpoonbrewery.com\/","latitude":43.5130201,"longitude":-72.4016913,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1986","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:57","updateDate":"2014-10-06 15:45:55","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"9aSjFg","name":"Boston","streetAddress":"306 Northern Avenue","locality":"Boston","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"02210","phone":"1-888-HARPOON","website":"http:\/\/www.harpoonbrewery.com","latitude":42.3465,"longitude":-71.033843,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1986","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2014-09-26 14:01:43","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Tv8yQb","name":"9 to 5 Brown Porter","nameDisplay":"9 to 5 Brown Porter","description":"Toasty, malty, and sessionable, with notes of coffee and biscuits, this easy-drinking brown porter is great for 9 to 5 or any time!","abv":"4.8","styleId":18,"isOrganic":"Y","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-05-27 14:48:36","updateDate":"2015-05-27 14:48:36","style":{"id":18,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Brown Porter","shortName":"Brown Porter","description":"Brown porters are mid to dark brown (may have red tint) in color.

The craft beer industry was still in its infancy, with only a handful of brewpubs in existence in the Midwest. In his travels across Europe, beer-lover John Hall had enjoyed a distinctive local brew in each region he visited. Hall was convinced that Midwesterners could produce beers as good or better than those he\u2019d tasted in his travels. Living on the shore of the largest system of fresh water on the planet Earth, in a city with rapidly evolving tastes \u2013 John decided that his hometown, Chicago, would be the ideal place to do just that.\r\n\r\nThe key to building interest in craft beer, Hall decided, was to allow consumers to watch the brewing process \u2013 while providing them with the then-novel experience of enjoying a wide variety of distinctive beers that had been produced on-site. Hall wanted to not only cater to his customers\u2019 tastes, but to challenge them as well. Goose Island\u2019s brewers set to work crafting a diverse selection of unique beers \u2013 and on Friday, May 13, 1988 the Goose Island Brewpub was born.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that John was right; Chicagoans palates evolved rapidly once Goose Island\u2019s Brewpub opened its doors and introduced the city to distinctive craft beer. By 1995, the brewpub had become so popular that John Hall decided to open a larger brewery and bottling plant to keep up with demand. Finding still more room for growth, in 1999 Hall opened a second Goose Island Brewpub just a stone\u2019s throw away from historic Wrigley Field.\r\n\r\nToday, Goose Island continues to brew an innovative selection of over 50 craft beers at the brewpub, the best of which are then bottled at our Fulton Street brewery. Goose Island beers are now enjoyed in all 50 states and Europe.","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/APW1BC\/upload_cXyTHD-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:46:51","locations":[{"id":"S2n5TB","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1800 West Fulton Street","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60612","phone":"1-800-466-7363","website":"http:\/\/www.gooseisland.com\/","latitude":41.887107,"longitude":-87.6720969,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:56","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:33:51","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"D2gG2C","name":"Clybourn","streetAddress":"1800 North Clybourn Avenue","locality":"Chicago","region":"Illinois","postalCode":"60614","phone":"800-466-7363","latitude":41.9137242,"longitude":-87.65373,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1988","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:15","updateDate":"2014-09-11 10:32:55","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"5Jq5lZ","name":"Abandon All Hope","nameDisplay":"Abandon All Hope","abv":"7","styleId":18,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-02-29 16:38:43","updateDate":"2016-02-29 16:38:43","style":{"id":18,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Brown Porter","shortName":"Brown Porter","description":"Brown porters are mid to dark brown (may have red tint) in color.

Brewed differently every year to commemorate our anniversary, this year's Fluxus is a porter brewed with a blend of 2-row, coffee and chocolate malts with blood orange pulp and zest. It was hopped using Perle, Tettnang and Glacier varieties. It was then fermented with a Belgian Abbey yeast.\r\n\r\nThe resulting beer is dark brown in color with chocolate and roasted notes throughout the flavor and aroma. The blood orange has a subtle presence in the aroma and the zest expresses itself in the mouth-drying finish by leaving a lingering bitterness. This full bodied ale was the creation of Allagash brewer Patrick Saville, lover of heavy metal, beer and all things dark.\r\n\r\nAs part of our Tribute Series, Allagash proudly donates $1 per bottle sold to the Allagash Pediatric Nurses Scholarship at the Maine Medical Center.

From start to finish, he is a one-man operation. The former cabinetmaker is also a self-reliant Mainer through and through. He was originally an all-grain homebrewer who decided to take it to the next level when his friends expressed interest in his beers. He designed the 12-barrel brewing system himself and enlisted a local welder to help put it together. Hazen notes that when you live in Maine, you have to find some service to provide to others in order to survive. For him, brewing is the service he provides to his local community. Located in the rolling hills of Lincolnville, Maine, Andrew's is housed in a renovated farmhouse next to Hazen's home. Finding the brewery is more than half the battle. Have no fear, however, as everyone knows about Andrew's. Also, be aware that due to some thieving souls, the brewery no longer has any signage to announce its existence to the visiting public. The only indication that a brewery exists in the farmhouse are the occasional keg deliveries in Hazen's front yard. And Hazen hasn't been quick to replace the sign either. While he welcomes visitors, you have to remember to clear a path for the busy brewer. Like many other unsung small brewers, running his 5OO-barrel per year brewery is a seven day a week operation for Hazen. Watching Hazen run the brewery is a little like watching Willy Wonka run the Chocolate Factory. When I visit him during a bottling day, Hazen runs between the bottling line and the packaging supplies in a hurried yet methodical manner. He stands up bottles on the line, starts the machine, slides his way across the brewhouse to the packaging materials, and hand assembles the six-packs that will hold the soon-to-be bottled beer. Andrew's beer is straightforward, unassuming and entirely enjoyable. His product line includes the St. Nick Porter, the Northern Brown Ale, the English Pale Ale, and the summer seasonal Ruby's Golden Ale. A celebration of the Amarillo hop, Hazen's English Pale Ale is a delightfully balanced product that neither over or underwhelms the palate.  from beerscribe.com","website":"http:\/\/mainebrewersguild.org\/brewers\/andrews-brewing-company\/","established":"1992","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:38:44","locations":[{"id":"TaDE9V","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"353 High St","locality":"Lincolnville","region":"Maine","postalCode":"04849","phone":"(207) 763-3305","website":"http:\/\/www.mainebrewersguild.org\/andrews.php","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  7:00am - 4:00pm\nTue:  7:00am - 4:00pm\nWed:  7:00am - 4:00pm\nThu:  7:00am - 4:00pm\nFri:  7:00am - 4:00pm\nSat:  9:00am - 10:00am\n\nMon - Fri: 7:00 am - 4:00 pm\r\nSat: 9:00 am - 10:00 am","latitude":44.3139494,"longitude":-69.1336523,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1992","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2014-08-25 19:12:47","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"bCFF7k","name":"Angels With Filthy Souls","nameDisplay":"Angels With Filthy Souls","description":"OUR FIRST DARK OFFERING; THIS PORTER IS LACED WITH LACTOSE SUGAR TO BALANCE THE TREMENDOUS AMOUNTS OF AMARILLO HOPS CONTAINED WITHIN.","abv":"6.3","ibu":"1.059","availableId":4,"styleId":18,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-04-20 20:39:19","updateDate":"2015-04-20 20:39:19","available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":18,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Brown Porter","shortName":"Brown Porter","description":"Brown porters are mid to dark brown (may have red tint) in color.

South central Wisconsin is also the stomping grounds of the Beast of Bray Road, a werewolf-type creature that was sighted on numerous occasions in the early 1990s, and the Wild Man of La Grange, a strange character apprehended by local authorities in 1929.
