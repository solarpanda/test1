Our name is a fusion of 'brewery' with our family name, Rue.\r\n\r\nOur calling is to create beers with character and depth using the simplest and purest of means. We do not filter or pasteurize our beers. Most of our bottled beers gain carbonation through bottle conditioning, allowing carbonation to naturally occur through a secondary bottle fermentation. We strive to use unconventional ingredients, and we will proudly state what we put in our beers.","website":"http:\/\/www.thebruery.com\/","established":"2008","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/4MVtcc\/upload_5OYqW3-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/4MVtcc\/upload_5OYqW3-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/4MVtcc\/upload_5OYqW3-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/4MVtcc\/upload_5OYqW3-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/4MVtcc\/upload_5OYqW3-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:00:07","locations":[{"id":"st9day","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"715 Dunn Way","locality":"Placentia","region":"California","postalCode":"92870","phone":"714-996-6258","website":"http:\/\/www.thebruery.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Friday & Saturday: 4pm - 10pm\r\nSunday: 12pm - 6pm","latitude":33.8613833,"longitude":-117.8800107,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"PvKrJK","name":"Joy Division series #3: New Dawn Fades","nameDisplay":"Joy Division series #3: New Dawn Fades","description":"A dark farmhouse ale spiced with dried lemongrass and peppercorns","styleId":70,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-02-22 18:00:57","updateDate":"2012-03-22 13:05:50","style":{"id":70,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Other Belgian-Style Ales","shortName":"Belgian Ale","description":"Recognizing the uniqueness and traditions of several other styles of Belgian Ales, the beers entered in this category will be assessed on the merits that they do not fit existing style guidelines and information that the brewer provides explaining the history and tradition of the style.

We've worked hard and are incredibly proud of the many successes we've enjoyed over the years. The Boston Beer Company has been cited as one of the best companies to work for by Boston Magazine, one of the Best Entry-Level Jobs by The Princeton Review, and our beers have won more awards than any other in history. Jim has been named an \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" by Inc. Magazine. Our brewers keep amazing us with innovative new brews, including Samuel Adams Utopias and our Samuel Adams Barrel Room Collection.\r\n\r\nJim has believed from the beginning that the more you know and understand about beer, the more you'll appreciate a beer like Samuel Adams Boston Lager. To begin that mission, all new employees go through intensive training on everything from ingredients, brewing, and beer styles, to taking care of the beer once it leaves the brewery. We're all beer lovers and protectors of the beer so we're trained how to identify off flavors and how to troubleshoot the causes. The passion for beer continues with an annual homebrew competition that we all take part in.\r\n\r\nOne of our wholesalers once asked Jim why he invested so much in training his people, when ultimately they might leave. Jim smiled and replied without hesitation: \"What if I didn't train them, and they stayed?\"\r\n\r\nEach year, usually in January, everyone gathers together. One of the highlights of the meeting is the beer trivia contest. With a culture so steeped in beer education and knowledge, winning is a pretty big deal.

A labor of love in which long brew days in the garage, bad equipment, curious dogs (we still blame them for a bad batch or two) and hanging out with friends became commonplace. Once it took root, this hobby turned into a passion (along with some really solid beers).\r\n\r\nWe took our wares to football games, parties, and cookouts. Before too long, folks began requesting our beer. It\u2019s pretty fun to have someone you don\u2019t even know walk right smack dab up to you and tell you how much they like your beer. We didn\u2019t set out to start a business, the business just found us. \r\n\r\n\u201cOnce in a while you get shown the light in the strangest of places if you look at it right\u201d Robert Hunter\r\n\r\nWe wanted to brew our beer and create something that would make our families, friends, community, and ourselves proud in what we were doing. We wanted to give back and help support those that helped support us.  We wanted to represent the unique qualities of the South that make us proud to be southerners. \r\n\r\nGood People Brewing Company seemed like the perfect fit.  Good People describes the kind, humble, concerned, and respected folks all throughout the South, no matter if your speaking singularly or plurally. That is what we strive for here at Good People Brewing Company\u2026.to be good people. \r\n\r\nIn September of 2007, we acquired our equipment and started getting our brewery put together.

We just gained a new brewery here in Brooklyn. A few months ago, we busted through the brewhouse wall into another building and expanded our fermentation cellars.Now we\u2019ve just finished installing a big shiny new set of German brewhouse equipment. Over the coming years, we\u2019re going to brew you a lot of fun new beers on this baby.\r\nFirst, though, it\u2019s time to rev this whole thing up and get it humming. The first beer out of our new brewhouse is Brooklyn Main Engine Start, a burnishedgold ale in the rare \u201cAbbey Singel\u201d style, reminiscent of the un-filtered beers that Trappist monks make for themselves. It\u2019s dry and biscuity on the palate, with a lilt of spicy Belgian yeast character and a snappy hop bite. Judicious dry hopping with Slovenian Aurora hops lends an appetizing herbal note. It\u2019s tasty enough to stick with for the whole evening, and at about 6% ABV, it won\u2019t have you tripping over snow banks after just one.\r\nWe know it\u2019s winter and you might have been expecting something heavy and dark, but right now we\u2019re just not in a heavy and dark mood. In fact, we\u2019re feeling pretty cheerful, and we want to celebrate with a bunch of our friends and a few pints of beer. If you\u2019re in the neighborhood, stop by during our tour hours and see the new brewery. If you\u2019ve seen the brewery before, you\u2019ll be amazed what we\u2019ve done with the place.
