By 1994, we outgrew the original site (now our 100-seat brew pub) and moved up the road to a larger facility to keep up with demand.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe brew over 160,000 barrels of beer and 10,000 barrels of root beer in our state-of-the-art brewing facility. Our lagers and ales are brewed in small batches, hand-crafted by a team of dedicated workers with only the highest ideals of quality. This pride, along with our brewing process, is what creates our great brews.\r\n\r\nWe are privately owned and operated by local shareholders, many who have been with us since day one.\r\n\r\nAbita uses only the finest ingredients \u2013 British and North American malted barley, German and American yeast strains, Pacific Northwest hops and the pure artesian water of Abita Springs.\r\n\r\nIn Abita Springs, we are blessed with the purest of water. Drawn from our deep wells, our pristine water is not altered in any way.\r\n\r\nAbita Beer has no preservatives, additives or stabilizers and is cold filtered.

Society thinks it's going right by you, that it's left you all together.

In 2008, they opened a production brewery about 1 mile from their brewpub allowing them to triple production, take on more accounts locally, and distribute some beer in 4 more states.","website":"http:\/\/www.russianriverbrewing.com\/","established":"1997","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BSsTGw\/upload_ozwafH-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BSsTGw\/upload_ozwafH-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BSsTGw\/upload_ozwafH-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BSsTGw\/upload_ozwafH-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BSsTGw\/upload_ozwafH-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:56:33","locations":[{"id":"vuehNG","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"724 4th Street","locality":"Santa Rosa","region":"California","postalCode":"95404","phone":"707-545-2337","website":"http:\/\/www.russianriverbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Thu:\t11:00 am - 12:00 am\r\nFri - Sat:\t11:00 am - 1:00 am\r\nSun:\t11:00 am - 12:00 am","latitude":38.441415,"longitude":-122.711872,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1997","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"Pxy2bv","name":"Production Facility","streetAddress":"1812 Ferdinand Ct","locality":"Santa Rosa","region":"California","postalCode":"95404","website":"http:\/\/www.russianriverbrewing.com\/","latitude":38.421129,"longitude":-122.709695,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-07-13 11:55:28","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"zavr6L","name":"Rig Pig Pale Ale","nameDisplay":"Rig Pig Pale Ale","description":"A hop lovers delight.

Art co-founded one of the state's first microbreweries, Portland Brewing, as well as the Oregon Brewers Festival, which today is one of the world's preeminent craft beer festivals. \r\n\r\nCascade Brewmaster Ron Gansberg got his start in the Northwest wine industry. He crossed over in 1986 and began an eight-year career at BridgePort Brewing Co., where he honed his brewing skills, then moved on to the equipment and engineering side of the industry. As Engineering Manager at BridgePort, Ron directed the design and installation of the 80 bbl brewhouse that is still in operation. \r\n\r\nTogether, Art and Ron put their 40 years of beer experience to work, designing and installing Cascade's state-of-the-art 10 bbl brewing system in SW Portland, then creating and distributing well-balanced market-priced ales ranging from Pale Ale to Copper to Blond Bock. As the quality of the beer improved, they began to sell through distributors, increasing production to satisfy the wholesale market. \r\n\r\nCascade Brewery is situated in the Pacific Northwest, a region renowned for its craft beers - the Portland metropolitan area has 42 breweries, more than any other metro area in the US, and is the nation's largest craft brewing market. Even though there are an abundance of breweries in this area, it's highly competitive. To stand out amongst this group, you need to push the envelope and be out there to get to your niche and magic elixir.","website":"http:\/\/www.cascadebrewing.com\/","established":"1998","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/fF1DVj\/upload_S326LL-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/fF1DVj\/upload_S326LL-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/fF1DVj\/upload_S326LL-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/fF1DVj\/upload_S326LL-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/fF1DVj\/upload_S326LL-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:50","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:55:31","locations":[{"id":"lijo4X","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"7424 SW Beaverton Hillsdale Hwy.","locality":"Portland","region":"Oregon","postalCode":"97225","phone":"503-296-0110","website":"http:\/\/www.cascadebrewing.com\/","latitude":45.485627,"longitude":-122.753996,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1998","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:50","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"DnQkrw","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"939 SE Belmont","locality":"Portland","region":"Oregon","postalCode":"97214","latitude":45.5166668,"longitude":-122.6560412,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"restaurant","locationTypeDisplay":"Restaurant\/Ale House","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-07-04 05:03:47","updateDate":"2015-07-07 13:30:30","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"BM8B2O","name":"Ringmaster","nameDisplay":"Ringmaster","abv":"3.9","styleId":25,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-09-01 15:31:07","updateDate":"2015-09-01 15:31:07","style":{"id":25,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"American Pale","description":"American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.

This, to us, means the comprehensive enjoyment of beer in a way that enhances the overall experience of life.\r\n\r\nThe basic formula for our entire lineup of hand-crafted Baird Beer is the same: Balance + Complexity = Character. We are dedicated to the crafting of beer that bursts with flavor and character. We will not brew vapid beer and we are not afraid of not appealing to everyone. We brew to our own exacting standards and it is our daily mission to not disappoint ourselves.\r\n\r\nIn addition to crafting Baird Beer, we also own and directly operate a growing stable of beer pubs which we call our Taprooms (Numazu Fishmarket Taproom, Nakameguro Taproom, etc.). Baird Beer also is sold through a steadily expanding family of outside pubs, restaurants and liquor stores in Japan as well as being exported to select international markets. Consumer purchases of Baird Beer direct from the brewery are possible through our online estore (delivery only within Japan).","website":"http:\/\/bairdbeer.com\/","established":"2000","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/NDPKIS\/upload_IN2zqq-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/NDPKIS\/upload_IN2zqq-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/NDPKIS\/upload_IN2zqq-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/NDPKIS\/upload_IN2zqq-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/NDPKIS\/upload_IN2zqq-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:45","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:27:37","locations":[{"id":"AzIZR4","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"9-3, Tadehara-cho","locality":"Numazu","region":"Shizuoka","postalCode":"410-0843","phone":"055-952-6673","website":"http:\/\/bairdbeer.com\/","latitude":35.082445,"longitude":138.861084,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"JP","yearOpened":"2000","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:45","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"JP","name":"JAPAN","displayName":"Japan","isoThree":"JPN","numberCode":392,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"FfLQRs","name":"River Bend Pale Ale","nameDisplay":"River Bend Pale Ale","description":"Hybrid American and English pale ale, dry hopped with Falconers Flight and utilizing American and English grains and hops, balanced and a straight forward moderate pale ale.
