John Matthias Falliers founded Frankenmuth\u2019s first brewery in 1857. Cousins William Knaust and Martin Heubisch opened the Cass River Brewery just north of the Fallier property in 1862, where the Frankenmuth Brewery continues to stand today.\r\n\r\nThe Cass River Brewery was purchased by Johann Geyer in 1874, and renamed Geyer\u2019s Brothers Brewing Co. For the next 112 years, the facility operated under many names including the Frankenmuth Brewing Co. Ferdinand \u201cFred\u201d Schumacher from Duseldorf, Germany, purchased the brewery one year before a fire destroyed most of the structure in 1987.\r\n\r\nThe microbrewery continued operation following ownership acquisition by Randall E. Heine in 1990. The nation\u2019s second oldest microbrewery was at peak production in 1996, distributing more than 30,000 barrels of locally produced microbrews across 25 states, when a F3 tornado struck our facility, causing several million dollars of damage. A brew pub was opened in 2003 and closed three years later.\r\n\r\nOur Frankenmuth Brewing Company, housed in the historic four story, 28,000 square foot building is an exciting destination for food lovers and beer aficionados alike.","website":"http:\/\/frankenmuthbrewery.com\/","established":"1862","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/xUwGtE\/upload_1DNBW7-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/xUwGtE\/upload_1DNBW7-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/xUwGtE\/upload_1DNBW7-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/xUwGtE\/upload_1DNBW7-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/xUwGtE\/upload_1DNBW7-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:11:49","locations":[{"id":"IgdWNj","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"425 S Main Street","locality":"Frankenmuth","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"48734","phone":"989-262-8300","website":"http:\/\/frankenmuthbrewery.com\/","latitude":43.330981,"longitude":-83.737896,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1862","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"LdM0JX","name":"Chucks Pumpkin Ale","nameDisplay":"Chucks Pumpkin Ale","abv":"6","glasswareId":5,"availableId":4,"styleId":124,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:59","updateDate":"2014-10-13 18:29:26","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":124,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Herb and Spice Beer","shortName":"Spice Beer","description":"Herb beers use herbs or spices (derived from roots, seeds, fruits, vegetable, flowers, etc.) other than or in addition to hops to create a distinct (ranging from subtle to intense) character, though individual characters of herbs and\/or spices used may not always be identifiable.

Those of you who saw the old brewery may remember the retrofitted dairy equipment we used. We held on to two of those tanks in our move to the East Asheville location. Alongside them, we have new fermentation and brite beer tanks to go with our 50-barrel brew house.

For many, the brewery was a thing shrouded in mystery... college students-which comprise a fair percentage of Ellensburg's population for most of the year-would occasionally see a bottle on a store shelf and ask where it came from. The likely response:\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, I think some dude makes that in his basement or something...\"\r\n\r\nThe word just wasn't getting out, and things didn't look good for the tiny brewery that made exceptionally tasty ales. \r\nWell, a couple of hoodlums in their late-twenties jumped on the opportunity to own and operate their own brewery, and what resulted is the Iron Horse Brewery you know and love today. They tweaked some recipes, changed some names, threw some ridiculous theme parties to encourage locals to actually see the brewery with their own eyes, and good things started to happen. Locals started to dig what the guys were doing. A few bars took a chance and put Iron Horse back on tap, and the beer started flowing. \r\n\r\nThe word started getting out.","website":"http:\/\/www.ironhorsebrewery.com\/","established":"2004","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ni4EnY\/upload_V7RJjR-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ni4EnY\/upload_V7RJjR-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ni4EnY\/upload_V7RJjR-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ni4EnY\/upload_V7RJjR-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ni4EnY\/upload_V7RJjR-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:04:41","locations":[{"id":"xZTJW3","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1000 Prospect Street","extendedAddress":"Suite 4","locality":"Ellensburg","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98926","phone":"509-933-3134","website":"http:\/\/www.ironhorsebrewery.com\/","latitude":46.9994703,"longitude":-120.5648701,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2004","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"ub3w6S","name":"Critz's Pumpkin Ale","nameDisplay":"Critz's Pumpkin Ale","description":"200 pounds of fresh hand-picked pumpkins from Critz Farm in Cazenovia are added to the mash of this beer.

As Graduation grew near and the cold reality of post-collegiate life set in Luke and Ryan knew that they could turn their affinity for beer and their new found ability to make it into a viable alternative to unemployment or sitting at a desk answering to \"The Man\". Of course, they couldn't do it by themselves, so after very little convincing, they got roommate and friends, Mark Sinclair and Will Rafferty to join them.\r\n\r\nOn Father's Day in 1999, after almost two years of planning and preperation, the first batch of Hurricane Amber Ale was brewed. By July 2nd the first kegs had been shipped to three Newport Restaurants and were quickly tapped and emptied. A little over a month after the release of the first kegs, 6-packs of Hurricane Amber Ale began to hit the shelves.

We've worked hard and are incredibly proud of the many successes we've enjoyed over the years. The Boston Beer Company has been cited as one of the best companies to work for by Boston Magazine, one of the Best Entry-Level Jobs by The Princeton Review, and our beers have won more awards than any other in history. Jim has been named an \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" by Inc. Magazine. Our brewers keep amazing us with innovative new brews, including Samuel Adams Utopias and our Samuel Adams Barrel Room Collection.\r\n\r\nJim has believed from the beginning that the more you know and understand about beer, the more you'll appreciate a beer like Samuel Adams Boston Lager. To begin that mission, all new employees go through intensive training on everything from ingredients, brewing, and beer styles, to taking care of the beer once it leaves the brewery. We're all beer lovers and protectors of the beer so we're trained how to identify off flavors and how to troubleshoot the causes. The passion for beer continues with an annual homebrew competition that we all take part in.\r\n\r\nOne of our wholesalers once asked Jim why he invested so much in training his people, when ultimately they might leave. Jim smiled and replied without hesitation: \"What if I didn't train them, and they stayed?\"\r\n\r\nEach year, usually in January, everyone gathers together. One of the highlights of the meeting is the beer trivia contest. With a culture so steeped in beer education and knowledge, winning is a pretty big deal. Recently, one of the hotel bartenders who was watching as the various teams arrived in costume with music and much enthusiasm and fanfare, said, \"I've always known Samuel Adams made the best beer in America, but now I see this is the greatest company in America.\" When you look around you see that The Boston Beer Company is a team of enthusiastic people who are passionate about beer and who really love coming to work every day to provide American drinkers with the best beer possible.\r\n\r\nThe Boston Beer Company, Inc. is a publicly-traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol, SAM.","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","established":"1984","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:24:45","locations":[{"id":"DF5YsC","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"30 Germania Street","locality":"Boston","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"02130","phone":"1-800-372-1131","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","latitude":42.314449,"longitude":-71.103365,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1984","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2015-12-02 19:22:03","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"MLUbXI","name":"Cincinnati","streetAddress":"1625 Central Parkway","locality":"Cincinnati","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45214","phone":"513-412-3200","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","latitude":39.1144986,"longitude":-84.5222061,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-12 13:10:57","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"XZ6L8a","name":"Production Brewery","streetAddress":"7880 Penn Drive","locality":"Breinigsville","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"18031","latitude":40.5759622,"longitude":-75.6290377,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2007","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-11-30 20:24:56","updateDate":"2015-12-02 19:22:03","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"x20YHH","name":"Down East Harvest Ale \u2013 SEASONAL","nameDisplay":"Down East Harvest Ale \u2013 SEASONAL","description":"Shine on Harvest Moon!
