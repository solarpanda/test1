We source organic apples from across Washington state and grow our own organic orchard of over 3000 trees, with 20 varieties of heirloom and traditional cider apple varieties.  We aspire to serve the land with cider,  by caring for our soils, watershed and community while crafting award-winning premium ciders. Our ciders are a tribute to old hard cider traditions but also offer an approachable, fresh perspective on the possibilities of the fermented apple.","website":"http:\/\/www.finnriver.com\/","established":"2003","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/OjrtTM\/upload_Yr2UV1-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/OjrtTM\/upload_Yr2UV1-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/OjrtTM\/upload_Yr2UV1-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/OjrtTM\/upload_Yr2UV1-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/OjrtTM\/upload_Yr2UV1-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-04-25 18:37:21","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:08:02","locations":[{"id":"spKdFu","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"142 Barn Swallow Road","locality":"Chimacum","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98325","latitude":47.9762401,"longitude":-122.7791261,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"cidery","locationTypeDisplay":"Cidery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-04-27 13:54:30","updateDate":"2015-04-27 13:54:30","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"YjnPcx","name":"Crandaddy's Got Wood","nameDisplay":"Crandaddy's Got Wood","abv":"6.9","styleId":157,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-01-20 15:48:26","updateDate":"2016-01-20 15:48:26","style":{"id":157,"categoryId":12,"category":{"id":12,"name":"Mead, Cider, & Perry","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Other Specialty Cider or Perry","shortName":"Specialty Cider","abvMin":"5","abvMax":"12","ogMin":"1.045","ogMax":"1.1","fgMin":"0.995","fgMax":"1.02","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:49:22"},"breweries":[{"id":"mAAJMW","name":"Vander Mill Winery, Cider Mill & Microbrewery","nameShortDisplay":"Vander Mill Winery, Cider Mill & Microbrewery","description":"With humble beginnings as a cider mill in 2006 with a 5,000-square-foot building, Vander Mill began distributing their cider products in 750 ml. glass bottles in 2008 and in draft kegs.\r\n\r\nVander Mill is now distributing their hard cider varieties in convenience and grocery stores, bars, and restaurants throughout Michigan, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are going to continue our focus on innovation and creativity with our ciders,\u201d Paul Vander Heide, Owner, said. \u201cBut we wanted to take a few of our core products and make them more accessible to customers.\u201d","website":"http:\/\/www.vandermill.com\/","established":"2006","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/mAAJMW\/upload_qwgr0B-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/mAAJMW\/upload_qwgr0B-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/mAAJMW\/upload_qwgr0B-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/mAAJMW\/upload_qwgr0B-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/mAAJMW\/upload_qwgr0B-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-10-29 15:40:37","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:48:02","locations":[{"id":"hCCFgr","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"14921 Cleveland Street","locality":"Spring Lake","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49456","phone":"616 842 4337","website":"http:\/\/www.vandermill.com\/","latitude":43.074784,"longitude":-86.1585,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"cidery","locationTypeDisplay":"Cidery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-11-13 18:03:31","updateDate":"2014-11-03 19:23:46","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"sV0UpV","name":"Crimson Dew","nameDisplay":"Crimson Dew","description":"Our cherry apple hard cider.
