Apparently hats tasted, because it soon emerged that there should be more than just a hobby. Toms brother Michael came into the game and the initial thinking to open a microbrewery were the end of 2007 in the room. The onetime still very amateurish plans were (from the current perspective thankfully) not implemented. The idea persisted, however. And so Tom and John went once to Weihenstephan to study at TUM brewing and beverage technology. In early 2012, the plans were revived and Raphael came on board.\r\n\r\nWe played different scenarios: Own Brewery vs. Gypsy Brewing, building the brand, and most importantly the recipe development. It quickly became apparent that the construction of their own brewing equipment from the beginning is difficult to achieve and for us the concept as Gypsy Brewer is the path to the goal. After an intensive search for a partner brewery we could start our cooperation with Reinhold Barta Brauhaus cast. Even today, we brew our beers in the casting, and so you could call us sedentary migrant Brauer, because unlike classic Gypsy brewers that produce many breweries (blank), we brew our beers to our ideas almost exclusively in the casting.\r\n\r\nLooking ahead, we are aiming for the establishment of our own brewery in Vienna.","website":"http:\/\/www.brewage.at","established":"2007","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Y2gEyS\/upload_2iJD2s-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Y2gEyS\/upload_2iJD2s-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Y2gEyS\/upload_2iJD2s-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Y2gEyS\/upload_2iJD2s-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Y2gEyS\/upload_2iJD2s-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-05-07 17:45:28","updateDate":"2016-05-07 18:30:52","locations":[{"id":"mMnrjZ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Mittelgasse 4","locality":"1060 Wien","phone":"+43 1 9550935","website":"http:\/\/brewage.at\/","hoursOfOperation":"Tue:  2:00pm - 7:00pm\nWed:  2:00pm - 7:00pm\nThu:  2:00pm - 7:00pm\nFri:  12:00pm - 5:00pm\n\n","latitude":48.1939642,"longitude":16.3434939,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"AT","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-05-07 17:50:12","updateDate":"2016-05-07 17:50:12","country":{"isoCode":"AT","name":"AUSTRIA","displayName":"Austria","isoThree":"AUT","numberCode":40,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"2CCEd7","name":"Irish Walker","nameDisplay":"Irish Walker","description":"Irish Walker is an English-Style Barley Wine.

So, for example, if we say a beer will taste like peanut butter and jelly, you can be sure you\u2019ll smell and taste the fresh roasted peanuts and fruity berry jam. Our flagship beers such as Hop Gun IPA and Floridian Hefeweizen, also strive towards big, bold flavor. It\u2019s who we are.\r\n\r\nOur Brewery is located in the heart of Oakland Park\u2019s new Culinary Arts District. The 20,000 sq-ft facility is powered by a 30-barrel, three-piece brewhouse, which feeds nearly 1000 gallons of beer per batch into our four 60-barrel fermenters - a capacity that makes us South Florida\u2019s largest craft microbrewery. Each of our distinctive beers is brewed using the finest, all-natural ingredients, then served up unpasteurized, unfiltered, and unfussed with. We offer tours of our 20,000 sq-ft facility, rotating food trucks nightly, and growlers of our brewery fresh beer to-go.\r\n\r\nYou can sample our creations in our spacious tap room - open 7 days a week, noon to midnight - as well as in bars and restaurants all across South Florida. And of course, we still brew at our original location in Boca Raton, the Funky Buddha Brewery & Lounge, which has become a test kitchen for our more experimental brews.\r\n\r\nSee you soon for a pint!

We knew what we wanted to drink, but we needed some help actually brewing it. So we enlisted our first brewer, took over some warehouse space on the Boston waterfront, and began introducing fresh, local craft beer to Boston drinkers. We tried to do it in a way that captured the spirit of fun that had brought us to beer in the first place. From that warehouse, surrounded by fish companies on the docks of South Boston (neighboring what is now the Seaport District), we couldn\u2019t imagine that craft brewing would become what it has today.  \r\n\r\nWe still remember our days on the other side of the bar, and have spent as much time spreading the joy of beer drinking as we have focusing on recipes, ingredients, and brewing equipment. Hopefully our sense of gratitude is reflected in both the quality of the beer and the spirit of fun and enjoyment surrounding our beer and breweries.

Did you know that in ancient times beer was the safest way to drink water? This is because beers have a long duration without spoiling due to microorganisms responsible for fermentation yeasts. These can overlap with agents that invade their surroundings, beer, killing them. Due to the lower alcohol content does not lead to dehydration as much as other alcoholic beverages. Thus one Brew is valid for drinking from about 1 year. The most interesting is that adequately conditioned beers, depending on the style, last up to five or even more years in the most extreme cases. Our all beers last more than 1 year but because the properties change with time, to better almost always guarantee only that period to enjoy what described on the label.\r\n\r\nHow do fermentation in the bottle always guarantee that the beer will live yeast to the consumer, which on the one hand clears the beer and the other creates gas in it.

Krook's Mill, now the Manayunk Brewery and Restaurant, was one of the linchpins of the then booming industry. Anne Dawson opened the mill in 1822 at the mouth of the Manayunk Canal and the Krook family followed with the existing building just short of 100 years later in 1912. A cornerstone from the original mill was placed in the new building. Krook's Mill eventually closed its doors in 1992.\r\n\r\nFour years later, Harry Renner IV brought the facility back to life as a space for retail business, a fine eatery, a brewery and as an entertainment complex for both neighbors and visitors alike to enjoy. Our first batch of fresh-brewed beer was tapped on October 17, 1996. In 2000, we expanded our outdoor seating with a deck overlooking the Schuylkill River. In 2003, we added a Stone Pizza Oven and a Sushi Bar to expand our menu selection.
