Our brew master is the \u201cBig German\u201d Uwe Boer that we all know and love. He works magic in his craft and the passion that he shows for brewing fills the glasses as his award winning beer dispenses from our taps. We now boast our own regular taps but his innovation in our seasonal ales and distinct brewing style is what keeps our bar stools full and the place hopping. We can hardly keep his cask conditioned ale on tap as our customers are known to consume the kegs in record time.\r\n\r\n\u201cGreat Beer, Great Food and Great Service\u201d became our motto as we plugged through the first few years and now the slogan is what we live by. Our fantastic customers and great staff are what makes us who we are and how we stand out in the sea of new restaurants that pop up daily. It is our great customers that made it so easy to push forward into brewing and our loyal staff that helped to smooth over the transition. We continue to grow and change over time just as any business wants to do but it is remembering the little things that have gotten us to where we are today. After all in today\u2019s crazy hectic world it is the little things in life that make it all worth it.","website":"http:\/\/sunup.beer\/","established":"2001","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/F3gIYO\/upload_qemRGp-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/F3gIYO\/upload_qemRGp-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/F3gIYO\/upload_qemRGp-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/F3gIYO\/upload_qemRGp-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/F3gIYO\/upload_qemRGp-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2016-06-27 18:25:37","locations":[{"id":"nnn6Sq","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"322 East Camelback Road","locality":"Phoenix","region":"Arizona","postalCode":"85012","phone":"(602) 279-8909","website":"http:\/\/www.sunupbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Sunday - Thursday 11:00am - 11:00pm\r\nFriday and Saturday to Midnight\r\nHappy Hour: 3:00 - 6:00 PM Daily","latitude":33.509286,"longitude":-112.068897,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"NNOPgI","name":"Hornets Nest","nameDisplay":"Hornets Nest","abv":"5.2","glasswareId":5,"availableId":4,"styleId":48,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/NNOPgI\/upload_50QjJZ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/NNOPgI\/upload_50QjJZ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/NNOPgI\/upload_50QjJZ-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-06-11 20:16:15","updateDate":"2016-05-27 20:29:50","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":48,"categoryId":4,"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"South German-Style Hefeweizen \/ Hefeweissbier","shortName":"Hefeweizen","description":"The aroma and flavor of a Weissbier with yeast is decidedly fruity and phenolic.

We\u2019re a small team with big dreams and tend to smile while we sweat. We brew those styles which are most compelling to our thirst and we certainly hope you enjoy our brews as much as we do.\r\n\r\nRhinegeist means \u201cghost of the Rhine\u201d, and refers to our place here in the historic Brewery District in the Over the Rhine neighborhood of Cincinnati. At the turn of the century, this neighborhood was home to nearly 45,o00 inhabitants, most of them of German descent and 38 breweries. We hope to engender the spirit of camaraderie and hard work that we imagine those living and brewing in this neighborhood at that time embodied.\r\n\r\nWe self distribute our beer, which means each beer that you drink in a bar or restaurant is poured from a keg that we delivered cold in our refrigerated van (keep your eyes peeled for it around town). We like to keep beer as fresh as possible, which means that every keg we fill is immediately moved into cold storage where it sits until we load it onto our refrigerated van for delivery to the coldbox of each local account.

Our goal is to brew world class beers and deliver them to our customers as fresh as possible making them the best beers in Texas and Louisiana. Our customers are beer lovers - people that appreciate great, full-flavored beers.\r\n\r\nOur small crew does everything at the brewery: brew the beer, filter the beer, keg the beer, bottle the beer, sell the beer and drink the beer. For us, this is a passion, not a job. We believe that this comes through in the beers we make. Our beers have soul.\r\n\r\nWe brew several different beers; some are year round, some are seasonal and a few are single batch brews. They are available in bars, restaurants, grocery stores, liquor stores and warehouse stores throughout Texas and Louisiana.\r\n\r\nOur first keg of beer was shipped on June 9, 1994. Founded by Brock Wagner and Kevin Bartol, we chose Houston because, other than living here, this was the largest city in the country that did not have a microbrewery. Brock was a longtime homebrewer and had considered opening a brewery as far back as college, although that was quickly dismissed as a silly idea. Seven years after graduating, Brock revisited the idea, enlisted Kevin's help and the brewery was off and running. Kevin has since left the business after a bitter battle. (Just kidding - but don't you wish people wrote that when it was the truth?).\r\n\r\nPlease visit us if you are in Houston. We have a public open house every weekday at 3:00 PM and every Saturday starting at 11:00 AM.\r\n\r\nCheers!","website":"http:\/\/www.saintarnold.com\/","established":"1994","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/visitor.constantcontact.com\/manage\/optin?v=001uBxRG66eq3ajbdfZ6GjL91di7O20EmmX","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/H3UW27\/upload_rnr6XH-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/H3UW27\/upload_rnr6XH-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/H3UW27\/upload_rnr6XH-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/H3UW27\/upload_rnr6XH-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/H3UW27\/upload_rnr6XH-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:56:40","locations":[{"id":"jPbb33","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2000 Lyons Avenue","locality":"Houston","region":"Texas","postalCode":"77020","phone":"713-686-9494","website":"http:\/\/www.saintarnold.com\/","latitude":29.7715192,"longitude":-95.3484972,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1994","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"TdUag1","name":"Immortal Beloved","nameDisplay":"Immortal Beloved","abv":"5.5","styleId":48,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/TdUag1\/upload_wpRKBf-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/TdUag1\/upload_wpRKBf-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/TdUag1\/upload_wpRKBf-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-05-05 02:39:47","updateDate":"2015-12-18 01:39:05","style":{"id":48,"categoryId":4,"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"South German-Style Hefeweizen \/ Hefeweissbier","shortName":"Hefeweizen","description":"The aroma and flavor of a Weissbier with yeast is decidedly fruity and phenolic.

We went after taste.\r\n\r\nNow, after 100 years of waiting, Cheboygan Brewing Company is back!","website":"http:\/\/www.cheboyganbrewing.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jk7PdH\/upload_YOsfzI-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jk7PdH\/upload_YOsfzI-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jk7PdH\/upload_YOsfzI-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jk7PdH\/upload_YOsfzI-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jk7PdH\/upload_YOsfzI-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-11 19:38:29","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:36:33","locations":[{"id":"ZxFNXb","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"101 N.

Under-qualified and unprepared, they started their journey with a Sherpa, a donkey, and a suitcase full of contraband. Naturally, half way through the trip the contraband was gone and the Sherpa and donkey had run off, leaving George and his group to fend for themselves. Luckily, everyone managed to make it off the mountain alive, and with a new outlook on life.\r\n\r\nHorn Dog Denver Colorado BeerLike any good beer drinker would at the end of an experience like that, George and his group found a local Pakistani hotel bar to have a drink in.

George gladly signed away and got down to some serious drinking. That\u2019s about the time he noticed a painting in the Flashman Hotel of a Flying Dog hanging on the wall that had been drawn by a local artist. Now, we all know dogs don\u2019t fly, but nobody told this particular dog it couldn\u2019t fly, just like no one had told George and his friends they couldn\u2019t make this extraordinary journey. The Flying Dog became a symbol that George and his group used to describe what had happened to them with the mantra, \u201cit is amazing what you can achieve if nobody tells you that you can't.","website":"http:\/\/www.flyingdogbrewery.com\/","established":"1990","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jmGoBA\/upload_H9xzdZ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jmGoBA\/upload_H9xzdZ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jmGoBA\/upload_H9xzdZ-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jmGoBA\/upload_H9xzdZ-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/jmGoBA\/upload_H9xzdZ-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:46:05","locations":[{"id":"EPqUQP","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"4607 Wedgewood Blvd","locality":"Frederick","region":"Maryland","postalCode":"21703","phone":"301-694-7899","website":"http:\/\/www.flyingdogales.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Tours are offered every Thursday and Friday from 4 to 6 pm, along with two sessions on Saturday (12 to 2 pm and 2:30 - 4:30 pm).","latitude":39.361926,"longitude":-77.424677,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1983","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"g9z3GM","name":"India Pale Weizen","nameDisplay":"India Pale Weizen","description":"Collaboration with Weihenstephan","abv":"6.2","availableId":1,"styleId":48,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/g9z3GM\/upload_nWNWax-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/g9z3GM\/upload_nWNWax-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/g9z3GM\/upload_nWNWax-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-01-23 20:33:15","updateDate":"2015-12-17 21:40:07","available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":48,"categoryId":4,"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"South German-Style Hefeweizen \/ Hefeweissbier","shortName":"Hefeweizen","description":"The aroma and flavor of a Weissbier with yeast is decidedly fruity and phenolic.

Soon he found himself president and heading up the Marin County State Fair competitions, and after burning out all the burners on the stove, he was banished to brewing outdoors. A certified beer judge, he worked at Marin Brewing Company before starting off on his own, moving south to Carpinteria. Now a family run brewery, Island Brewing Company has won awards on both the state and national level. We serve local bars, restaurants, and retail outlets and have five and fifteen-gallon kegs and 22-ounce bottles available for weddings, caterers, as well as for thirsty individuals that happen to come our way.
