We've worked hard and are incredibly proud of the many successes we've enjoyed over the years. The Boston Beer Company has been cited as one of the best companies to work for by Boston Magazine, one of the Best Entry-Level Jobs by The Princeton Review, and our beers have won more awards than any other in history. Jim has been named an \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" by Inc. Magazine. Our brewers keep amazing us with innovative new brews, including Samuel Adams Utopias and our Samuel Adams Barrel Room Collection.\r\n\r\nJim has believed from the beginning that the more you know and understand about beer, the more you'll appreciate a beer like Samuel Adams Boston Lager. To begin that mission, all new employees go through intensive training on everything from ingredients, brewing, and beer styles, to taking care of the beer once it leaves the brewery. We're all beer lovers and protectors of the beer so we're trained how to identify off flavors and how to troubleshoot the causes. The passion for beer continues with an annual homebrew competition that we all take part in.\r\n\r\nOne of our wholesalers once asked Jim why he invested so much in training his people, when ultimately they might leave. Jim smiled and replied without hesitation: \"What if I didn't train them, and they stayed?\"\r\n\r\nEach year, usually in January, everyone gathers together. One of the highlights of the meeting is the beer trivia contest. With a culture so steeped in beer education and knowledge, winning is a pretty big deal. Recently, one of the hotel bartenders who was watching as the various teams arrived in costume with music and much enthusiasm and fanfare, said, \"I've always known Samuel Adams made the best beer in America, but now I see this is the greatest company in America.\" When you look around you see that The Boston Beer Company is a team of enthusiastic people who are passionate about beer and who really love coming to work every day to provide American drinkers with the best beer possible.\r\n\r\nThe Boston Beer Company, Inc. is a publicly-traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol, SAM.","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","established":"1984","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:24:45","locations":[{"id":"DF5YsC","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"30 Germania Street","locality":"Boston","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"02130","phone":"1-800-372-1131","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","latitude":42.314449,"longitude":-71.103365,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1984","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2015-12-02 19:22:03","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"MLUbXI","name":"Cincinnati","streetAddress":"1625 Central Parkway","locality":"Cincinnati","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45214","phone":"513-412-3200","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","latitude":39.1144986,"longitude":-84.5222061,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-12 13:10:57","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"XZ6L8a","name":"Production Brewery","streetAddress":"7880 Penn Drive","locality":"Breinigsville","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"18031","latitude":40.5759622,"longitude":-75.6290377,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2007","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-11-30 20:24:56","updateDate":"2015-12-02 19:22:03","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"EYPVEj","name":"Bacon Porter","nameDisplay":"Bacon Porter","styleId":18,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-10-21 20:34:07","updateDate":"2015-04-24 20:10:48","style":{"id":18,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Brown Porter","shortName":"Brown Porter","description":"Brown porters are mid to dark brown (may have red tint) in color.

After homebrewing on the family farm for years, homebrewer Cory Schroeder teamed up with Jim Wiesender to found the brewery in 1999.\r\n\r\nUsing equipment scrounged from various industries, such as a converted pudding tank for the brew kettle, the pair launched a successful business, brewing the beer just steps away from the chicken coop and a busy dairy farm.\r\n\r\nTheir Sand Creek Golden Ale and English Style Special Ale, available only on draft and in half-gallon growlers, soon developed a reputation throughout Wisconsin's many brew fests. With a capacity of only about 150 barrels per year, the brewery, now with a third owner on board, quickly outgrew the little farm shed converted into a brewhouse.\r\n\r\nHoping to remain in the Dunn\/St. Croix counties area, the company looked for a suitable place to relocate, but came up empty handed. Then opportunity knocked in the form of a phone call one evening from their friend in Black River Falls, Pioneer brewing's brewmaster Todd Krueger. The brewery was for sale.\r\n\r\nIn March of 2004 the combined forces of the two breweries officially formed the new Sand Creek Brewing Co. of Black River Falls, Wisconsin.","website":"http:\/\/www.sandcreekbrewing.com\/","established":"1999","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gsADrL\/upload_RPFu23-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gsADrL\/upload_RPFu23-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gsADrL\/upload_RPFu23-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gsADrL\/upload_RPFu23-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gsADrL\/upload_RPFu23-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:56:58","locations":[{"id":"TSKxwK","name":"Sand Creek Brewing Co","streetAddress":"320 Pierce St","extendedAddress":"Box 187","locality":"Black River Falls","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"54615","phone":"(715) 284-7553","website":"http:\/\/www.sandcreekbrewing.com\/","latitude":44.2830622,"longitude":-90.7913227,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1998","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2015-12-04 17:57:24","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"R9cgbi","name":"Bald Cypress Porter","nameDisplay":"Bald Cypress Porter","abv":"5","styleId":18,"isOrganic":"Y","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-07-09 00:25:06","updateDate":"2015-07-09 00:25:06","style":{"id":18,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Brown Porter","shortName":"Brown Porter","description":"Brown porters are mid to dark brown (may have red tint) in color.

We've worked hard and are incredibly proud of the many successes we've enjoyed over the years. The Boston Beer Company has been cited as one of the best companies to work for by Boston Magazine, one of the Best Entry-Level Jobs by The Princeton Review, and our beers have won more awards than any other in history. Jim has been named an \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" by Inc. Magazine. Our brewers keep amazing us with innovative new brews, including Samuel Adams Utopias and our Samuel Adams Barrel Room Collection.\r\n\r\nJim has believed from the beginning that the more you know and understand about beer, the more you'll appreciate a beer like Samuel Adams Boston Lager. To begin that mission, all new employees go through intensive training on everything from ingredients, brewing, and beer styles, to taking care of the beer once it leaves the brewery. We're all beer lovers and protectors of the beer so we're trained how to identify off flavors and how to troubleshoot the causes. The passion for beer continues with an annual homebrew competition that we all take part in.\r\n\r\nOne of our wholesalers once asked Jim why he invested so much in training his people, when ultimately they might leave. Jim smiled and replied without hesitation: \"What if I didn't train them, and they stayed?\"\r\n\r\nEach year, usually in January, everyone gathers together. One of the highlights of the meeting is the beer trivia contest. With a culture so steeped in beer education and knowledge, winning is a pretty big deal. Recently, one of the hotel bartenders who was watching as the various teams arrived in costume with music and much enthusiasm and fanfare, said, \"I've always known Samuel Adams made the best beer in America, but now I see this is the greatest company in America.\" When you look around you see that The Boston Beer Company is a team of enthusiastic people who are passionate about beer and who really love coming to work every day to provide American drinkers with the best beer possible.\r\n\r\nThe Boston Beer Company, Inc. is a publicly-traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol, SAM.","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","established":"1984","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:24:45","locations":[{"id":"DF5YsC","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"30 Germania Street","locality":"Boston","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"02130","phone":"1-800-372-1131","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","latitude":42.314449,"longitude":-71.103365,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1984","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2015-12-02 19:22:03","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"MLUbXI","name":"Cincinnati","streetAddress":"1625 Central Parkway","locality":"Cincinnati","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45214","phone":"513-412-3200","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","latitude":39.1144986,"longitude":-84.5222061,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-12 13:10:57","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"XZ6L8a","name":"Production Brewery","streetAddress":"7880 Penn Drive","locality":"Breinigsville","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"18031","latitude":40.5759622,"longitude":-75.6290377,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2007","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-11-30 20:24:56","updateDate":"2015-12-02 19:22:03","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"wH0WDs","name":"Beatrice","nameDisplay":"Beatrice","abv":"7","styleId":18,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-02-29 17:21:16","updateDate":"2016-02-29 17:21:16","style":{"id":18,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Brown Porter","shortName":"Brown Porter","description":"Brown porters are mid to dark brown (may have red tint) in color.

It started with the introduction of hop farming which flourished here until the end of the 19th century. Back then, Otsego and the surrounding counties produced most of the hops grown in the United States.\r\n\r\nTraveling through the upper Susquehanna Valley towards Cooperstown in July 1898, a visitor would have enjoyed the view of hop farms with those beautiful hop vines reaching toward the midsummer sky. Grandfather Eckler ws a hop farmer and he used to say, \"The hop was King in those days!\" His hop farm was in Westville, NY only three miles up the Cherry Valley from where our Brewery is now located. When it came time for the hops to be harvested, Grandma Eckler would \"put up\" a dozen people from \"the City' and they would pick the hops for their room and board and a \"vacation\" in the country. My mother, Cynthia Eckler Hall, said she always loved it when the hop pickers came to the farm. Everyone had a lot of fun during the harvest. When the blight devastated his crop in the early 1900's, grandfather turned to dairy farming.\r\nSettled by Englishmen in the early 1800's, Cooperstown once had two English-style breweries in town. Following that tradition, the Cooperstown Brewing Company was founded in 1994. We brew premium ales, porters, and stouts using the finest two-row English barley malts, West Coast hops and the English Ringwood Yeast.\r\n\r\nGrandpa would be pleased if he could see the Brewery. We have hops growing here that survived the devastating blight to New York hop farming and those hops grown here are used to finish our Back Yard India Pale Ale.","website":"http:\/\/www.cooperstownbrewing.com\/","established":"1994","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ybdwZK\/upload_3hu6bJ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ybdwZK\/upload_3hu6bJ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ybdwZK\/upload_3hu6bJ-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ybdwZK\/upload_3hu6bJ-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ybdwZK\/upload_3hu6bJ-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:51","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:43:36","locations":[{"id":"hG1G1v","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"110 River Street","extendedAddress":"P.O.

Erika and Jeff were friends in early college years who found each other later, dated, got married, started a family, then asked each other, \u201cWhat do you really want to do in life\u2026(when you grow up)?\u201d  They liked beer, liked making beer, liked having a good time, and liked sharing their likes with others.\r\n\r\nTheir first homebrew settings were humble: Jeff\u2019s nose sticking deep into a carboy of fermenting beer in a friend's small apartment.\r\n\r\nThey evolved from the stove top with extract batches, to setting up a small, all-grain batch brewery (8 gallon kettles - Thanksgiving turkey frying pots -  on propane burners with converted coolers for mash tuns) on the back porch,  to bigger and bigger goals.  From a 5 gallon pot on the stove (with a batch of extract syrup), to a 10 gallon converted cooler (with cracked grain), and kegs turned to kettles, to working on a 15 barrel brewery creating batches that go state to state, national, international...  They made batches at home for themselves, their friends, for weddings, parties, etc..  and realized this is what they wanted to do for a job.   Jeff apprenticed with a professional brewer (local celebrity Skip Madsen of Pike, Boundary Bay, American, etc\u2026) and learned the pro angle of the trade.   They have seen the evolution, gone through it, appreciate it, and are happy to be where they are today.\r\n\r\nSalish Sea Brewing Co. is a 10 bbl (310 gallon per batch) establishment.  We hope to brew twice a week, offering a variety of ales and the occasional lager and pilsner. \r\n\r\nJeff and Erika have a  6-year-old little girl and a 2-year-old son.  They are family oriented and hope for the brewery to be family approachable.   Families are welcome, but this is a brewery with a tasting room, not a playground (we do not cater to children).  Please respect our space and the space of others.  Minors must be accompanied by an adult. \r\n\r\nOur roots are solid, our goals are lofty, but our dreams, aspirations, and hopes are high.  We want to create a place to showpiece our beers, invite your friends and families, and for you all to have a great time.\r\n\r\nThe Salish Sea Brewing Company is the real deal!\r\n\r\nWe have three 10bbl fermenters in place, the 10bbl bright tank, kettle, and mash up and running!  Please join us for a beer soon.","website":"http:\/\/salishbrewing.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/s2QjsH\/upload_H7IgFv-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/s2QjsH\/upload_H7IgFv-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/s2QjsH\/upload_H7IgFv-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/s2QjsH\/upload_H7IgFv-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/s2QjsH\/upload_H7IgFv-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-23 04:28:07","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:59:19","locations":[{"id":"RDG0mx","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"518 Dayton Street","extendedAddress":"Suite 104","locality":"Edmonds","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98020","phone":"425-582-8474","hoursOfOperation":"Wed:  3:00pm - 10:00pm\nThu:  3:00pm - 10:00pm\nFri:  12:00pm - 11:00pm\nSat:  12:00pm - 11:00pm\nSun:  12:00pm - 8:00pm\n\nClosed on Mondays.","latitude":47.8096929,"longitude":-122.3767578,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-24 13:41:23","updateDate":"2014-09-24 13:41:23","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"PjesRh","name":"Big Horn Total Disorder Porter","nameDisplay":"Big Horn Total Disorder Porter","styleId":18,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:49","updateDate":"2015-05-06 20:55:16","style":{"id":18,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Brown Porter","shortName":"Brown Porter","description":"Brown porters are mid to dark brown (may have red tint) in color.

Whole ingredients are used with traditional brewing equipment which is controlled by state of the art systems that manage temperature throughout the brewing process. These same systems harvest waste BTU's, capturing the energy that would normally be lost and reusing it to preheat ingredients, maintain product temperatures, and even heat the taproom via an in-floor heating system. Waste materials such as process water and spent grain are also captured and stored for fertilization and irrigation of our crops.\r\n\r\nThe prep table in the brewery quite often looks like the prep area in a fine restaurant. Fresh herbs, fruits and vegetables are a common sight, along with an amazing array of spices, roots and even flowers. Whole foods, fresh frozen or dried are used, artificial flavorings, extracts and coloring agents are not. The beer is unfiltered, its clarity being attained by the addition of natural clarifying agents and allowing ample time for the beer to condition.\r\n\r\nBrewery Terra Firma began brewing operations in May of 2013, with the taproom opening to the public in July of the same year.","website":"http:\/\/www.breweryterrafirma.com\/","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-11-18 12:30:28","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:48:26","locations":[{"id":"1QFuku","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2959 Hartman Rd","locality":"Traverse City","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"49685","phone":"(231) 929-1600","website":"http:\/\/www.breweryterrafirma.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  10:00am - 10:00pm\nSun:  2:00pm - 9:00pm\n\n10:00 AM to 10:00 PM Monday through Saturday, and from 2:00 PM to 9:00 PM on Sunday","latitude":44.7154521,"longitude":-85.6354376,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-11-18 12:32:00","updateDate":"2014-09-29 20:36:47","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"WAW2Ar","name":"Black Butte Porter","nameDisplay":"Black Butte Porter","description":"Our flagship beer, Black Butte Porter defined Deschutes as a place intent to follow its own brewing muse.

It continues to reap accolades and medals from those who know best.","abv":"5.2","ibu":"30","glasswareId":5,"srmId":41,"availableId":1,"styleId":18,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/WAW2Ar\/upload_XZ4WTT-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/WAW2Ar\/upload_XZ4WTT-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/WAW2Ar\/upload_XZ4WTT-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"Salmon & Wild Rice\r\nElk Burger\r\nOnion Soup","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:50","updateDate":"2015-12-15 22:22:24","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"srm":{"id":41,"name":"Over 40","hex":"000000"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":18,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Brown Porter","shortName":"Brown Porter","description":"Brown porters are mid to dark brown (may have red tint) in color.

The process of appreciation through education we call beer liberation.\r\n\r\nToday Short\u2019s Brewing Company continues the effort to educate and liberate consumers.  We take pride in our hands on, mom and pop approach and the energy we put into the quality of our beer, food, staff, customers and facilities. We believe in the power of the smallness.   We intend on remaining a smaller, state wide beer distributor and focusing our energies close to home (the SBC Michigan stimulus package).
