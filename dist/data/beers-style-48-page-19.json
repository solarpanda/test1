This made it impossible for microbreweries or small brewpubs to exist. In 1985 Uli Bennewitz went to his local senator and together they passed a bill allowing microbreweries to sell their own beer on site. A year later on the July 4th, 1986 the Weeping Radish Brewery opened for business. \r\n \r\nRaised in a small village in Bavaria, Uli was determined to bring the high quality beer he was used to across the ocean to North Carolina. A Master Brewer came over from Germany and brewed the first batches of Corolla Gold, Fest, and Black Radish. Strictly adhering to the Reinheitsgebot Purity Law of 1516, all Weeping Radish beers are brewed using hops, malt, yeast and water \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no additives, chemicals or preservatives. \r\n \r\nOur beer list has expanded over the years and currently on draft in the pub we have the OBX K\u00c3\u00b6lsch, IPA 25, and Radler as well as our original Corolla Gold, Fest and Black Radish.

Our beer styles will have a Northwestern feel, showcasing American Pale Ales, India Pale Ales, and Porters.  Our small size gives us the flexibility to introduce many unique and artistic recipes as well as our renditions of classic varieties such as Imperial Stouts, Wit beers, and Winter Warmers.  Our Head Brewer frequently traveled to Europe over the past couple years.  He has been fortunate to have experienced the wonderful beers that have historically defined many current craft beer styles.

Jason Hendricks and Jason Schlaff met in the fall of  2009.  They didn\u2019t know then that their friendship would bloom, but when it did, a brewery would be the flower.\r\n\r\nThe Jasons started humbly with a five gallon pot, a homebrew starter kit, and an idea of what good should be.  The first brew was just ok, an American Ale extract kit that did not allow for any artistry.  They quickly realized they needed to switch things up in order to attain the flavors they wanted.  So, the two amateurs ventured into the world of all-grain brewing.  The first mash tun, a cooler, the first brew, a porter.  Jason and Jason had their first failure.  \r\n\r\nPoor taste and terrible color ruined their tongues but not their spirit.  They could do much much better.   Schlaff, an avid reader and researcher, dove head first into every book he could find.  Hendricks scoured the internet and talked to every expert he could find.  Armed with brains full of knowledge the two gents embarked on the brewing adventure again.  \r\n\r\nThe second beer, a blonde ale, crafted with the newfound comprehension they acquired.  After a two weeks of eager anticipation, success!  The Jasons now had the knowledge, the drive, and the skill.  Each ale after that was instant hit among their friends and family.  Gary Schlaff, Jason\u2019s distinguished father, joined the endeavor in 2013.  Gary, a marketing genius, is nearing retirement and has decided to throw his business knowledge into the mix.\r\n\r\nThe brewery itself will not serve or prepare food.  Patrons will be allowed to bring in outside food, as well as have food delivered to them at the brewery.\r\n\r\nWe strive to be as sustainable and as local as possible.  The brewhouse and fermenters will be purchased for Psycho Brew LLC of Greenville, MI.  Our hops will be purchased from the many growers in Michigan.  Our spent grain will be sold to local farmers instead of going to waste in a landfill.  As a side project, we will also used the spent grain to made organic dog treats.","website":"http:\/\/fbcbrewing.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ohbgYE\/upload_WwIcxm-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ohbgYE\/upload_WwIcxm-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ohbgYE\/upload_WwIcxm-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ohbgYE\/upload_WwIcxm-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ohbgYE\/upload_WwIcxm-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-11-24 00:48:05","updateDate":"2016-04-10 21:15:30","locations":[{"id":"fSqavF","name":"Farmington Brewing Company","streetAddress":"33336 Grand River","locality":"Farmington","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"48336","phone":"(248) 957-9543","website":"http:\/\/fbcbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Wed:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\nThu:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\nFri:  4:00pm - 11:00pm\nSat:  2:00pm - 11:00pm\nSun:  2:00pm - 9:00pm\n\n","latitude":42.464946,"longitude":-83.375958,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2014","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-11-24 00:51:59","updateDate":"2016-04-10 21:15:14","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"cjxUOx","name":"Wheat","nameDisplay":"Wheat","styleId":48,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:44:30","updateDate":"2012-03-22 13:04:50","style":{"id":48,"categoryId":4,"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"South German-Style Hefeweizen \/ Hefeweissbier","shortName":"Hefeweizen","description":"The aroma and flavor of a Weissbier with yeast is decidedly fruity and phenolic.

They named the brewery as a nod to Kevin\u2019s love of nautical history.\r\n\r\nDry Dock expanded in 2009, and again in 2011. Now the brewery runs a 7 BBL brewhouse including a tasting room with 180 seats and 16 taps at its original location at 15120 E. Hampden Avenue which is called South Dock.\r\n\r\nIn 2013, Dry Dock nearly quadrupled its production numbers, jumping from 3,200 barrels in 2012 to 12,000 barrels in one year. This increase came with the purchase of a 30,000-square-foot production facility, North Dock, at 2801 Tower Road. At North Dock, Dry Dock has the capacity to expand to brew more than 30,000 barrels a year, and cans its flagship line of beers, including the Amber Ale, Hop Abomination, Hefeweizen, and Apricot Blonde.\r\n\r\nIn September of 2014, Dry Dock opened the Canoe Room, a four-tap tasting room inside of its North Dock facility. The tasting room, which in addition to draft beer, serves Dry Dock\u2019s canned offerings. The room was once the storage area for The Boy Scouts of America Aurora chapter\u2019s canoes and the area gained the nickname \u201cCanoe Room,\u201d which stuck.\r\n\r\nDry Dock established itself early on by word-of-mouth, and put itself on the map when it won a gold 2006 World Beer Cup (only 6 months after the tiny brewery opened) for its HMS Victory ESB (now Dry Dock\u2019s Amber Ale). Dry Dock has since been the recipient of 20 GABF\u00ae medals, the prestigious Brewers Association\u2019s Small Brewery of the Year award, and five World Beer Cup\u00ae awards.","website":"http:\/\/www.drydockbrewing.com\/","established":"2005","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/fn89yQ\/upload_HXm8qn-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/fn89yQ\/upload_HXm8qn-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/fn89yQ\/upload_HXm8qn-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/fn89yQ\/upload_HXm8qn-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/fn89yQ\/upload_HXm8qn-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:07:28","locations":[{"id":"LWD44j","name":"South Dock","streetAddress":"15120 E.
