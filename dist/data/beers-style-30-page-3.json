Rogue's first brewpub was located in Ashland, Oregon and was a 10bbl brewsystem. Rogue opened a second brewpub, 15bbl brewsystem, in May 1989 located in Newport, Oregon. Rogue closed its Ashland operation in 1997, after the great flood destroyed the place. In 1991, the 15bbl system, named Howard after John Maier's former boss, from the Newport brewpub was transferred across the bay to the current brewery and upgraded to a 30bbl system. In 1998 Rogue bought a 50bbl brewsystem, named Kobe. Kobe is the only brewsystem in use. Tours: We offer brewery tours every day at 3 pm (followed by a distillery tour at 4pm). Go up to the bar inside the brewery (Brewers on the Bay) and check in with the bartender and the tour will commence. Please call ahead if you have a large group and or to verify the tour time...Brewer's on the Bay phone is 541-867-3664.

Rogue's first brewpub was located in Ashland, Oregon and was a 10bbl brewsystem. Rogue opened a second brewpub, 15bbl brewsystem, in May 1989 located in Newport, Oregon. Rogue closed its Ashland operation in 1997, after the great flood destroyed the place. In 1991, the 15bbl system, named Howard after John Maier's former boss, from the Newport brewpub was transferred across the bay to the current brewery and upgraded to a 30bbl system. In 1998 Rogue bought a 50bbl brewsystem, named Kobe. Kobe is the only brewsystem in use. Tours: We offer brewery tours every day at 3 pm (followed by a distillery tour at 4pm). Go up to the bar inside the brewery (Brewers on the Bay) and check in with the bartender and the tour will commence. Please call ahead if you have a large group and or to verify the tour time...Brewer's on the Bay phone is 541-867-3664.

Rogue's first brewpub was located in Ashland, Oregon and was a 10bbl brewsystem. Rogue opened a second brewpub, 15bbl brewsystem, in May 1989 located in Newport, Oregon. Rogue closed its Ashland operation in 1997, after the great flood destroyed the place. In 1991, the 15bbl system, named Howard after John Maier's former boss, from the Newport brewpub was transferred across the bay to the current brewery and upgraded to a 30bbl system. In 1998 Rogue bought a 50bbl brewsystem, named Kobe. Kobe is the only brewsystem in use. Tours: We offer brewery tours every day at 3 pm (followed by a distillery tour at 4pm). Go up to the bar inside the brewery (Brewers on the Bay) and check in with the bartender and the tour will commence. Please call ahead if you have a large group and or to verify the tour time...Brewer's on the Bay phone is 541-867-3664.

SARA takes liberty in emulating those memorable beers, their brewers, and the experiences they foster, never forgetting those giants on whose shoulders we stand.\r\n\r\nOur approach to beer making is one of whimsy, highly inspired by the Belgian tradition, but also in harmony with brewers all over the world who push against boundaries of style with a nudge, not a shove. Often our beers are barrel-aged, usually in wine barrels, with various yeast and bacteria. As often as not though, Sante Adairius brews beers more approachable and traditional in nature, yet no less flavorful or distinctive.\r\n\r\nOwned and operated by us, Adair Paterno and Tim Clifford, Sante Adairius Rustic Ales is our attempt to bring people together over great beer. SARA is an expression of our many years of beer geekery, the rabbit hole of tasting every beer we could get our hands on, and trusting we could contribute to the canon of those beers of the highest esteem.

We specialize in handcrafted beer and stone oven pizzas with bottles, growlers & kegs to-go. \r\n\r\nThe restaurant, managed by Joey Arruda, serves paired pizza that is perfectly orchestrated with a focus from the water and flour to create its crust, to the fresh Italian Roma tomatoes with fresh toppings and cheeses before it is fired in stone lined ovens. \r\nWe are located at 1458 University Avenue, in the colorful and vibrant LGBT community of Hillcrest in San Diego. HBC features four initial microbrews with plans for up to twelve more to come. Pouring only grains and grapes- our 24 beers on tap and assorted selection of wines are paired with specialty pizzas, by our talented breweristas. The remainder of the taps pours \u201cGuest\u201d brews from other local micro breweries. \r\n\r\nOur tap-room, designed in-house features an open ceiling with sealed concrete floors and a 15 foot chandelier made with 97 sustainable 22oz beer bottles that will hang within a 23 foot copula. Additional clusters of hanging beer bottle chandeliers give life to a total Frankenstein set up, with much of the equipment home-made including a steam punk style bottling machine built from scratch by David White, Brewmaster\/Artist\/Mad-Scientist who lives, breathes and dreams beer. A 13 foot garage door opens to an L-Shaped outdoor patio with cushioned keg barrel seating and planters with local varietal hop bines (hop vines) that can grow up to 25+ feet along horizontal trellises.","website":"http:\/\/hillcrestbrewingcompany.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/n0PQKV\/upload_aFt73k-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/n0PQKV\/upload_aFt73k-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/n0PQKV\/upload_aFt73k-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/n0PQKV\/upload_aFt73k-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/n0PQKV\/upload_aFt73k-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-10-22 12:25:36","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:38:03","locations":[{"id":"2GV1it","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1458 University Avenue","locality":"San Diego","region":"California","postalCode":"92103","phone":"619-269-4323","website":"http:\/\/hillcrestbrewingcompany.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Fri:\t4:00 pm - 12:00 am\r\nSat - Sun:\t12:00 pm - 12:00 am","latitude":32.748559,"longitude":-117.15023,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-10-22 12:26:18","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"VuUgqE","name":"9 AM Hazelnut IPA","nameDisplay":"9 AM Hazelnut IPA","abv":"6.8","styleId":30,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-09-04 19:53:36","updateDate":"2015-04-24 15:16:49","style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

We have been hard at work building this brewery keeping in mind sustainable practices and using local materials and craftsmen. We love our town of Berlin, Maryland and hope you join us in our taproom for a couple of pints and growlers. Our goal is to produce distinctive beers whose quaility is unsurpassed using new and traditional brewing methods.\r\n\r\nWhy \"Burley Oak?\"\r\n\r\nThe inspiration for our name Burley Oak Brewing Company was derived from the name of the town, our traditional brewing methods and the history of our brewhouse. \r\n\r\nBerlin, Maryland in Wikipedia \r\nThe town of Berlin had its start around the 1790s, part of the Burley Plantation, a 300-acre (1.2 km2) land grant dating back to 1677. The name Berlin is believed to be derived from a contraction of \"Burleigh Inn\", a tavern located at the crossroads of the Philadelphia Post Road (now South Main Street) and Sinepuxent Road (Tripoli Street).\r\n\r\nIt just so happens, that our building was originally a Cooperage - making oak barrels to fill with local produce and seafood to ship off to Baltimore in the early 1900's. And we are bringing barrels back to the building, aiding us in the aging of our hand-crafted ales.","website":"http:\/\/www.burleyoak.com\/","established":"2011","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/burleyoak.us8.list-manage.com\/subscribe?u=e9e9f1b229013eb1f9c176a6d&id=08ec5affe2","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/rKXfsB\/upload_jI9hqa-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:17:12","locations":[{"id":"dB9k9t","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"10016 Old Ocean City Blvd","locality":"Berlin","region":"Maryland","postalCode":"21811","phone":"410-422-8887","website":"http:\/\/www.burleyoak.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday 11am-11pm \r\nThursday, Friday, and Saturday 11am-2am\r\nSunday 12pm - 9pm","latitude":38.3338561,"longitude":-75.2169099,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"gqS2gw","name":"About a Girl IPA","nameDisplay":"About a Girl IPA","description":"A unique IPA we originally created for one of our guests wedding, this American IPA utilizes both Cascade and Calypso hops in addition to Lemongrass to give it a nice citrusy, but strong hop presence.
