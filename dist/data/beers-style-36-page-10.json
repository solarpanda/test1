Ever since the beginnings of the American Beer Renaissance, I have wanted to brew my own great tasting beer and make it available to the beer drinking public and help people learn about and appreciate beer. Coming from Oshkosh, Wisconsin, beer brewing is in my veins.\r\n\r\nTwelve years ago my wonderful wife bought me the \"everything but the kitchen sink\" homebrew kit and it all started. After a few extract brew sessions, I built a 15 gallon brew sculpture and graduated to all-grain brewing, and things really got serious. Now after over 200 brews, BCB is in business!\r\n\r\nThe brewery is small, we call it a Nano-Brewery, we are hidden in the middle of 38 acres of woods in the heart of North Carolina. Most everything is recycled or made in-house. The Brew-House is an old 20' steel cargo container, the Beer-Garden brew patio is recycled flagstone and granite, nestled under spreading oaks and pines, our cooling water is stored rain water from a cistern, the chickens just love the spent mash. All the ingredients are as fresh as possible, some are even home grown. American malts, hops, and yeast are the mainstay of our beers. The water is from our 450' well and is just as pure and clean as can be.

The Saratoga Resort and Spa consistently draws people from all over Colorado and Wyoming due to its unique offering of a variety of amenities in one location--such as an on-site brewery, mineral hot spring pools, great food, western-styled rooms, jeep, ATV and snowmobile rentals, a golf course and a full-service spa.  \r\n\r\nThe Snowy Mountain Brewery is gaining in exposure and was featured recently in Travel Pulse\u2019s \u201c5 Unique Beer Vacation Spots in the U.S.!\u201d  The name Snowy Mountain is fitting for the brewery as it sits adjacent the majestic Snowy Range Mountains, in southern Wyoming. Boasting 8-10 different craft beers throughout each season, the Snowy Mountain Brewery is one of the fastest growing breweries in Wyoming and surrounding states. The famous brewpub, with a throw-back to the wild west, is adorned with big game mounts and bar-stools made with six-shooters and patinated saddles and features a full pub menu with selections that compliment Saratoga's finest craft beers.","website":"http:\/\/www.saratogaresortandspa.com\/snowy-mountain-brewery\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/u8Rbm0\/upload_Ayx34n-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/u8Rbm0\/upload_Ayx34n-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/u8Rbm0\/upload_Ayx34n-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/u8Rbm0\/upload_Ayx34n-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/u8Rbm0\/upload_Ayx34n-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:26:24","locations":[{"id":"6txGoK","name":"Snowy Mountain Pub & Brewery","streetAddress":"601 Pic Pike Rd","extendedAddress":"PO Box 869","locality":"Saratoga","region":"Wyoming","postalCode":"82331","phone":"307-326-5261","website":"http:\/\/www.saratogaresortandspa.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Hours: 11am to Close, Daily","latitude":41.4529922,"longitude":-106.8015215,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2015-06-04 18:45:46","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"hmRJ0p","name":"Dirty Blonde Ale","nameDisplay":"Dirty Blonde Ale","description":"Our refreshing golden craft ale will quickly become a spring and Summer favorite.

This facility will be capable of producing up to 100,000 barrels per year, in stark contrast to the system in Springfield, that is maxed out at about 4000 barrels produced in 2012.\r\nOur state of the art equipment and the facility are all built with every opportunity toward a green foot print, including the most efficient lighting, boiler, solar heating, etc.. available today.\r\nThe new facility has a large tasting room and outdoor patio and also has limited food service, to allow customers to enjoy all of our craft brews in a very comfortable setting, and with enough parking and outdoor area to support large parties!","website":"http:\/\/www.hopvalleybrewing.com\/","established":"2009","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/8IJKF0\/upload_DhZACn-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/8IJKF0\/upload_DhZACn-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/8IJKF0\/upload_DhZACn-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/8IJKF0\/upload_DhZACn-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/8IJKF0\/upload_DhZACn-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:15:36","locations":[{"id":"dqfA53","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"980 Kruse Way","locality":"Springfield","region":"Oregon","postalCode":"97477","phone":"(541) 744-3330","website":"http:\/\/www.hopvalleybrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Thu: 11:00 am - 11:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:00 am - 1:00 am\r\nSun: 11:00 am - 11:00 pm","latitude":44.082956,"longitude":-123.039863,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2009","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"OTt7Vx","name":"Hop Valley Brewing Co.","streetAddress":"990 W.1st Ave","locality":"Eugene","region":"Oregon","postalCode":"97402","phone":"541-485-2337","website":"http:\/\/www.hopvalleybrewing.com","hoursOfOperation":"11:30am-10:00pm Sunday-Wednesday\r\n11:30am-11:00pm Thursday-Saturday","latitude":44.05819,"longitude":-123.107531,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-13 00:51:08","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"WbQBKu","name":"Double D Blonde","nameDisplay":"Double D Blonde","description":"Engineered for the domestic beer drinker, this blonde ale has a mild bitterness and solf floral aroma.","abv":"4.1","ibu":"20","availableId":1,"styleId":36,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","originalGravity":"1.044","createDate":"2015-02-26 18:25:07","updateDate":"2015-02-26 18:50:20","available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":36,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Golden or Blonde Ale","shortName":"Blonde","description":"Golden or Blonde ales are straw to golden blonde in color.
