That's the way we felt before River Horse.  We were finance geeks living in a world without soul.  Grinding it out everyday for a fee, wearing suits and kissing butt.\r\n\r\nThen this brewery chose us...she forced us to ask ourselves, \"Is this desk job really how I pictured my life?\"  We answered that questions by taking over River Horse in 2007 and have not looked back.  We may not end up as the greatest success story on earth, but at least we had the balls to try.  Sometimes, for better or worse, your dreams get the best of you.\r\n\r\nJust remember, it's a big world out there and cubicles don't have doors, so you can walk out anytime.  Come see us when you can.  We are located in Lambertville, NJ on the banks of the Delaware.  Thanks for supporting the cause.

After homebrewing on the family farm for years, homebrewer Cory Schroeder teamed up with Jim Wiesender to found the brewery in 1999.\r\n\r\nUsing equipment scrounged from various industries, such as a converted pudding tank for the brew kettle, the pair launched a successful business, brewing the beer just steps away from the chicken coop and a busy dairy farm.\r\n\r\nTheir Sand Creek Golden Ale and English Style Special Ale, available only on draft and in half-gallon growlers, soon developed a reputation throughout Wisconsin's many brew fests. With a capacity of only about 150 barrels per year, the brewery, now with a third owner on board, quickly outgrew the little farm shed converted into a brewhouse.\r\n\r\nHoping to remain in the Dunn\/St. Croix counties area, the company looked for a suitable place to relocate, but came up empty handed. Then opportunity knocked in the form of a phone call one evening from their friend in Black River Falls, Pioneer brewing's brewmaster Todd Krueger. The brewery was for sale.\r\n\r\nIn March of 2004 the combined forces of the two breweries officially formed the new Sand Creek Brewing Co. of Black River Falls, Wisconsin.","website":"http:\/\/www.sandcreekbrewing.com\/","established":"1999","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gsADrL\/upload_RPFu23-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gsADrL\/upload_RPFu23-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gsADrL\/upload_RPFu23-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gsADrL\/upload_RPFu23-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/gsADrL\/upload_RPFu23-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:56:58","locations":[{"id":"TSKxwK","name":"Sand Creek Brewing Co","streetAddress":"320 Pierce St","extendedAddress":"Box 187","locality":"Black River Falls","region":"Wisconsin","postalCode":"54615","phone":"(715) 284-7553","website":"http:\/\/www.sandcreekbrewing.com\/","latitude":44.2830622,"longitude":-90.7913227,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1998","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2015-12-04 17:57:24","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"kngpZS","name":"Otis Milk Stout","nameDisplay":"Otis Milk Stout","abv":"6","styleId":20,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-02-24 23:21:53","updateDate":"2014-02-25 12:04:08","style":{"id":20,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Sweet or Cream Stout","shortName":"Sweet Stout","description":"Sweet stouts, also referred to as cream stouts, have less roasted bitter flavor and a full-bodied mouthfeel.

We highlight the beauty of the Southern Sierras that run along the Eastern side of the San Joaquin Valley that include landmarks such as Yosemite National Park, Sierra National Forest, Sequoia National Park, Kings Canyon National Park, and Sequoia National Forest. We also integrate and feature local flavor, creativity, and culture in our products to give our valley residents a sense of pride in what they drink and support.\r\n\r\nOur award-winning Brewmaster, Kevin Cox, has been spent over 20 years in the brewing industry. He began his career as a cellar master\/production manager for Heitz Wine Cellars in the Napa Valley from 1979-1989. He then moved to Fresno to help in the founding of Butterfield Brewing Company, a San Joaquin Valley favorite for many years. Butterfields Brewing Company evolved into Sequoia Brewing Co in 2003 and during his tenure with both breweries he won five gold medals at the Great American Beer Festival in Denver, Colorado, as well as numerous regional and State awards. In 2010 Kevin became head brewmaster at Tioga-Sequoia Brewing Co. and helped to build our current downtown brewery.\r\n\r\nAll Tioga-Sequoia products are brewed in downtown Fresno, California. We recently renovated our grain warehouse to become a tasting room in a Beer Garden style fashion. Our hope is that the #TSBeerGarden will bring new life to our city\u2019s downtown with an outdoor venue that provides a unique variety of fresh, local craft beer with an urban atmosphere. We host numerous types of events monthly that include live music, art shows, and food trucks. The Beer Garden has regular hours for onsite consumption with bottles, kegs and growlers to go.","website":"http:\/\/www.tioga-sequoia.com","established":"2007","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/f3JwxU\/upload_Eujdf7-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/f3JwxU\/upload_Eujdf7-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/f3JwxU\/upload_Eujdf7-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/f3JwxU\/upload_Eujdf7-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/f3JwxU\/upload_Eujdf7-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-08-19 16:26:44","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:15:10","locations":[{"id":"wdjaPp","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"745 Fulton St.","locality":"Fresno","region":"California","phone":"(559) 486-2337","latitude":36.7314814,"longitude":-119.7881204,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-08-19 19:20:56","updateDate":"2015-08-19 19:20:56","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"91cSoc","name":"Pinstripe Stout","nameDisplay":"Pinstripe Stout","description":"Pinstripe Stout is a roasty, vanilla, chocolate, coffee stout that is big and rich, but not over the top in its intensity and strength.

At the back of the mouth, the warming, rich alcohol taste is leaves a lasting impression. The aftertaste is mostly coffee and vanilla notes.

Then you add a couple hundred pound of sugar to the brew kettle, it\u2019s almost like adding sweetner to a giant cup of coffee. What makes this a milk stout is the addition of milk sugar, or lactose sugar, to the wort. Yeast can\u2019t eat this sugar so it remains behind after fermentation as a natural sweetner. Trying to get the ballance between the milk sugar sweetness and the bitterness of the roasted malts is probably the trickiest part of this entire brew.

Nick and Simon brewed intense balanced beers that were and still remain \u201cnot normal\u201d by conventional standards.\r\n\r\nIn November of 2005, after receiving numerous visitors to the brewery over the years, Three Floyds opened its own brewpub at the production facility. What was once office space is now a refuge for the craft beer enthusiast. With all the Three Floyds mainstays, seasonal offerings, special small batch beers and many guest beers it is a mecca for craft beer.

We also integrate and feature local flavor, creativity, and culture in our products to give our valley residents a sense of pride in what they drink and support.\r\n\r\nOur award-winning Brewmaster, Kevin Cox, has been spent over 20 years in the brewing industry. He began his career as a cellar master\/production manager for Heitz Wine Cellars in the Napa Valley from 1979-1989. He then moved to Fresno to help in the founding of Butterfield Brewing Company, a San Joaquin Valley favorite for many years. Butterfields Brewing Company evolved into Sequoia Brewing Co in 2003 and during his tenure with both breweries he won five gold medals at the Great American Beer Festival in Denver, Colorado, as well as numerous regional and State awards. In 2010 Kevin became head brewmaster at Tioga-Sequoia Brewing Co. and helped to build our current downtown brewery.\r\n\r\nAll Tioga-Sequoia products are brewed in downtown Fresno, California. We recently renovated our grain warehouse to become a tasting room in a Beer Garden style fashion. Our hope is that the #TSBeerGarden will bring new life to our city\u2019s downtown with an outdoor venue that provides a unique variety of fresh, local craft beer with an urban atmosphere. We host numerous types of events monthly that include live music, art shows, and food trucks. The Beer Garden has regular hours for onsite consumption with bottles, kegs and growlers to go.","website":"http:\/\/www.tioga-sequoia.com","established":"2007","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/f3JwxU\/upload_Eujdf7-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/f3JwxU\/upload_Eujdf7-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/f3JwxU\/upload_Eujdf7-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/f3JwxU\/upload_Eujdf7-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/f3JwxU\/upload_Eujdf7-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-08-19 16:26:44","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:15:10","locations":[{"id":"wdjaPp","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"745 Fulton St.","locality":"Fresno","region":"California","phone":"(559) 486-2337","latitude":36.7314814,"longitude":-119.7881204,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-08-19 19:20:56","updateDate":"2015-08-19 19:20:56","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"ub1MjE","name":"S'more Sassiness","nameDisplay":"S'more Sassiness","description":"Imperial S\u2019more Stout","abv":"9","srmId":41,"styleId":20,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-28 14:43:58","updateDate":"2015-02-28 14:43:58","srm":{"id":41,"name":"Over 40","hex":"000000"},"style":{"id":20,"categoryId":1,"category":{"id":1,"name":"British Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Sweet or Cream Stout","shortName":"Sweet Stout","description":"Sweet stouts, also referred to as cream stouts, have less roasted bitter flavor and a full-bodied mouthfeel.

They also take time to push the limits of brewing with the \"Brick Mason\" series, which the staff sees as their continuing masterpiece. Highlights from this series include \"The Lost Years\" old ale, \"Black-Eye Rye\" American black ale, and the most recent release \"20th Anniversary\", a 10% Imperial stout that was aged in Buffalo Trace bourbon barrels. Early accolades have already compared it to the hallowed KBS.\r\n\r\nThe future keeps looking brighter and brighter for this brewery, and the next couple years will see them growing and experimenting with diverse styles, collaborating with fellow breweries, implementing a new barrel program, and continuing to raise the bar for themselves in all aspects.

We've worked hard and are incredibly proud of the many successes we've enjoyed over the years. The Boston Beer Company has been cited as one of the best companies to work for by Boston Magazine, one of the Best Entry-Level Jobs by The Princeton Review, and our beers have won more awards than any other in history. Jim has been named an \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" by Inc. Magazine. Our brewers keep amazing us with innovative new brews, including Samuel Adams Utopias and our Samuel Adams Barrel Room Collection.\r\n\r\nJim has believed from the beginning that the more you know and understand about beer, the more you'll appreciate a beer like Samuel Adams Boston Lager. To begin that mission, all new employees go through intensive training on everything from ingredients, brewing, and beer styles, to taking care of the beer once it leaves the brewery. We're all beer lovers and protectors of the beer so we're trained how to identify off flavors and how to troubleshoot the causes. The passion for beer continues with an annual homebrew competition that we all take part in.\r\n\r\nOne of our wholesalers once asked Jim why he invested so much in training his people, when ultimately they might leave. Jim smiled and replied without hesitation: \"What if I didn't train them, and they stayed?\"\r\n\r\nEach year, usually in January, everyone gathers together. One of the highlights of the meeting is the beer trivia contest. With a culture so steeped in beer education and knowledge, winning is a pretty big deal. Recently, one of the hotel bartenders who was watching as the various teams arrived in costume with music and much enthusiasm and fanfare, said, \"I've always known Samuel Adams made the best beer in America, but now I see this is the greatest company in America.\" When you look around you see that The Boston Beer Company is a team of enthusiastic people who are passionate about beer and who really love coming to work every day to provide American drinkers with the best beer possible.\r\n\r\nThe Boston Beer Company, Inc. is a publicly-traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol, SAM.","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","established":"1984","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1wSztN\/upload_C4C7qF-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:24:45","locations":[{"id":"DF5YsC","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"30 Germania Street","locality":"Boston","region":"Massachusetts","postalCode":"02130","phone":"1-800-372-1131","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","latitude":42.314449,"longitude":-71.103365,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1984","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:47","updateDate":"2015-12-02 19:22:03","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"MLUbXI","name":"Cincinnati","streetAddress":"1625 Central Parkway","locality":"Cincinnati","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45214","phone":"513-412-3200","website":"http:\/\/www.samueladams.com\/","latitude":39.1144986,"longitude":-84.5222061,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-08-12 13:10:57","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"XZ6L8a","name":"Production Brewery","streetAddress":"7880 Penn Drive","locality":"Breinigsville","region":"Pennsylvania","postalCode":"18031","latitude":40.5759622,"longitude":-75.6290377,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"production","locationTypeDisplay":"Production Facility","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2007","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-11-30 20:24:56","updateDate":"2015-12-02 19:22:03","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"dffvoZ","name":"Saranac Vanilla Stout","nameDisplay":"Saranac Vanilla Stout","description":"Few ingredients rival vanilla's ability to add richness and roundness to food.
