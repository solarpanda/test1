In 1848, during the German Revolution, Bernhard Stroh, having apprenticed at his father side, immigrated to the United States. He established his own brewery in Detroit in 1850. Stroh named his new company Lion's Head Brewery, adopting the Lion's Crest logo from the Kyrburg Castle in Germany \u2013 the same crest that adorns Stroh beers today\r\n\r\nAfter establishing the brewery, Bernhard's son, Bernhard Jr., continued its expansion. A firm proponent of tradition and quality, he introduced the European method of fire-brewing to America. The fire-brewing process uses a direct flame rather than steam to heat beer-filled copper kettles. The resulting higher temperatures intensify the aroma and body of beer, resulting in a more flavorful brew.\r\n\r\nDuring Prohibition, the Stroh family operated the business under the name The Stroh Products Company, producing near beer (beer with its alcohol extracted), birch beer, soft drinks, malt products, ice cream, and ice. Though production of most of these items ceased when Prohibition ended in 1933, Stroh Ice Cream can still be enjoyed at parlors today.\r\n\r\nThe Stroh Brewery grew alongside the other titans of Detroit industry. In 1964 the company made its first move toward expansion when it bought the Goebel Brewing Company, with an eye towards national distribution. As other national brands began to enter the Detroit market, Stroh began to aggressively pursue other markets.\r\n\r\nIn 1973, Peter Stroh's willingness to depart from years of tradition enabled Stroh's to survive, but the changes were hard to swallow for many Stroh's employees. Stroh broke the company's tradition of family management and recruited managers from other companies.

The process of appreciation through education we call beer liberation.\r\n\r\nToday Short\u2019s Brewing Company continues the effort to educate and liberate consumers.  We take pride in our hands on, mom and pop approach and the energy we put into the quality of our beer, food, staff, customers and facilities. We believe in the power of the smallness.   We intend on remaining a smaller, state wide beer distributor and focusing our energies close to home (the SBC Michigan stimulus package).

In 1996 the brewery was installed by New World Brewing Systems in the space behind our retail store and production began in September. In May of 2005 we open our second brewery in Scripps Ranch.  We currently distribute five of our favorite beers, Yellowtail Pale Ale,  Calico Amber Ale , Big Eye I.P.A., Black Marlin Porter and Wahoo Wheat Beer to a thirsty San Diego.  Come to our brewery and we will gladly give you a tour and allow you to sample our newest selection of beers. Currently our beer is available in twelve ounce bottles to 15.5 gallon kegs. We also offer half gallon and gallon glass jugs to go. Kegs are available for rent to the public with a minimum deposit.  The name for our brewery comes from the point where Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo first set foot in California. Located on the Point Loma Peninsula, Ballast Point is considered the gateway to San Diego Harbor. Stones from this area were used as ballast in the cargo holds of sailing ships returning to the eastern seaboard. Many New England streets are still lined with the cobblestones brought back from San Diego.","website":"http:\/\/www.ballastpoint.com\/","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/1d90Lc\/upload_CBRgJp-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:45","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:39:04","locations":[{"id":"PckBjw","name":"Home Brew Mart","streetAddress":"5401 Linda Vista Road","extendedAddress":"#406","locality":"San Diego","region":"California","postalCode":"92110","phone":"(619) 295-2337","website":"http:\/\/www.ballastpoint.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Tasting Room & Store Hours\r\nMonday-Friday, 11:00-7:00\r\nSaturday-Sunday, 10:00-5:00","latitude":32.7667586,"longitude":-117.1952129,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:45","updateDate":"2014-09-29 20:33:49","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"a7VHpi","name":"Scripps Ranch Brewery","streetAddress":"10051 Old Grove Rd","locality":"San Diego","region":"California","postalCode":"92131","phone":"(858) 695-2739","website":"http:\/\/www.ballastpoint.com\/","latitude":32.898466,"longitude":-117.110794,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-12-07 00:05:42","updateDate":"2015-06-11 14:39:57","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"cLcfTf","name":"Tasting Room & Kitchen","streetAddress":"2215 India St","locality":"San Diego","region":"California","postalCode":"92101","phone":"(619) 255-7213","website":"http:\/\/www.ballastpoint.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  11:00am - 11:00pm\nTue:  11:00am - 11:00pm\nWed:  11:00am - 11:00pm\nThu:  11:00am - 11:00pm\nFri:  11:00am - 11:00pm\nSat:  11:00am - 11:00pm\nSun:  11:00am - 9:00pm\n\n","latitude":32.7277143,"longitude":-117.1697202,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-03-21 12:03:59","updateDate":"2015-06-11 13:48:56","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"1zYgG4","name":"Miramar","streetAddress":"9045 Carroll Way","locality":"San Diego","region":"California","postalCode":"92121","phone":"8587906900","website":"www.ballastpoint.com","latitude":32.8881618,"longitude":-117.1580141,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2014","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-06-09 16:08:18","updateDate":"2015-06-16 14:59:03","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"gRg0OA","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"9045 Carroll Way","locality":"San Diego","region":"California","postalCode":"92121","phone":"8587906900","website":"www.ballastpoint.com","hoursOfOperation":"Mon\u2013Sat 11:00am\u201311:00pm\r\nSunday 11:00am\u20139:00pm","latitude":32.8881618,"longitude":-117.1580141,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2015-06-09 20:31:45","updateDate":"2015-06-16 14:59:48","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"kr3KqQ","name":"Ballast Point Long Beach","streetAddress":"110 N.

We opened on March 25, 2011. The restaurant serves lunch and dinner with approximately 90 seats inside plus 35 seats of outside patio dining. We offer family friendly dining with a children\u2019s play area, as well as a private meeting room for business gatherings and presentations or private events, all within full view of our own brewery.  \r\n\r\nThe restaurant is very much \u201cfarm-to-fork,\u201d working closely with North Carolina pasture raised beef farmers supplying beef with no hormones added and antibiotic-free meat that we grind daily to make our hamburgers and all-beef hotdogs.  We work with other farmers growing vegetables such as tomatoes, cucumbers for pickles, and lettuce. The menu is streamlined with most items produced on-site including house made buns, sauerkraut and bacon. We use no artificial sweeteners, no high fructose corn syrup, and no hydrogenated oils.  We like to say we are like fine dining in a burger joint.  We make the mustard, the slaw, the pickles, the mayo, the aioli, the hotdogs, the relish, the...\r\n\r\nWe are also a full scale working brewery and brew our own beer.  We have up to eight beers on-tap at any given time creating fresh ales and lagers rotating seasonally throughout the year. We use just malt, hops, yeast and water to craft our beer, leaving out adjuncts and additives. We take wine seriously and feature farmer made, estate grown and bottled wines from around the world, which are served on-tap via the Enomatic self-serve wine-dispensing machine.\r\n\r\nCentral to Bull City Burger and Brewery\u2019s core values is sustainability; our attempt is to operate while leaving the smallest energy footprint possible.  Our long term goal is to become part of a cycle of energy with the restaurant playing an integral role in the farms we source. Grain left over from the brewing process will feed locally farmed pigs that provide pork bellies to make our bacon, and the fry oil will become bio-diesel to fuel vehicles.","website":"http:\/\/www.bullcityburgerandbrewery.com\/","established":"2011","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/visitor.r20.constantcontact.com\/manage\/optin\/ea?v=001qie9IeSPzo4U1KgkEFG5EQ%3D%3D","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/eu1cAn\/upload_OCIvTW-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/eu1cAn\/upload_OCIvTW-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/eu1cAn\/upload_OCIvTW-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/eu1cAn\/upload_OCIvTW-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/eu1cAn\/upload_OCIvTW-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:12:44","locations":[{"id":"vGotFH","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"107 East Parrish Street","extendedAddress":"Suite 105","locality":"Durham","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"27701","phone":"919-680-2333","website":"http:\/\/www.bullcityburgerandbrewery.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Monday - Thursday: 11:11am to 10pm\r\nFriday & Saturday:  11:11am to 11pm-ish\r\nClosed Sundays","latitude":35.995445,"longitude":-78.899939,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:49","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"aONmEh","name":"Stormy Lager","nameDisplay":"Stormy Lager","description":"Stormy Lager was inspired by Melbourne\u2019s weather.

We've worked hard and are incredibly proud of the many successes we've enjoyed over the years. The Boston Beer Company has been cited as one of the best companies to work for by Boston Magazine, one of the Best Entry-Level Jobs by The Princeton Review, and our beers have won more awards than any other in history. Jim has been named an \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" by Inc. Magazine. Our brewers keep amazing us with innovative new brews, including Samuel Adams Utopias and our Samuel Adams Barrel Room Collection.\r\n\r\nJim has believed from the beginning that the more you know and understand about beer, the more you'll appreciate a beer like Samuel Adams Boston Lager. To begin that mission, all new employees go through intensive training on everything from ingredients, brewing, and beer styles, to taking care of the beer once it leaves the brewery. We're all beer lovers and protectors of the beer so we're trained how to identify off flavors and how to troubleshoot the causes. The passion for beer continues with an annual homebrew competition that we all take part in.\r\n\r\nOne of our wholesalers once asked Jim why he invested so much in training his people, when ultimately they might leave. Jim smiled and replied without hesitation: \"What if I didn't train them, and they stayed?\"\r\n\r\nEach year, usually in January, everyone gathers together.
