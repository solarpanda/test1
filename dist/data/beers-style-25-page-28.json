It\u2019s mostly Maris Otter Pale malt with a healthy dose of Munich. Then we added some Melanoiden and CaraGold for body and sweetness, along with a touch of Torrified Wheat to give at that nice lacey head. \r\n Our Malt comes from Warminster Maltings, a traditional Victorian floor malt house just down the road in Wiltshire. They produce the finest malts available and are a thoroughly nice bunch. \r\n There are quite a few hops in here, so plenty going on.

This beer is made almost entirely from a traditional British Pale malt called Maris Otter, regarded around the world as one of the best beer making malts ever produced, with a little bit of CaraGold for sweetness and body, and some Torrified Wheat for keeping that nice white head all fluffy. \r\n Our Malt comes from Warminster Maltings, a traditional Victorian floor malt house just down the road in Wiltshire. They produce the finest malts available and are a thoroughly nice bunch. \r\n This beer is packed full of Citra hops. Citra is a wonderfully potent, resinous and ballsy hop. It\u2019s loaded with citrus notes and anything else your tastebuds may care to pick up, from guava to stone fruit. The hop has only been around since 2009 but has exploded onto the craft beer scene and has become a firm favourite for hop heads. \r\n The Citra is balanced with the more subtle, but wonderfully warm Summer hop from Australia, adding flavours like melon and apricot to round off the crazy citrus.","abv":"6","ibu":"45","styleId":25,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","originalGravity":"1.057","createDate":"2015-07-30 14:44:00","updateDate":"2015-07-30 14:44:00","style":{"id":25,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"American Pale","description":"American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.

We\u2019re a small team with big dreams and tend to smile while we sweat. We brew those styles which are most compelling to our thirst and we certainly hope you enjoy our brews as much as we do.\r\n\r\nRhinegeist means \u201cghost of the Rhine\u201d, and refers to our place here in the historic Brewery District in the Over the Rhine neighborhood of Cincinnati. At the turn of the century, this neighborhood was home to nearly 45,o00 inhabitants, most of them of German descent and 38 breweries. We hope to engender the spirit of camaraderie and hard work that we imagine those living and brewing in this neighborhood at that time embodied.\r\n\r\nWe self distribute our beer, which means each beer that you drink in a bar or restaurant is poured from a keg that we delivered cold in our refrigerated van (keep your eyes peeled for it around town). We like to keep beer as fresh as possible, which means that every keg we fill is immediately moved into cold storage where it sits until we load it onto our refrigerated van for delivery to the coldbox of each local account. Fresh beer is tasty beer, and that\u2019s our favorite kind.","website":"http:\/\/rhinegeist.com","established":"2013","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0s8yID\/upload_aZOo67-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0s8yID\/upload_aZOo67-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0s8yID\/upload_aZOo67-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0s8yID\/upload_aZOo67-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/0s8yID\/upload_aZOo67-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-06-22 18:23:27","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:43:57","locations":[{"id":"202T0m","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1910 Elm St","locality":"Cincinnati","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45202","phone":"(513) 381-1356","website":"http:\/\/rhinegeist.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Thursday 4pm - 11pm\r\nFriday 4pm - 12am\r\nSaturday 12pm - 12am\r\nSunday 12pm - 7pm","latitude":39.1168193,"longitude":-84.5201739,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-06-22 18:26:59","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Ldlw0P","name":"I Burnt My F*&cking Toast","nameDisplay":"I Burnt My F*&cking Toast","abv":"6.6","styleId":25,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-12-01 15:48:47","updateDate":"2015-12-01 15:48:48","style":{"id":25,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"American Pale","description":"American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.

All the equipment was removed and brought back to Lakewood, New York and set up at its new 10,000 square foot home, The Southern Tier Brewing Company. The Brewery began operations in February 2004 distributing regionally. By 2005 sales covered the majority of the New York State and the eastern half of Pennsylvania. In the beginning their two Flagship brands were a Pilsner and Mild Ale. Oh yeah they also brewed IPA! As it turned out the flagships were a flop and the IPA was a huge success. They next launched a line of seasonal beers which have gained great success. Since the beginning, Southern Tier has experienced steady growth, currently distributing to over 25% of the United States. Multiple expansions have been made to keep up with demand and the brewery continues to be innovative by producing new products.

That's when the first batches of home-brewed beer began appearing and David's wife Lori began to realize that her husband was forming a lifetime passion.  David's passion would continue to grow and evolve.  He learned the tradition of brewing in America.  The history of small family owned breweries that we able to serve fresh handcrafted beer to their local communities.  The fact that the these small local breweries became points of pride in the community and that the businesses would stay in the family for generations.  \r\n \r\nAn idea began to grow.  The idea that despite the brewing world we live in now with mega breweries pumping out mass marketed bland beer, that a small locally owned brewery making fresh unique beer could again be a source of pride for a community.  David dreamed of recreating this American brewing tradition and so set out on his way to do just that.\r\n \r\nDavid spent the next 7 years honing his craft.  Learning about beer styles and brewing techniques.  Winning contests with his beer and defining a unique style for quality and consistency.  In 2012 the wheels were set into motion for our brewery when David met Tyler Meusburger, a colleague with a passion for entrepreneurship and creativity.  Working together they began building a business plan and putting financing into place, and in Nov of 2013 David and Tyler brewed the first batch of beer at New American Brewing Co.\r\n \r\nWe look forward to continuing our story and living a \"New Tradition\" of American brewing.\r\n \r\nDrink American!","website":"http:\/\/www.newamericanbeer.com","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/RHn3Pm\/upload_95vyk6-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/RHn3Pm\/upload_95vyk6-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/RHn3Pm\/upload_95vyk6-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/RHn3Pm\/upload_95vyk6-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/RHn3Pm\/upload_95vyk6-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-07-25 14:17:39","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:56:45","locations":[{"id":"ZK7bhN","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1460 NE 69th Pl Suite 67","locality":"Ankeny","region":"Iowa","postalCode":"50021","phone":"515-250-8703","website":"http:\/\/www.newamericanbeer.com","latitude":41.6863399,"longitude":-93.5994046,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-07-25 14:20:32","updateDate":"2014-07-25 14:20:32","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"YRydPA","name":"India Pale Ale","nameDisplay":"India Pale Ale","styleId":25,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:28","updateDate":"2012-03-22 13:04:39","style":{"id":25,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"American Pale","description":"American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.
