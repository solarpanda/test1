We brew in small batches and use several strains of yeast to produce our beers.   The drinker may notice slight nuances from batch to batch.

This results in a unique drinking experience each time a bottle is opened.\r\n\r\nHere at Draai Laag we like to cater to those that want something respectful of tradition, but ultimately different.  Those who are not satisfied drinking the norm.  Most importantly, we get our biggest enjoyment and fulfillment not from profit, but from your smile after the first sip.\r\n\r\nThis company was built on the dream of doing what we love and following our passion.

There is a small barrel shed on the shady, north side of the garage.","website":"http:\/\/www.alpinebeerco.com\/","established":"2002","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/vDxSPd\/upload_xSpAaB-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/vDxSPd\/upload_xSpAaB-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/vDxSPd\/upload_xSpAaB-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/vDxSPd\/upload_xSpAaB-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/vDxSPd\/upload_xSpAaB-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:38:34","locations":[{"id":"AfyZtJ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2351 Alpine Boulevard","locality":"Alpine","region":"California","postalCode":"91901","phone":"619-445-2337","website":"http:\/\/www.alpinebeerco.com\/","latitude":32.8351688,"longitude":-116.7626655,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2002","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:44","updateDate":"2015-12-03 19:11:21","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"8hZ9IU","name":"Nouveau Bruin","nameDisplay":"Nouveau Bruin","styleId":57,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/8hZ9IU\/upload_d1UVQ8-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/8hZ9IU\/upload_d1UVQ8-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/8hZ9IU\/upload_d1UVQ8-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-11-27 12:48:50","updateDate":"2015-12-17 08:26:56","style":{"id":57,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Flanders Oud Bruin or Oud Red Ales","shortName":"Flanders Red","description":"This light- to medium-bodied deep copper to brown ale is characterized by a slight to strong lactic sourness, and with \"Reds\" sometimes a balanced degree of acetic acid.

Brad Lincoln first experienced craft beer while working as an accountant in Portland, OR. The two met during the winter of 2009 while attending the Siebel Institute and studying brewing science. After being immersed in beer for the better part of five months, the two graduated and shared a desire to open a brewery. This resulted in the Saison-focused brewery that is now Funkwerks, opening December 9, 2010.\r\n \r\nSaisons originated as Belgian farmhouse ales- brewed during winter months for the farm workers during the summer months. Usually having a dry profile and complex fruity aromas, Saisons today are brewed year-round and generally have a higher alcohol percentage than their original versions.\r\n \r\nFunkwerks\u2019 two flagship beers, Saison and Tropic King, are produced year round. Also brewed annually are four seasonals, a number of small experimental batches, and select barrel-aged releases. Funkwerks flagship Saison was awarded a gold medal at the 2012 Great American Beer Festival (GABF) and a silver medal in 2011. Deceit, a Belgian-Style golden strong ale, was also awarded a gold medal at the GABF in 2012. In addition to receiving two gold medals in 2012, the GABF named Funkwerks the 2012 Small Brewing Company of the Year.\r\n \r\nFunkwerks is located at 1900 East Lincoln Avenue in Fort Collins, Colorado. The tasting room- complete with an indoor bar, retail area and spacious outdoor, dog-friendly patio- is open 7 days a week: Sunday through Thursday from 12pm-8pm; Friday and Saturday from 12pm-9pm.

Soft toffee notes lead with a blend of Wisconsin, British and German malts that first rested in the Coolship before spontaneously fermenting on oak in the cave. Hallertau hops, matured in the horse barn, elegantly support sparkling fruit notes that frolic before a punctuated oak finish. 100% naturally fermented in oak vessels this is an elegant beer that can be enjoyed now or the patient few can lie in their personal cellar to age.","srmId":37,"styleId":57,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"Smoked Pork Chop, Prime Rib, Farmers Cheese, Monterey Jack with Morels and Chives, Seared Peaches and Vanilla Ice Cream","createDate":"2015-01-01 02:06:41","updateDate":"2015-01-09 15:50:11","srm":{"id":37,"name":"37","hex":"3F0708"},"style":{"id":57,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Flanders Oud Bruin or Oud Red Ales","shortName":"Flanders Red","description":"This light- to medium-bodied deep copper to brown ale is characterized by a slight to strong lactic sourness, and with \"Reds\" sometimes a balanced degree of acetic acid.
