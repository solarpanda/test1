We knew what we wanted to drink, but we needed some help actually brewing it. So we enlisted our first brewer, took over some warehouse space on the Boston waterfront, and began introducing fresh, local craft beer to Boston drinkers. We tried to do it in a way that captured the spirit of fun that had brought us to beer in the first place. From that warehouse, surrounded by fish companies on the docks of South Boston (neighboring what is now the Seaport District), we couldn\u2019t imagine that craft brewing would become what it has today.  \r\n\r\nWe still remember our days on the other side of the bar, and have spent as much time spreading the joy of beer drinking as we have focusing on recipes, ingredients, and brewing equipment. Hopefully our sense of gratitude is reflected in both the quality of the beer and the spirit of fun and enjoyment surrounding our beer and breweries.

Ostentatiously amber, this Prickly Passion Saison is sure to provoke the palate with a passionate prick, turn that bottle over and take a sip.","abv":"8.5","glasswareId":5,"availableId":2,"styleId":72,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/peHhTG\/upload_ezJn81-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/peHhTG\/upload_ezJn81-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/peHhTG\/upload_ezJn81-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","originalGravity":"1.083","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:44:00","updateDate":"2015-12-16 13:06:16","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"style":{"id":72,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"French & Belgian-Style Saison","shortName":"Saison","description":"Beers in this category are golden to deep amber in color.

For Jeff Lebesch would return to Fort Collins with a handful of ingredients and an imagination full of recipes. And then there was beer. Jeff's first two basement-brewed creations? A brown dubbel with earthy undertones named Abbey and a remarkably well-balanced amber he named Fat Tire. To say the rest was history would be to overlook his wife's involvement. Kim Jordan was New Belgium's first bottler, sales rep, distributor, marketer and financial planner.

We are an artisinal nano-brewery in the city of Carpinteria, CA that focuses on creating small batch beers with an experimental approach. Rob and Steve met in 1999 and brewed their first batch of beer together in 2008. While attending UCSB, Rob met Peter while visiting Orella Ranch in Gaviota and they began brewing beer together in the Santa Barbara area. Then, in the summer of 2011, the three of them converged for a backpacking trip (pictured above) on The Lost Coast of Northern California - it was on this trip that they first discussed starting a brewery together. In late 2012 after some serious brainstorming and long meetings, the initiative had begun and planning was underway.\r\n \r\nIt is vitally important to us that we are directly involved with the production of our raw materials.  We are growing our own hops in the Santa Barbara area to supplement our usage, and in the future we plan to be growing enough to supply hops to the local community.  Our grains will be grown in the Santa Ynez Valley and malted right here in Santa Barbara.  All of our solid waste (spent grains, hops, yeast) will be fed to local pigs, local cricket farmers, or composted .  We will participate in, and contribute to, local festivals and events that revolve around brewing, environmentalism, and the promotion of local businesses.","website":"http:\/\/www.brewlabcraft.com","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/DFJoPF\/upload_AttrGR-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/DFJoPF\/upload_AttrGR-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/DFJoPF\/upload_AttrGR-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/DFJoPF\/upload_AttrGR-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/DFJoPF\/upload_AttrGR-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-04-06 17:17:38","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:07:16","locations":[{"id":"9Hqlzg","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"4191-8 Carpinteria Ave.","locality":"Carpinteria","region":"California","postalCode":"93013","phone":"949.922.9152","hoursOfOperation":"Fri:  4:00pm - 9:00pm\nSat:  4:00pm - 9:00pm\nSun:  2:00pm - 7:00pm\n\n","latitude":34.4037704,"longitude":-119.5337568,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-04-07 19:22:22","updateDate":"2015-04-07 19:22:22","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"6vnH4i","name":"Local Influence Series","nameDisplay":"Local Influence Series","description":"For this series of saisons we take the base beer, Norway Hill, and age it on fruit from local farms.

It didn't take long before the act, the ideas, and the processes of brewing began to take over our lives. Shortly thereafter we dubbed ourselves Black Pond Brews, after a pond where we had some fun and memorable times in Woodstock, CT. Within no time we were entering our beers into homebrew competitions and they were met with immediate success. Spurred by this success and by the constant clamoring of our friends and family to make more beer, we really began to ask ourselves: how do we turn this passion for producing beer into a commercial reality?\r\n \r\nOur project is not only valuable to us, but to the community in which we will operate.  Our beautiful, quiet town of Danielson, CT will become a destination for anyone who loves beer, be they local or travellers.  Who doesn't love beer?  Further, who doesn't love MORE beer to try?!\r\n \r\nWhat inspires us?\r\nThe ability to write or create something unique, something revolutionary. Clara Barton once said \u201cI defy the tyranny of precedent. I go for anything new that might improve the past\". Such a philosophy is inherent in the way we approach brewing. Breweries often spend much of their time and effort looking back to past recipes- often times as far back as the inception of brewing itself- but what of the future? What new ideas and flavors can we explore? We are always pushing the envelope against the grain- but our guiding star will always be uncompromising flavor of the highest quality.","website":"http:\/\/www.blackpondbrews.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/RBaOzm\/upload_V4dCw0-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/RBaOzm\/upload_V4dCw0-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/RBaOzm\/upload_V4dCw0-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/RBaOzm\/upload_V4dCw0-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/RBaOzm\/upload_V4dCw0-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-05-17 11:34:47","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:09:03","locations":[{"id":"t8ecnf","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"21A Furnace St","locality":"Danielson","region":"Connecticut","postalCode":"06239","phone":"860-207-5295","website":"BlackPondBrews.com","hoursOfOperation":"Thu:  5:00pm - 8:00pm\nFri:  5:00pm - 8:00pm\nSat:  3:00pm - 8:00pm\nSun:  12:00pm - 5:00pm\n\nWe are located in the basement of the beautiful Danielson Adventure Sports Building.","latitude":41.804121,"longitude":-71.883942,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"nano","locationTypeDisplay":"Nano Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-05-17 11:34:47","updateDate":"2015-05-18 14:49:59","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"PwH988","name":"MacTarnahan's Lip Stinger","nameDisplay":"MacTarnahan's Lip Stinger","description":"The first of four in a new series of specialty beers (introduced 2009-10), available August through October.","abv":"4.8","ibu":"32","glasswareId":8,"availableId":3,"styleId":72,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/PwH988\/upload_3BwaOy-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/PwH988\/upload_3BwaOy-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/PwH988\/upload_3BwaOy-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-05-09 00:36:36","updateDate":"2015-12-17 02:33:19","glass":{"id":8,"name":"Tulip","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":3,"name":"Not Available","description":"Beer is not available."},"style":{"id":72,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"French & Belgian-Style Saison","shortName":"Saison","description":"Beers in this category are golden to deep amber in color.

A favorite throughout the years, when Portlander\u2019s say \u201cGimme a Mac\u2019s\u201d it\u2019s understood they want the crisp, distinct flavor that MacTarnahan\u2019s Amber Ale is known for.","website":"http:\/\/www.portlandbrewing.com","established":"1986","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/RvOc0i\/upload_uaS0tJ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/RvOc0i\/upload_uaS0tJ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/RvOc0i\/upload_uaS0tJ-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/RvOc0i\/upload_uaS0tJ-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/RvOc0i\/upload_uaS0tJ-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:55:04","locations":[{"id":"QhISs9","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2730 NW 31st Avenue","locality":"Portland","region":"Oregon","postalCode":"97210","phone":"1-503-226-7623","website":"http:\/\/www.portlandbrewing.com","hoursOfOperation":"Monday: 11:00am - 9:00pm\r\nTuesday - Thursday: 11:00am - 10:00pm\r\nFriday: 11:00am - 11:00pm\r\nSaturday: 12:00pm - 11:00pm\r\nSunday: 12:00pm - 9:00pm","latitude":45.5413214,"longitude":-122.713156,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"UKRMrJ","name":"Mad Saison","nameDisplay":"Mad Saison","description":"Saison beers are known to be very dry due to a very high attenuation. Their secret? A specific strain of yeast of course, known to be a little \u201cwicked\u201d! Our strain has been chosen amongst 7 different strains after running many trials in laboratory. The  MAD saison is low in alcohol (5,5 % abv) with a quite present bitterness which makes it a very thirst-quenching brew! Four cereals are used as well as three hop varieties, two from Alsace and an american one for spiciness, fruitiness as well as a delicate smell of elderflower. Like most wild yeast, our season strain produce a reasonable amount of phenols which match perfectly the other hop aromas.","abv":"5.5","styleId":72,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/UKRMrJ\/upload_0p0pIx-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/UKRMrJ\/upload_0p0pIx-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/UKRMrJ\/upload_0p0pIx-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-01-30 15:15:43","updateDate":"2015-12-17 22:00:18","style":{"id":72,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"French & Belgian-Style Saison","shortName":"Saison","description":"Beers in this category are golden to deep amber in color.
