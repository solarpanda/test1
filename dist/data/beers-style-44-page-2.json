Our Imperial Stout is brewed with a combination of pale, caramel, chocolate and roasted malts. Oats are also added to give the beer a fuller and sweeter taste. The roasted malts give the beer its dark color as well as its intense flavor and aroma. After fermentation the beer is cold aged for 6 weeks. This is necessary for all of the flavors of the malt and hops to balance and produce a very smooth flavor. \r\nAfter the cold aging the beer is transferred into the bourbon barrels. It is then aged for another 8 weeks to absorb the flavors from the barrels. The result is a stout that brings out the the roasted flavors from the malt and the warming toasted, vanilla and bourbon flavors.","abv":"10","ibu":"20","srmId":41,"availableId":2,"styleId":44,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/FdsmV8\/upload_PhdImd-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/FdsmV8\/upload_PhdImd-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/FdsmV8\/upload_PhdImd-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-06-09 22:05:21","updateDate":"2016-03-18 19:01:10","srm":{"id":41,"name":"Over 40","hex":"000000"},"available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"style":{"id":44,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"Specialty Stouts","shortName":"Stout","description":"See British Origin American-Style Imperial Porter Imperial porters are very dark brown to black in color.

Rogue closed its Ashland operation in 1997, after the great flood destroyed the place. In 1991, the 15bbl system, named Howard after John Maier's former boss, from the Newport brewpub was transferred across the bay to the current brewery and upgraded to a 30bbl system. In 1998 Rogue bought a 50bbl brewsystem, named Kobe. Kobe is the only brewsystem in use. Tours: We offer brewery tours every day at 3 pm (followed by a distillery tour at 4pm). Go up to the bar inside the brewery (Brewers on the Bay) and check in with the bartender and the tour will commence. Please call ahead if you have a large group and or to verify the tour time...Brewer's on the Bay phone is 541-867-3664.

We create beers that push the boundaries of style, forcing the consumer to stop and think about the drink in front of them, to confront the misconceptions of what ale and beer should or can be, and who drinks it? \r\n\r\nAnd before you ask, yes, Gregg and Bryan do sport some very impressive facial hair. Here at Weird Beard Brew Co we are all about the beards, but not so much the sandals. We are passionate about good beer, no matter where it comes from or how it is dispensed.

They also take time to push the limits of brewing with the \"Brick Mason\" series, which the staff sees as their continuing masterpiece. Highlights from this series include \"The Lost Years\" old ale, \"Black-Eye Rye\" American black ale, and the most recent release \"20th Anniversary\", a 10% Imperial stout that was aged in Buffalo Trace bourbon barrels. Early accolades have already compared it to the hallowed KBS.\r\n\r\nThe future keeps looking brighter and brighter for this brewery, and the next couple years will see them growing and experimenting with diverse styles, collaborating with fellow breweries, implementing a new barrel program, and continuing to raise the bar for themselves in all aspects. After all, craft beer isn't just a product; it's a journey.","website":"http:\/\/www.redbrickbrewing.com\/","established":"1993","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/11gqIZ\/upload_kE3Udx-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/11gqIZ\/upload_kE3Udx-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/11gqIZ\/upload_kE3Udx-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/11gqIZ\/upload_kE3Udx-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/11gqIZ\/upload_kE3Udx-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:05:16","locations":[{"id":"QC2xF6","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2323 Defoor Hills Road","locality":"Atlanta","region":"Georgia","postalCode":"30318","phone":"404-355-5558","website":"http:\/\/www.redbrickbrewing.com\/","latitude":33.818002,"longitude":-84.435253,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1993","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:06","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"XWveu5","name":"Dock Street Walker","nameDisplay":"Dock Street Walker","description":"Brewed in honor of our favorite post apocalyptic drama...ever.
