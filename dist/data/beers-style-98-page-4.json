Pilsner","description":"A pilsner, more than any other beer, expresses the quality and craftsmanship of a brewery. Attention to every detail from ingredients, process and cellaring must be exact for it's clear subtle flavors to meld perfectly. Any flaw or blemish is immediately apparent. When you taste Gold Mt. Pilsner you taste the very best from the brewers at Silver City. It is with great pride that we are making this classic European style lager available as our newest seasonal beer starting this summer from July till September. \r\n\r\nBrewed with North American lager malt and Czechoslovakian hops and yeast, Gold Mountain Pilsner beautifully blends old world and new. A lagering period (cold storage) of 4 to 6 weeks allows this most delicate of brews to become bright and clear. At this time, the malt character is now fully developed and the entire beer has lost its rough edges becoming soft and elegant. The perfect pint for a warm summers day or any day for that matter, Gold Mt. Pilsner rewards with clean, crisp, quaffable flavor every time. Enjoy!\r\n\r\nBronze Medal - Great American Beer Festival - 2009\r\nGold Medal - Great American Beer Festival - 2006","glasswareId":4,"availableId":4,"styleId":98,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:16","updateDate":"2012-03-22 13:05:37","glass":{"id":4,"name":"Pilsner","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":4,"name":"Seasonal","description":"Available at the same time of year, every year."},"style":{"id":98,"categoryId":8,"category":{"id":8,"name":"North American Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"American-Style Pilsener","shortName":"American Pilsener","description":"This classic and unique pre-Prohibition American-style Pilsener is straw to deep gold in color.

We operated with a menu of fresh, made-to-order hamburgers, fresh cut French Fries and real ice cream shakes. Our 2nd location was here at our Silverdale location. We had fun and we still have Silver City Guests ask us about 39 cent hamburgers and grilled onion burgers. We miss 'em too, but we proved it's real hard to put the big hamburger chains out of business. It isn't as easy as it looks.\r\n\r\nIn 1996 we decided to switch gears and get into the Brewpub business. We sold our Bremerton location and remodeled the Silverdale location into what it is today.\r\n\r\nWe operate today on the same principles as we did when we opened our first Top Notch Burger. We work hard at making sure each Guest leaves happier than when they arrived. We work hard side-by-side with our staff and train them to treat their Guests like you would treat a Guest in your own home.","website":"http:\/\/www.silvercitybrewery.com\/","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/tIgHYj\/upload_A4646V-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/tIgHYj\/upload_A4646V-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/tIgHYj\/upload_A4646V-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/tIgHYj\/upload_A4646V-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/tIgHYj\/upload_A4646V-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:04:47","locations":[{"id":"XDsUGb","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2799 NW Myhre Road","locality":"Silverdale","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98383","phone":"360-698-5879","website":"http:\/\/www.silvercitybrewery.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Thurs: 11:00 am - 10:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:00 am - 11:00 pm\r\nSun: 11:00 am - 9:00 pm","latitude":47.659282,"longitude":-122.687358,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:08","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"6myj2j","name":"Gold Rush","nameDisplay":"Gold Rush","abv":"6.3","ibu":"60","styleId":98,"isOrganic":"Y","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-06-09 14:55:51","updateDate":"2015-06-09 14:55:51","style":{"id":98,"categoryId":8,"category":{"id":8,"name":"North American Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"American-Style Pilsener","shortName":"American Pilsener","description":"This classic and unique pre-Prohibition American-style Pilsener is straw to deep gold in color.

Rogue's first brewpub was located in Ashland, Oregon and was a 10bbl brewsystem. Rogue opened a second brewpub, 15bbl brewsystem, in May 1989 located in Newport, Oregon. Rogue closed its Ashland operation in 1997, after the great flood destroyed the place. In 1991, the 15bbl system, named Howard after John Maier's former boss, from the Newport brewpub was transferred across the bay to the current brewery and upgraded to a 30bbl system. In 1998 Rogue bought a 50bbl brewsystem, named Kobe. Kobe is the only brewsystem in use. Tours: We offer brewery tours every day at 3 pm (followed by a distillery tour at 4pm). Go up to the bar inside the brewery (Brewers on the Bay) and check in with the bartender and the tour will commence. Please call ahead if you have a large group and or to verify the tour time...Brewer's on the Bay phone is 541-867-3664.

His family was collecting rice from farmers as land taxes for the Mito Tokugawa family. He began his brewery with the idea of using the remaining rice stocks in the warehouse. At this time in Japan a new political movement began to reform the Tokugawa regime. Fujita Toko, one of the movement's activists, advocated an ideology to build a new organizational government with a reverence of the emperor, and his thought led to the Meiji Restoration.\r\n\r\nFujita was a close friend of Kiuchi, who named one of his sakes \"KIKUSAKARI\" as a respect to the emperor. KIKU (chrysanthemum) is a crest of the imperial household, and SAKARI means 'property'.\r\n\r\n1950's Mikio Kiuchi inherited the brewery legacy in 1950. It was the time when the sake industry flourished as the rapid growth of Japan's economy after the World War II. Although many sake breweries started mass producing low quality sake due to increased demand, Kiuchi Brewery maintained their policy of pursuing the best quality of sake with the optimum ingredients and craftsman-ship.\r\n\r\nHitachino Beer In autumn 1996, Kiuchi started beer brewing business, named the brand \"HITACHINO NEST BEER\" with unique owl character logo.\r\nOver the years, Kiuchi Brewery has gained Japan and worldwide attention by winning awards at numerous world beer competitions.\r\nIn 2000, Brew on Premises facilities has opened to introduce the Lager is the main stream in the beer industries in Japan.\r\n\r\nShochu Kiuchi Kiuchi built a Distillation facility in March, 2003. to aid with recycling and reduction of waste, beginning with the production of \"Shochu Kiuchi\" Distilled liquor made from Sakekasu (Sake lees) which is the by-product of Sake Brewing.\r\n\r\nThe wine brewing project is the latest challenge of Kiuchi Brewery. Kiuchi bought 4000 square meters of land next to the brewery for the vineyard. The grape seedlings, Merlot and Chardoney were imported from France. The vineyard produced its first crop in 2000.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, 3 tonnes of grapes were harvested producing 2000 Litres of Wine. This wine is hoped to be able to offer on a market as another prestigious Kiuchi brand in the near future...","website":"http:\/\/www.kodawari.cc\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/a2GCv8\/upload_CkHjaS-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/a2GCv8\/upload_CkHjaS-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/a2GCv8\/upload_CkHjaS-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/a2GCv8\/upload_CkHjaS-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/a2GCv8\/upload_CkHjaS-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:59","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:49:44","locations":[{"id":"01Bp2T","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1257 Kounosu","locality":"Naka-shi","region":"Ibaraki","phone":"+81 (0)29-298-0105","website":"http:\/\/www.kodawari.cc\/","latitude":36.46801,"longitude":140.475563,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"JP","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:59","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"JP","name":"JAPAN","displayName":"Japan","isoThree":"JPN","numberCode":392,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"kMzeFq","name":"Hochzeit Pilsner","nameDisplay":"Hochzeit Pilsner","glasswareId":4,"availableId":2,"styleId":98,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/kMzeFq\/upload_i87lYD-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/kMzeFq\/upload_i87lYD-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/kMzeFq\/upload_i87lYD-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:23","updateDate":"2015-12-18 15:58:21","glass":{"id":4,"name":"Pilsner","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"style":{"id":98,"categoryId":8,"category":{"id":8,"name":"North American Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"American-Style Pilsener","shortName":"American Pilsener","description":"This classic and unique pre-Prohibition American-style Pilsener is straw to deep gold in color.

Nick and Simon brewed intense balanced beers that were and still remain \u201cnot normal\u201d by conventional standards.\r\n\r\nIn November of 2005, after receiving numerous visitors to the brewery over the years, Three Floyds opened its own brewpub at the production facility. What was once office space is now a refuge for the craft beer enthusiast. With all the Three Floyds mainstays, seasonal offerings, special small batch beers and many guest beers it is a mecca for craft beer. The pub also has a full service kitchen providing pub fare of the best quality supported by a 3000 square foot organic herb and vegetable garden.","website":"http:\/\/www.3floyds.com","established":"1996","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/iodDki\/upload_Va4zor-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/iodDki\/upload_Va4zor-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/iodDki\/upload_Va4zor-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/iodDki\/upload_Va4zor-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/iodDki\/upload_Va4zor-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2016-07-29 12:02:44","locations":[{"id":"71LkGn","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"9750 Indiana Parkway","locality":"Munster","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"46321","phone":"1-219-922-3565","website":"http:\/\/www.threefloydspub.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nTue:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nWed:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nThu:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nFri:  11:30am - 2:00am\r\nSat:  12:00pm - 2:00am\r\nSun:  12:00pm - 12:00am","latitude":41.535541,"longitude":-87.516686,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2015-06-18 14:42:36","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"GoDmMT","name":"Munster","streetAddress":"9750 Indiana Parkway","locality":"Munster","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"46321","phone":"219-922-4425","website":"http:\/\/www.3floyds.com\/","latitude":41.535536,"longitude":-87.516687,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1996","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:16","updateDate":"2015-04-01 18:55:51","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"dLdtz3","name":"Hopswitch","nameDisplay":"Hopswitch","glasswareId":4,"styleId":98,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/dLdtz3\/upload_hUkPAs-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/dLdtz3\/upload_hUkPAs-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/dLdtz3\/upload_hUkPAs-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:43:26","updateDate":"2015-12-16 09:55:08","glass":{"id":4,"name":"Pilsner","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"style":{"id":98,"categoryId":8,"category":{"id":8,"name":"North American Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"American-Style Pilsener","shortName":"American Pilsener","description":"This classic and unique pre-Prohibition American-style Pilsener is straw to deep gold in color.

By the end of the 19th-Century the brewery would be one of the largest in the United States. The brewery closed its doors when Prohibition began in 1919. The brand was revived in 1981 as one of the pioneer craft beers of todays craft beer movement, with the introduction of a series of Christian Moerlein beers by the Hudepohl Brewing Company. In 1984, Christian Moerlein Lager was the first American beer ever certified by the German government to pass the German Beer Purity Law (Reinheitsgebot). After a series of sales that took the business and brewing out of the region, the company was relocated once again to Cincinnati in 2004 by Gregory Hardman, its current local owner. With the goal of returning Cincinnati's grand brewing traditions, Hardman led the effort to build a world-class Moerlein Lager House brewery\/gastropub on the banks of the Ohio River which opened in 2012 in Cincinnati's Smale Riverfront Park next to Great American Ballpark, home of the Cincinnati Reds. A spectacular craft brewing facility and Malt House Taproom opened in 2013 in the historic Over-the-Rhine brewery district, just blocks from its original 19th century home. The brewery offers tours and has a taproom in an original 1860's malt house complete with historic underground lagering cellars. The brewery is the first American craft brewer to rescue a City's heritage beer brands and owns Hudepohl-Schoenling Brewing Co. including the brands of Hudepohl, Hudy Delight, Hudy 14-K, Burger and Little Kings Cream Ale brands.","website":"http:\/\/www.christianmoerlein.com\/","established":"1853","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Em1uno\/upload_DkG1sa-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Em1uno\/upload_DkG1sa-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Em1uno\/upload_DkG1sa-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Em1uno\/upload_DkG1sa-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Em1uno\/upload_DkG1sa-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:50","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:11:17","locations":[{"id":"qo6LCf","name":"Main Brewery, General Offices and Taproom","streetAddress":"1621 Moore St.","locality":"Cincinnati","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45202","phone":"513-827-6025","website":"http:\/\/www.christianmoerlein.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Wed:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\nThu:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\nFri:  4:00pm - 12:00am\nSat:  12:00pm - 12:00am\nSun:  12:00pm - 7:00pm\n\n","latitude":39.1137948,"longitude":-84.5150108,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"tasting","locationTypeDisplay":"Tasting Room","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1853","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:50","updateDate":"2014-12-15 02:45:48","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"X0HMO8","name":"Christian Moerlein Lager House","streetAddress":"115 Joe Nuxhall Way","locality":"Cincinnati","region":"Ohio","postalCode":"45202","phone":"513-421-2337","website":"http:\/\/www.moerleinlagerhouse.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  1:00pm - 8:00pm, 11:00am - 11:00pm\nTue:  1:00pm - 8:00pm, 11:00am - 11:00pm\nWed:  1:00pm - 8:00pm, 11:00am - 11:00pm\nThu:  1:00pm - 8:00pm, 11:00am - 11:00pm\nFri:  11:00am - 10:00pm, 11:00am - 1:00am\nSat:  11:00am - 10:00pm, 11:00am - 11:00am\nSun:  12:00pm - 6:00pm, 11:00am - 10:00pm\n\n","latitude":39.0963619,"longitude":-84.5087017,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"restaurant","locationTypeDisplay":"Restaurant\/Ale House","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-02 18:10:31","updateDate":"2014-12-15 02:46:10","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]},{"id":"sitjIr","name":"Mt.

We like to keep beer as fresh as possible, which means that every keg we fill is immediately moved into cold storage where it sits until we load it onto our refrigerated van for delivery to the coldbox of each local account.
