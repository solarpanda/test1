It is an unfiltered, all-natural mild pale ale made with Maine blueberries. It is a refreshing, well balanced beer that has a crisp, fruity aroma and finishes clean and dry. The name Bass Ackwards Berryblue Ale is for its unconventional use of only fresh blueberries in the fermenter without the use of flavorings added, unlike most blueberry ales. The result is a surprisingly simple drinkability that enables you to drink more than one. Try a Black and Blue, our Bass Ackwards mixed with our rich Lake Trout Stout.","abv":"4.4","ibu":"13.4","glasswareId":5,"srmId":21,"availableId":6,"styleId":119,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/ygdUGF\/upload_iM8UXq-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/ygdUGF\/upload_iM8UXq-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/ygdUGF\/upload_iM8UXq-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","foodPairings":"light fare, salads, easy drinking","originalGravity":"1.048","createDate":"2012-04-23 15:16:01","updateDate":"2015-12-16 16:56:39","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"srm":{"id":21,"name":"21","hex":"952D00"},"available":{"id":6,"name":"Summer","description":"Available during the summer months."},"style":{"id":119,"categoryId":11,"category":{"id":11,"name":"Hybrid\/mixed Beer","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Fruit Beer","shortName":"Fruit Beer","description":"Fruit beers are any beers using fruit or fruit extracts as an adjunct in either, the mash, kettle, primary or secondary fermentation providing obvious (ranging from subtle to intense), yet harmonious, fruit qualities.

At Philadelphia Brewing Co we take pride in our brews, our people, and our community. One person could never do everything that it takes to get beer into your glass. And it may sound obvious, but we won't brew anything that we wouldn't drink ourselves - you won't catch us drinking anything called Ultra unless it's a literal name meaning more flavor, more hops, more malt, more carbs. That's because we are Brewers; proud brewers of fine hand crafted Ales from our historic brewery building in the Kensington neighborhood of Philadelphia. Now that's out of the way; we will be starting out with four mainstay brews which will be available in draught and in bottles. Once we're stocked up on the core brews we'll start pumping out regular seasonal or specialty brews. The specialty series will be driven by our individual brewers and the desires and whims of the rest of our family.  The beer is flowing at Philadelphia Brewing co!
