David was using the name Creature Comforts for his personal home brews and that name became the foundation for the brewery we run today.

Building in a 1940's warehouse presented a lot of challenges as well as many wonderful opportunities.

Through a long journey that ended with a very serendipitous introduction that came via a person in Vancouver, British Columbia, Chris Herron, a Georgia native himself who was living in Connecticut, became the CEO of Creature Comforts.

We have since added, Blake Tyers a veteran and forward thinking home brewer as a brewer at Creature Comforts, and we brought on Katie Beauchamp to manage our office activities, tours and special events.  Combined with the nearly 20 part time tour staff we have, our entire family is together and we have  20+ years of experience.\r\n\r\nWhat started out as curious exploration of what we love, turned into us uncovering our passion, following that passion, and finding happiness, which has allowed us to enjoy the Creature Comforts of life.   Creature Comforts Brewing Company is truly our very own creature comfort.  Our brewery is what makes us happy, it is what makes us feel at home, it is what comforts us, and puts us in a happy place.  Creature Comforts is the end result of the story of our past and the starting point for the story our future, and we look forward to writing that story with you.","website":"http:\/\/www.creaturecomfortsbeer.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/POBUM3\/upload_oQan0u-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/POBUM3\/upload_oQan0u-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/POBUM3\/upload_oQan0u-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/POBUM3\/upload_oQan0u-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/POBUM3\/upload_oQan0u-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-11-07 00:01:58","updateDate":"2016-06-13 13:52:05","locations":[{"id":"r9KC4e","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"271 W.

When creativity, aspirations, and equipment got a little too large for our tiny garages the inevitable craft brewery was born. We continue to be grounded in family, friends, beer education, and the quest for the ever perfect pint. We focus on the range of flavors beer can provide, and offer an ever-changing variety of styles in our brewpub.

The unique combination of yeast and lactic acid bacteria fermentation yields a beer that is acidic, highly attenuated, and very light bodied. The carbonation of a Berliner Weisse is high, and hop rates are very low. Clarity may be hazy or cloudy from yeast or chill haze. Hop character should not be perceived. Fruity esters will be evident. No diacetyl should be perceived.","ibuMin":"3","ibuMax":"6","abvMin":"2.8","abvMax":"3.4","srmMin":"2","srmMax":"4","ogMin":"1.028","fgMin":"1.004","fgMax":"1.006","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:29:14"}},"breweries":[{"id":"kkcQtN","name":"Bayerischer Bahnhof Brau & Gastst\u00e4ttenbetrieb GmbH","nameShortDisplay":"Bayerischer Bahnhof Brau & Gastst\u00e4ttenbetrieb GmbH","website":"http:\/\/www.bayerischer-bahnhof.de\/","established":"2000","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-07 10:19:57","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:35:23","locations":[{"id":"yGAYTg","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Bayrischer Platz 1","locality":"Leipzig","region":"Sachsen","postalCode":"04103","latitude":51.336966,"longitude":12.391295,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"DE","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-08-12 14:46:51","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"DE","name":"GERMANY","displayName":"Germany","isoThree":"DEU","numberCode":276,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"6w45yz","name":"Berliner Style Weisse (Brettan)","nameDisplay":"Berliner Style Weisse (Brettan)","abv":"3","styleId":46,"isOrganic":"N","beerVariationId":"NtNFHi","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-07-31 20:08:23","updateDate":"2014-07-31 20:08:23","style":{"id":46,"categoryId":4,"category":{"id":4,"name":"German Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Berliner-Style Weisse (Wheat)","shortName":"Berlinerweisse","description":"This is very pale in color and the lightest of all the German wheat beers.
