We started out modestly as Home Brew Mart in 1992. Our goal was to teach others how to brew quality handcrafted beer at home. In 1996 the brewery was installed by New World Brewing Systems in the space behind our retail store and production began in September. In May of 2005 we open our second brewery in Scripps Ranch.  We currently distribute five of our favorite beers, Yellowtail Pale Ale,  Calico Amber Ale , Big Eye I.P.A., Black Marlin Porter and Wahoo Wheat Beer to a thirsty San Diego.  Come to our brewery and we will gladly give you a tour and allow you to sample our newest selection of beers. Currently our beer is available in twelve ounce bottles to 15.5 gallon kegs. We also offer half gallon and gallon glass jugs to go. Kegs are available for rent to the public with a minimum deposit.  The name for our brewery comes from the point where Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo first set foot in California. Located on the Point Loma Peninsula, Ballast Point is considered the gateway to San Diego Harbor. Stones from this area were used as ballast in the cargo holds of sailing ships returning to the eastern seaboard.

In 1996 the brewery was installed by New World Brewing Systems in the space behind our retail store and production began in September. In May of 2005 we open our second brewery in Scripps Ranch.  We currently distribute five of our favorite beers, Yellowtail Pale Ale,  Calico Amber Ale , Big Eye I.P.A., Black Marlin Porter and Wahoo Wheat Beer to a thirsty San Diego.  Come to our brewery and we will gladly give you a tour and allow you to sample our newest selection of beers. Currently our beer is available in twelve ounce bottles to 15.5 gallon kegs. We also offer half gallon and gallon glass jugs to go. Kegs are available for rent to the public with a minimum deposit.  The name for our brewery comes from the point where Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo first set foot in California.

John Matthias Falliers founded Frankenmuth\u2019s first brewery in 1857. Cousins William Knaust and Martin Heubisch opened the Cass River Brewery just north of the Fallier property in 1862, where the Frankenmuth Brewery continues to stand today.\r\n\r\nThe Cass River Brewery was purchased by Johann Geyer in 1874, and renamed Geyer\u2019s Brothers Brewing Co. For the next 112 years, the facility operated under many names including the Frankenmuth Brewing Co. Ferdinand \u201cFred\u201d Schumacher from Duseldorf, Germany, purchased the brewery one year before a fire destroyed most of the structure in 1987.\r\n\r\nThe microbrewery continued operation following ownership acquisition by Randall E. Heine in 1990. The nation\u2019s second oldest microbrewery was at peak production in 1996, distributing more than 30,000 barrels of locally produced microbrews across 25 states, when a F3 tornado struck our facility, causing several million dollars of damage. A brew pub was opened in 2003 and closed three years later.\r\n\r\nOur Frankenmuth Brewing Company, housed in the historic four story, 28,000 square foot building is an exciting destination for food lovers and beer aficionados alike.","website":"http:\/\/frankenmuthbrewery.com\/","established":"1862","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/xUwGtE\/upload_1DNBW7-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/xUwGtE\/upload_1DNBW7-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/xUwGtE\/upload_1DNBW7-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/xUwGtE\/upload_1DNBW7-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/xUwGtE\/upload_1DNBW7-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:11:49","locations":[{"id":"IgdWNj","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"425 S Main Street","locality":"Frankenmuth","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"48734","phone":"989-262-8300","website":"http:\/\/frankenmuthbrewery.com\/","latitude":43.330981,"longitude":-83.737896,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1862","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
