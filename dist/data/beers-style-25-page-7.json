Our first Seattle location, a 220-seat beer hall and our main brewery, opened in 1996 on Capitol Hill, Seattle\u2019s most populous neighborhood. In 1997 Elysian was chosen to operate a pub and small brewery at Gameworks\u2014a large entertainment complex owned by Universal Studios, Dreamworks & Sega. Elysian left this partnership in 2002 upon expiration of the five-year contract. A short year later Elysian opened TangleTown, an 80-seat neighborhood brewery\/bistro. With a 3-bbl pilot brewery, Elysian-TangleTown acted as the brewers' test kitchen, fueling the creative fires and helping cement Elysian's reputation as Seattle\u2019s top brewpub. The most recent addition to the Elysian empire, Elysian Fields, opened in August 2006. Perched next to Seattle\u2019s two sports arenas, Fields seats 400 and packs the house at lunch and on gamedays. It is typical for us to offer over twenty different Elysian beers between the three locations.","website":"http:\/\/www.elysianbrewing.com\/","established":"1995","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/hvWfx5\/upload_Ml4tjJ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/hvWfx5\/upload_Ml4tjJ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/hvWfx5\/upload_Ml4tjJ-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/hvWfx5\/upload_Ml4tjJ-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/hvWfx5\/upload_Ml4tjJ-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:07:42","locations":[{"id":"QbZbCr","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1221 East Pike Street","locality":"Seattle","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98122","phone":"206-860-3977","website":"http:\/\/www.elysianbrewing.com\/","latitude":47.614033,"longitude":-122.315716,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"7S4DH1","name":"TangleTown","streetAddress":"2106 N 55th St, Seattle, WA 98103","locality":"Seattle","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98103","phone":"206-547-5929","website":"http:\/\/www.elysianbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"M-F: Opens 11:30AM\r\nSat:  11AM - 11PM\r\nSun. 11AM - 10PM","latitude":47.668918,"longitude":-122.333473,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1995","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:14","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"PZL75k","name":"Barrel-Aged Thunder Ann","nameDisplay":"Barrel-Aged Thunder Ann","styleId":25,"isOrganic":"Y","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-07-14 21:19:48","updateDate":"2015-07-14 21:19:49","style":{"id":25,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"American Pale","description":"American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color.

This majestic white oak stands in the middle of where the road would have gone, if not for this tree\u2019s historical significance.  If you look closely at the trunk of this old oak, you will notice the mark of an equal armed cross carved into its bark. The cross was carved sometime between 1775 and 1776 when Spanish Lt. Colonel Juan Batista de Anza led more than 240 men, women and children on an overland journey from the frontier New Spain to settle in Alta California. During that 1,200 mile journey, the very thirsty Colonel carved the cross to signify the perfect location for a brewery\u2026well, that\u2019s our story at Barrelhouse and we can\u2019t exactly prove it, but we\u2019re sticking to it!  Historians believe that Juan Batista de Anza or someone on his team carved the cross to indicate a safe place to camp.

The family has since expanded with the addition of two daughters-in-law -- Talar and Rachel -- and grandson's Nico (so much for that \"D\" thing!) and Dillon. We've always been a very close family and love doing things together whether it's vacations, home improvement projects, sporting events, or just hanging out. We've long had a dream of starting our own business, and so we finally decided to take our love of craft beer, combined with our home-brewing experience, to create Four Sons Brewing. The picture below is a shot of the whole group and when you visit our tasting room you will likely see most (if not all) of us there. (Oh, by the way, we are huge LA Kings fans!).

The beautiful hand-carved, hand-split Philippine mahogany bar was created to serve the whiskey distilled on the second floor. The saloon enjoyed a brisk business from the turn of the century until the advent of prohibition in 1920. The building, rich in history, is on the national registry of historic landmarks and has been restored to much of its original grandeur. Among the original architectural elements that remain today are the beautiful bar, intricate mosaic tile floor, much of the stained glass and of course the decorative ceiling. The luxurious back-bar won the coveted blue ribbon for craftsmanship at the 1893 World Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Many myths and legends surround this historic building, including the presence of ghosts and spirits.

Hopped with beautiful Mosaic hops, renowned for their tropical fruit beauty, helped along with some nice orangey Amarillo hops both at the end of the boil and in the dry hop. It is unfined, so naturally hazy. A moreish bitterness is complimented by tropical fruit tastiness.","abv":"4.2","styleId":25,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-07-30 22:46:54","updateDate":"2015-07-30 22:46:55","style":{"id":25,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Pale Ale","shortName":"American Pale","description":"American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color. The style is characterized by fruity, floral and citrus-like American-variety hop character producing medium to medium-high hop bitterness, flavor, and aroma. Note that the \"traditional\" style of this beer has its origins with certain floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American hop varietals. One or more of these hop characters is the perceived end, but the perceived hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. American pale ales have medium body and low to medium maltiness. Low caramel character is allowable. Fruity-ester flavor and aroma should be moderate to strong. Diacetyl should be absent or present at very low levels. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.","ibuMin":"30","ibuMax":"42","abvMin":"4.5","abvMax":"5.6","srmMin":"6","srmMax":"14","ogMin":"1.044","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.014","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:25:18"},"breweries":[{"id":"kGYkIn","name":"Wild Beer Co.","nameShortDisplay":"Wild Beer Co.","description":"Wild Beer, Wild Yeasts, Wild Ingredients, Wild Ideas, Wild Ambitions...","website":"http:\/\/wildbeerco.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/kGYkIn\/upload_EmdQUL-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/kGYkIn\/upload_EmdQUL-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/kGYkIn\/upload_EmdQUL-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/kGYkIn\/upload_EmdQUL-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/kGYkIn\/upload_EmdQUL-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-04-01 14:50:41","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:53:14","locations":[{"id":"Ryy587","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"Lower Westcombe Farm","extendedAddress":"Evercreech Shepton Mallet","locality":"Somerset","region":"England","postalCode":"BA4 6ER","website":"http:\/\/wildbeerco.com\/","latitude":51.1517774,"longitude":-2.4633889,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"GB","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-04-01 14:52:34","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"GB","name":"UNITED KINGDOM","displayName":"United Kingdom","isoThree":"GBR","numberCode":826,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]}],"status":"success"}
