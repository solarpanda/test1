Fordham Brewing remains true to its roots, its recipes and Annapolis heritage.","website":"http:\/\/fordhambrewing.com\/","established":"1703","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/D3A2mu\/upload_QbkkUF-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/D3A2mu\/upload_QbkkUF-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/D3A2mu\/upload_QbkkUF-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/D3A2mu\/upload_QbkkUF-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/D3A2mu\/upload_QbkkUF-squareLarge.png"},"status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2016-02-17 19:33:18","locations":[{"id":"Axcxdt","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1284 McD Drive","locality":"Dover","region":"Delaware","postalCode":"19901","phone":"302-678-4810","website":"http:\/\/fordhambrewing.com\/","latitude":39.1540034,"longitude":-75.4883626,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"deleted","statusDisplay":"Deleted","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:55","updateDate":"2015-05-04 15:06:01","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"rZJL6V","name":"Copper Moon","nameDisplay":"Copper Moon","description":"Copper Moon has a bit more malt quality and hop character than most other summer seasonals, giving rise to a refreshing, flavorful beer style that we like to identify as a Summer Pale Ale. On top of that, all of the malted barley used in every batch of Copper Moon is organically grown and malted. The outcome is a smooth, flavorful summer pale ale made with 100% Organic malted barley.\r\n\r\nThe first thing you'll notice about Copper Moon is the coppery orange luminescence radiating out of the pint glass. This comes from the special combination of three different Organic malts in every batch. Those Organic malts also impart a flavorsome yet summery smooth sweetness that quenches your thirst at the same time as tantalizing your taste buds. The upfront hop bitterness of Copper Moon is relatively low, complementing the malts nicely without being overpowering. The hop flavor and aroma are another matter, as the Centennial hops used in the latter stages of each batch intermingle delightfully to generate a dazzling citrusy, flowery and slightly spicy olfactory experience. All these things blend into a refreshing, flavorful and organic Summer Pale Ale. There's a Copper Moon risin' again this summer across McMenamins; make sure that you check it out.","abv":"5.03","ibu":"47","glasswareId":5,"srmId":7,"availableId":6,"styleId":32,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/rZJL6V\/upload_NJKpO9-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/rZJL6V\/upload_NJKpO9-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/rZJL6V\/upload_NJKpO9-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","originalGravity":"1.048","createDate":"2012-10-04 18:15:22","updateDate":"2015-12-16 19:42:49","glass":{"id":5,"name":"Pint","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"srm":{"id":7,"name":"7","hex":"F39C00"},"available":{"id":6,"name":"Summer","description":"Available during the summer months."},"style":{"id":32,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Amber\/Red Ale","shortName":"Amber","description":"American amber\/red ales range from light copper to light brown in color.

In 2011 our breweries collectively crafted 3302 batches of beer (including over 250 new and unusual house-specific recipes) more than 47,263 kegs of beer or an astounding 5.8 million pints!\r\n\r\nIn keeping with McMenamins' company philosophy, our breweries believe that brewing \"green\" is brewing responsibly.\r\n\r\nMany beer lovers are familiar with our ales, such as Terminator Stout, Hammerhead, Ruby, Edgefield Wheat, Black Rabbit Porter, Sunflower IPA and others. Read more about these \"standards\" and dozens of others, including our beloved seasonal ales.\r\n\r\nDue to the nature of handcrafting, it's safe to say that no two McMenamins batches are identical. Science and technology provide the backbone for our craft, but it is the unique qualities of each brew house, and the individual brewer's ale-crafting style, that ensure you will enjoy liquid refreshments that are truly special and made with every care for the environment.

Mark continued on with his brewing education by completing the Web-based Concise Course in Brewing Technology at the Siebel Institute of Technology World Brewing Acadamy from which he obtained his Certificate.   We selected our location nestled in the heart of the beautiful Finger Lakes Region of upstate New York for its close proximity to Keuka Lake and the availability for lake water for brewing. Our building offered a spacious workable layout, ample parking and room for future expansion. We began our building renovations and equipment installation in early 2010,  received our license in the fall of 2010, and on November 11th, 2010 opened our doors for tours, tastings, and growler fills. \r\n\r\nOur Brew Room features a matched Ripley 7 Barrel Stainless Steel Brewing system. The Brew House includes a Boil Kettle, Mash Tun and Hot Liquor Tank. The Brew Room also features 3 double wall digital temperature controlled fermentation tanks, grain mill, filter, and other assorted brewing equipment. Adjacent to the brew room is a walk-in cooler containing 8 - 7 Barrel Stainless Steel Serving Tanks and assorted keg filling and dispensing equipment. \r\n\r\nThe entrance way and tasting room offer large windows for great views of the Brew Room  as well as a large comfortable area for you and your friends to relax and visit while enjoying your favorite brews offered fresh daily. We offer tastings and growler fills of fine crafted ales and root beer all brewed on premises as well as guided tours on non-brewing days. Have your own growlers, we fill your clean growlers.
