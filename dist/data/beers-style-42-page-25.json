They met in September 2002 in the tiny Scottish village of St. Andrews, Scotland. Bailey was a Harvard student doing a semester abroad and Robyn was beginning undergrad at St. Andrews. They bonded over being put into the worst dorm for overseas orientation and teaching Danish people how to play beer pong. Though after three months Bailey went back to Cambridge, you can't break the bonds that are made when teaching Europeans drinking games and a true friendship was born. During the next eight years, they both graduated, Bailey went off to Vanderbilt Law School, and Robyn entered the working world, but both thought they were meant for much bigger and more alcoholic things.","website":"http:\/\/www.jackalopebrew.com\/","established":"2011","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/p1tFbP\/upload_FgvJzY-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/p1tFbP\/upload_FgvJzY-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/p1tFbP\/upload_FgvJzY-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/p1tFbP\/upload_FgvJzY-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/p1tFbP\/upload_FgvJzY-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:04:10","locations":[{"id":"Syl46S","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"701 8th Avenue South","locality":"Nashville","region":"Tennessee","postalCode":"37203","phone":"857-998-2571","website":"http:\/\/www.jackalopebrew.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Thursday: 4PM - 8PM\r\nFriday: 4PM - 8PM\r\nSaturday: 4PM - 8PM","latitude":36.1503749,"longitude":-86.779494,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2011","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:58","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Xj7zte","name":"Whiskey Stout","nameDisplay":"Whiskey Stout","styleId":42,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:44:30","updateDate":"2012-03-22 13:04:47","style":{"id":42,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Stout","shortName":"American Stout","description":"Initial low to medium malt sweetness with a degree of caramel, chocolate and\/or roasted coffee flavor with a distinctive dryroasted bitterness in the finish.

Our 7 barrel stainless-steel brew system was custom manufactured for us by JV Northwest, Inc. in Oregon and is now housed in a separate building directly behind the restaurant.\r\n \r\nOur seven barrel stainless steel brewhouse produces a wide range of ales and lagers year round using the finest imported and domestic ingredients available. Our commitment to quality, consistency, and continued brewing knowledge has garnered us several awards through the years and is evident in the final product\u2014the fresh pint poured off our taps.\r\n \r\nWe are currently producing 800 barrels a year. We pride ourselves on creating small batches of hand crafted ales and lagers covering a variety of beer styles. Our wide range of styles and ever-changing lineup of beers allows us to have something to please every palate.

Flavors harmonize, not fight for individual attention. Triangle beers are not pasteurized nor do we add preservatives (except for a healthy addition of hops). Seeing beer as equal to, if not superior to, wine, Triangle beers are designed to complement food. Because of this effort, soon one will be able to walk into any fine restaurant and pub in the Raleigh, Durham, Chapel Hill region and be pretty sure of finding a Triangle beer available.","website":"http:\/\/www.trianglebrewery.com","established":"2007","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ahlcqI\/upload_aD5CKc-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ahlcqI\/upload_aD5CKc-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ahlcqI\/upload_aD5CKc-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ahlcqI\/upload_aD5CKc-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ahlcqI\/upload_aD5CKc-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:06:18","locations":[{"id":"OblNj8","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"918 Pearl Street","locality":"Durham","region":"North Carolina","postalCode":"27701","phone":"919-683-2337","website":"http:\/\/www.trianglebrewery.com","hoursOfOperation":"Tours every Saturday 1pm to 2:30pm","latitude":35.996523,"longitude":-78.889416,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2008","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:10","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"MiZkMH","name":"Winter Stout","nameDisplay":"Winter Stout","description":"This Stout is brewed with four different roasted malts.

Rogue's first brewpub was located in Ashland, Oregon and was a 10bbl brewsystem. Rogue opened a second brewpub, 15bbl brewsystem, in May 1989 located in Newport, Oregon. Rogue closed its Ashland operation in 1997, after the great flood destroyed the place. In 1991, the 15bbl system, named Howard after John Maier's former boss, from the Newport brewpub was transferred across the bay to the current brewery and upgraded to a 30bbl system. In 1998 Rogue bought a 50bbl brewsystem, named Kobe. Kobe is the only brewsystem in use. Tours: We offer brewery tours every day at 3 pm (followed by a distillery tour at 4pm). Go up to the bar inside the brewery (Brewers on the Bay) and check in with the bartender and the tour will commence. Please call ahead if you have a large group and or to verify the tour time...Brewer's on the Bay phone is 541-867-3664.
