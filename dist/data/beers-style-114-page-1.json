The brewery was Aurora, Colorado\u2019s first when owners Kevin DeLange and Michelle Reding opened with a 7 BBL brewhouse in a 900-square-foot space next their original business The Brew Hut, a homebrew supply shop, in 2005. They named the brewery as a nod to Kevin\u2019s love of nautical history.\r\n\r\nDry Dock expanded in 2009, and again in 2011. Now the brewery runs a 7 BBL brewhouse including a tasting room with 180 seats and 16 taps at its original location at 15120 E. Hampden Avenue which is called South Dock.\r\n\r\nIn 2013, Dry Dock nearly quadrupled its production numbers, jumping from 3,200 barrels in 2012 to 12,000 barrels in one year. This increase came with the purchase of a 30,000-square-foot production facility, North Dock, at 2801 Tower Road. At North Dock, Dry Dock has the capacity to expand to brew more than 30,000 barrels a year, and cans its flagship line of beers, including the Amber Ale, Hop Abomination, Hefeweizen, and Apricot Blonde.\r\n\r\nIn September of 2014, Dry Dock opened the Canoe Room, a four-tap tasting room inside of its North Dock facility. The tasting room, which in addition to draft beer, serves Dry Dock\u2019s canned offerings. The room was once the storage area for The Boy Scouts of America Aurora chapter\u2019s canoes and the area gained the nickname \u201cCanoe Room,\u201d which stuck.\r\n\r\nDry Dock established itself early on by word-of-mouth, and put itself on the map when it won a gold 2006 World Beer Cup (only 6 months after the tiny brewery opened) for its HMS Victory ESB (now Dry Dock\u2019s Amber Ale). Dry Dock has since been the recipient of 20 GABF\u00ae medals, the prestigious Brewers Association\u2019s Small Brewery of the Year award, and five World Beer Cup\u00ae awards.","website":"http:\/\/www.drydockbrewing.com\/","established":"2005","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/fn89yQ\/upload_HXm8qn-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/fn89yQ\/upload_HXm8qn-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/fn89yQ\/upload_HXm8qn-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/fn89yQ\/upload_HXm8qn-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/fn89yQ\/upload_HXm8qn-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:53","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:07:28","locations":[{"id":"LWD44j","name":"South Dock","streetAddress":"15120 E.

He started the Boulder, Colorado company with the 'natural philosophy' that he produce the highest quality honey wine on the market.\r\n\r\nBecause of this 'philosophy of mead', Redstone does not cork (to avoid oxidation) but instead uses swing top bottles. This ensures the mead will not breathe while cellaring plus offers a much longer shelf life once the bottle has been opened.\r\n\r\nIn keeping with the 'natural' approach, Redstone does not add any sulfites, a known allergen, as honey is it's own natural preservative. Redstone only pasteurizes the must (unfermented mead) and never boils. The company strives to feature the flavors of the fermentable as much as possible.\r\n\r\nIn 2003 Redstone Meadery brought the International Mead Festival (www.meadfest.com) to Boulder, Colorado and with that helped to establish mead as its own beverage category. Also at this time Redstone spearheaded the creation of the International Mead Association (www.meadfest.org) to help promote and educate the masses about the world's first fermented beverage.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Redstone products are distributed to 20 states across the U.S., making it the widest distributed wine from the state of Colorado and one of the most widely distributed meads in the country!

Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Quaff On!","description":"Quaff: To drink heartily and with gusto!\r\n\r\nAt Quaff ON! Brewing Company, 'Gusto' is part of everything we do. Our hand-crafted beers reflect our passion for the brewer's art and our commitment to creating beers that excite and delight the quaffer's palette.\r\nQuaff ON! Brewing Company was formed in 2012 in response to the demand for the iconic craft beers we developed at Big Woods Brewing Company, our brewpub located in the heart of Brown County Indiana. Why 'Quaff ON!'? Because from the day Big Woods threw open its doors in 2009, Quaff ON! has been the rallying cry, the toast, and the salutation of our loyal fans.\r\nWhen Big Woods founders Jeff McCabe, Tim O'Bryan and Ed Ryan decided to create Quaff ON! Brewing Company, they had one Master Brewer in mind to take Busted Knuckle Ale, Hare Trigger IPA, Six Foot Blonde and Timid Virgin Pale to new heights and a larger market. That Brewer is Mark Havens, whose reputation as a talented and committed 'creator of craft beers' is well known. Mark came on board in time to lend a hand in the conversion of our 60 year old bowling alley into the Quaff ON! brewing facility.\r\nOnce Mark got the new brewery up and running and our original Big Woods recipes were in production, Mark began introducing new beers, including Yellow Dwarf Wheat, a hopped up wheat that begs to be quaffed and Sadie the Goat Brown Ale, a hearty homage to the substantial beers quaffed by river pirates 2 centuries ago.\r\nCurrently Quaff ON!'s beers are distributed all over Indiana. Look for us at your favorite watering hole and in the craft beer section at package stores throughout the state. If Quaff ON! is not served at your favorite place, send us a note and we'll get it in there! If you're travelling our way, stop in and see us in Brown County and visit us in Nashville at Big Woods Village where you can enjoy fine craft beer, great food and the best in local entertainment.\r\n\r\n\"Love all, trust a few, do wrong to none.\" - William Shakespeare","website":"http:\/\/www.quaffonbrewing.com\/home.html","established":"2009","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/f8oZ5j\/upload_Tp27HU-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/f8oZ5j\/upload_Tp27HU-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/f8oZ5j\/upload_Tp27HU-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/f8oZ5j\/upload_Tp27HU-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/f8oZ5j\/upload_Tp27HU-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:46","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:18:17","locations":[{"id":"qZJOHj","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"60 Molly Ln","locality":"Nashville","region":"Indiana","postalCode":"47448","phone":"813-988-6000","website":"http:\/\/www.bigwoodsbeer.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Thur: 11:30am - 9pm\r\nFri - Sat: 11:30am - 10pm\r\nSun: 11:30am - 9pm","latitude":39.2079575,"longitude":-86.2484171,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:46","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"njfzWt","name":"Cherry Wheat","nameDisplay":"Cherry Wheat","description":"This classic American style delicately weaves sweet Oregon cherries with a soft wheat base.

Diacetyl should not be perceived. When this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops.

Our brewing philosophy is simple - we use quality ingredients and work very hard to ensure quality and consistency. We source our hops and cider apples locally, and our malts from suppliers in both the South and North Islands. Our specialty malts that provide the colour and flavour for some of our different beer styles are sourced from South Canterbury, Germany and the United Kingdom. We use the local town supply water, which is extremely good quality for our beer and cider production.\r\n\r\nOur beers and ciders are produced using all natural ingredients and are unpasteurised to retain their full flavour. We call it 'Real Live Beer' and encourage you to keep it well refrigerated to maintain quality and freshness.","website":"http:\/\/www.sprigandfern.co.nz\/","mailingListUrl":"info@sprigandfern.co.nz","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/H5ONML\/upload_umg3CS-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/H5ONML\/upload_umg3CS-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/H5ONML\/upload_umg3CS-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/H5ONML\/upload_umg3CS-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/H5ONML\/upload_umg3CS-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-22 00:15:19","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:05:14","locations":[{"id":"VWuTZv","name":"Tinakori Road Sprig & Fern Tavern","streetAddress":"342 Tinakori Rd","locality":"Thorndon","region":"Wellington","postalCode":"6011","phone":"04 499 1390","website":"http:\/\/www.sprigandferntaverns.co.nz\/taverns\/tinakori-road-wellington","latitude":-41.2788229,"longitude":174.7691029,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"NZ","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-22 00:15:20","updateDate":"2015-02-27 18:01:49","country":{"isoCode":"NZ","name":"NEW ZEALAND","displayName":"New Zealand","isoThree":"NZL","numberCode":554,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"C7QJgg","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"53 Beach Road","locality":"Richmond","region":"Nelson","postalCode":"7020","phone":"03 544 8675","website":"http:\/\/www.sprigandfern.co.nz\/","hoursOfOperation":"Tue:  12:00pm - 4:30pm\nWed:  12:00pm - 4:30pm\nThu:  12:00pm - 4:30pm\nFri:  12:00pm - 6:00pm\nSat:  12:00pm - 6:00pm\n\n","latitude":-41.3337821,"longitude":173.1860035,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"NZ","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-27 18:04:29","updateDate":"2015-02-27 18:06:29","country":{"isoCode":"NZ","name":"NEW ZEALAND","displayName":"New Zealand","isoThree":"NZL","numberCode":554,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"1vDJn4","name":"Forbidden","nameDisplay":"Forbidden","description":"Driven by supernatural curiosity and ambition to unearth the unexplainable, the Forbidden Traveler probes the earth to uncover mysteries of the past.
