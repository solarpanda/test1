However, the endeavor was well worth it as Brown\u2019s Brewing Company became an instant success as the first brewery restaurant in the Capital Region.\r\n\r\nToday, our River Street Taproom in Troy, New York is a social hub for the community and offers a menu that compliments the beer we brew on site. We brew over 25 different styles of ales and lagers throughout the year and serve over a dozen beers on tap at any one time.

Our mission is to bring to our customers the finest and freshest brews as flavorful alternatives to mass-marketed mainstream products. We're one of the few craft breweries in this region producing both lagers and ales, which require different yeasts and maturation conditions. All Legend beers are unpasteurized and made from only two-row and specialty barley malt, hops, water and yeast.","website":"http:\/\/www.legendbrewing.com\/","established":"1994","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BhfQBs\/upload_rpa3HE-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BhfQBs\/upload_rpa3HE-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BhfQBs\/upload_rpa3HE-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BhfQBs\/upload_rpa3HE-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/BhfQBs\/upload_rpa3HE-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:00","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:06:43","locations":[{"id":"ujtlp3","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"321 West 7th Street","locality":"Richmond","region":"Virginia","postalCode":"23224","phone":"804-232-3446","website":"http:\/\/www.legendbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Thu:\t11:30 am - 11:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat:\t11:30 am - 12:00 am\r\nSun:\t12:30 pm - 10:00 pm","latitude":37.526596,"longitude":-77.442841,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1994","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:00","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"tCPm4t","name":"Brown Ale","nameDisplay":"Brown Ale","description":"Danish: \u00d8llet er inspireret af de engelske brown ales, men er alligevel helt sin egen.

The brewing began in a small apartment kitchen on Pine St. in San Francisco on a stove that could hardly generate a boil. During the first night, it became apparent that we could create the beer that we wanted to drink and the collective that became Pine Street Brewery (PSB) was born. That was goal from the first night of brewing\u2014it was love at first smell.\r\n\r\nPSB moved into the historic Bourne Mansion in Pacific Heights during the Spring of 2010 and called this home until the Fall of 2011. Regular weekly brewing led to lots of experimentation and ten recipes that have become part of the core beer list. During \u201cBrew Nights,\u201d friends were made, a community was fostered and a brand was started.\r\n\r\nPine Street Brewery was designed so that our products would be available for many different palates in many different communities. There is a unique Pine Street in almost every area. We intend for our beer, interpretations of classic styles, to unite people across the US, one beer at a time.\r\n\r\nOur philosophy is to provide a celebration through ales and togetherness.

Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Quaff On!","description":"Quaff: To drink heartily and with gusto!\r\n\r\nAt Quaff ON! Brewing Company, 'Gusto' is part of everything we do. Our hand-crafted beers reflect our passion for the brewer's art and our commitment to creating beers that excite and delight the quaffer's palette.\r\nQuaff ON! Brewing Company was formed in 2012 in response to the demand for the iconic craft beers we developed at Big Woods Brewing Company, our brewpub located in the heart of Brown County Indiana. Why 'Quaff ON!'? Because from the day Big Woods threw open its doors in 2009, Quaff ON! has been the rallying cry, the toast, and the salutation of our loyal fans.\r\nWhen Big Woods founders Jeff McCabe, Tim O'Bryan and Ed Ryan decided to create Quaff ON! Brewing Company, they had one Master Brewer in mind to take Busted Knuckle Ale, Hare Trigger IPA, Six Foot Blonde and Timid Virgin Pale to new heights and a larger market. That Brewer is Mark Havens, whose reputation as a talented and committed 'creator of craft beers' is well known. Mark came on board in time to lend a hand in the conversion of our 60 year old bowling alley into the Quaff ON! brewing facility.\r\nOnce Mark got the new brewery up and running and our original Big Woods recipes were in production, Mark began introducing new beers, including Yellow Dwarf Wheat, a hopped up wheat that begs to be quaffed and Sadie the Goat Brown Ale, a hearty homage to the substantial beers quaffed by river pirates 2 centuries ago.\r\nCurrently Quaff ON!'s beers are distributed all over Indiana. Look for us at your favorite watering hole and in the craft beer section at package stores throughout the state. If Quaff ON! is not served at your favorite place, send us a note and we'll get it in there!

Our goal is to brew world class beers and deliver them to our customers as fresh as possible making them the best beers in Texas and Louisiana. Our customers are beer lovers - people that appreciate great, full-flavored beers.\r\n\r\nOur small crew does everything at the brewery: brew the beer, filter the beer, keg the beer, bottle the beer, sell the beer and drink the beer. For us, this is a passion, not a job. We believe that this comes through in the beers we make. Our beers have soul.\r\n\r\nWe brew several different beers; some are year round, some are seasonal and a few are single batch brews. They are available in bars, restaurants, grocery stores, liquor stores and warehouse stores throughout Texas and Louisiana.\r\n\r\nOur first keg of beer was shipped on June 9, 1994. Founded by Brock Wagner and Kevin Bartol, we chose Houston because, other than living here, this was the largest city in the country that did not have a microbrewery. Brock was a longtime homebrewer and had considered opening a brewery as far back as college, although that was quickly dismissed as a silly idea. Seven years after graduating, Brock revisited the idea, enlisted Kevin's help and the brewery was off and running. Kevin has since left the business after a bitter battle. (Just kidding - but don't you wish people wrote that when it was the truth?).\r\n\r\nPlease visit us if you are in Houston. We have a public open house every weekday at 3:00 PM and every Saturday starting at 11:00 AM.\r\n\r\nCheers!","website":"http:\/\/www.saintarnold.com\/","established":"1994","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/visitor.constantcontact.com\/manage\/optin?v=001uBxRG66eq3ajbdfZ6GjL91di7O20EmmX","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/H3UW27\/upload_rnr6XH-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/H3UW27\/upload_rnr6XH-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/H3UW27\/upload_rnr6XH-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/H3UW27\/upload_rnr6XH-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/H3UW27\/upload_rnr6XH-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:56:40","locations":[{"id":"jPbb33","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2000 Lyons Avenue","locality":"Houston","region":"Texas","postalCode":"77020","phone":"713-686-9494","website":"http:\/\/www.saintarnold.com\/","latitude":29.7715192,"longitude":-95.3484972,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1994","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:07","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"m3Q17y","name":"Brown Island Brown Ale","nameDisplay":"Brown Island Brown Ale","abv":"5.3","styleId":37,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-01-21 15:36:16","updateDate":"2016-01-21 15:36:16","style":{"id":37,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style Brown Ale","shortName":"American Brown","description":"American brown ales range from deep copper to brown in color.
