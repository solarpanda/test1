Jason Hendricks and Jason Schlaff met in the fall of  2009.  They didn\u2019t know then that their friendship would bloom, but when it did, a brewery would be the flower.\r\n\r\nThe Jasons started humbly with a five gallon pot, a homebrew starter kit, and an idea of what good should be.  The first brew was just ok, an American Ale extract kit that did not allow for any artistry.  They quickly realized they needed to switch things up in order to attain the flavors they wanted.  So, the two amateurs ventured into the world of all-grain brewing.  The first mash tun, a cooler, the first brew, a porter.  Jason and Jason had their first failure.  \r\n\r\nPoor taste and terrible color ruined their tongues but not their spirit.  They could do much much better.   Schlaff, an avid reader and researcher, dove head first into every book he could find.  Hendricks scoured the internet and talked to every expert he could find.  Armed with brains full of knowledge the two gents embarked on the brewing adventure again.  \r\n\r\nThe second beer, a blonde ale, crafted with the newfound comprehension they acquired.  After a two weeks of eager anticipation, success!  The Jasons now had the knowledge, the drive, and the skill.  Each ale after that was instant hit among their friends and family.  Gary Schlaff, Jason\u2019s distinguished father, joined the endeavor in 2013.  Gary, a marketing genius, is nearing retirement and has decided to throw his business knowledge into the mix.\r\n\r\nThe brewery itself will not serve or prepare food.  Patrons will be allowed to bring in outside food, as well as have food delivered to them at the brewery.\r\n\r\nWe strive to be as sustainable and as local as possible.  The brewhouse and fermenters will be purchased for Psycho Brew LLC of Greenville, MI.  Our hops will be purchased from the many growers in Michigan.  Our spent grain will be sold to local farmers instead of going to waste in a landfill.  As a side project, we will also used the spent grain to made organic dog treats.","website":"http:\/\/fbcbrewing.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ohbgYE\/upload_WwIcxm-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ohbgYE\/upload_WwIcxm-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ohbgYE\/upload_WwIcxm-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ohbgYE\/upload_WwIcxm-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ohbgYE\/upload_WwIcxm-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-11-24 00:48:05","updateDate":"2016-04-10 21:15:30","locations":[{"id":"fSqavF","name":"Farmington Brewing Company","streetAddress":"33336 Grand River","locality":"Farmington","region":"Michigan","postalCode":"48336","phone":"(248) 957-9543","website":"http:\/\/fbcbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Wed:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\nThu:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\nFri:  4:00pm - 11:00pm\nSat:  2:00pm - 11:00pm\nSun:  2:00pm - 9:00pm\n\n","latitude":42.464946,"longitude":-83.375958,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2014","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-11-24 00:51:59","updateDate":"2016-04-10 21:15:14","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"Frxh8J","name":"Apple Hard Cider","nameDisplay":"Apple Hard Cider","description":"Full-flavored, crisp and refreshing with just the right amount of carbonation.

These hardworking bees are solitary and wild, emerging early in the cool spring just in time to pollinate apple blossoms.\r\n\r\nAt Blue Bee Cider, we aim to create balanced ciders true to their Virginia roots from a culinary perspective and true to the fruit from a cidermaking one. Each apple variety ferments differently, creating its own flavors which vary year to year depending on weather conditions. Blue Bee Ciders are never chapitalized (it\u2019s so sunny in the South, who needs to add sugar?) and never watered down. We use raw juice and ferment it straight off the press.","website":"http:\/\/www.bluebeecider.com","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Foua8q\/upload_KKC87E-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Foua8q\/upload_KKC87E-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Foua8q\/upload_KKC87E-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Foua8q\/upload_KKC87E-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Foua8q\/upload_KKC87E-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-07-28 23:15:13","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:45:02","locations":[{"id":"rwhsCz","name":"Blue Bee Cider","streetAddress":"212 W. 6th Street","locality":"Richmond","region":"Virginia","postalCode":"23224","phone":"(804) 231-0280","website":"http:\/\/www.bluebeecider.com\/","latitude":37.5257172,"longitude":-77.4415178,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2012","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2013-07-29 11:03:49","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"INkkDS","name":"Barrel Aged Johnny Chapman","nameDisplay":"Barrel Aged Johnny Chapman","abv":"7","styleId":149,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-07-17 21:12:50","updateDate":"2014-07-17 22:01:04","style":{"id":149,"categoryId":12,"category":{"id":12,"name":"Mead, Cider, & Perry","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Common Cider","shortName":"Common Cider","description":"Variable, but should be a medium, refreshing drink.

In the Willamette Valley of Oregon where we farm, the ground is an ancient seabed full of rich and nutritious soil. With so much nutrition available to the trees, we have to suppress their vigor through pruning and selection to ensure that each apple receives the most intense nurturing for flavor and aromatics. \r\n\r\nWe grow our apples with specific cidre blends in mind. As you walk the grounds, it becomes clear that it\u2019s organized around specific cultivation and harvesting techniques, enabling us to manage a precise maturation on the tree that we improve with every year\u2019s lessons.","website":"http:\/\/www.ezorchards.com\/cider\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Gh3YR3\/upload_ctCUlq-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Gh3YR3\/upload_ctCUlq-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Gh3YR3\/upload_ctCUlq-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Gh3YR3\/upload_ctCUlq-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Gh3YR3\/upload_ctCUlq-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-07-25 12:58:53","updateDate":"2016-07-25 12:58:53","locations":[{"id":"HhYZh9","name":"Main Cidery","streetAddress":"5504 Hazel Green Rd NE","locality":"Salem","region":"Oregon","postalCode":"97305","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  9:00am - 6:00pm\nTue:  9:00am - 6:00pm\nWed:  9:00am - 6:00pm\nThu:  9:00am - 6:00pm\nFri:  9:00am - 6:00pm\nSat:  9:00am - 5:00pm\n\n","latitude":45.0046179,"longitude":-122.9477643,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-07-25 13:02:17","updateDate":"2016-07-25 13:02:17","country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}}]}]},{"id":"xiw2lx","name":"Cinnamango","nameDisplay":"Cinnamango","description":"An unfiltered spiced cider that is unmistakenly mango.","abv":"6","availableId":2,"styleId":149,"isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-07-28 13:11:16","updateDate":"2016-07-28 13:11:17","available":{"id":2,"name":"Limited","description":"Limited availability."},"style":{"id":149,"categoryId":12,"category":{"id":12,"name":"Mead, Cider, & Perry","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Common Cider","shortName":"Common Cider","description":"Variable, but should be a medium, refreshing drink.
